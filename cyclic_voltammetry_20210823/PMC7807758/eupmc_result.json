The linear potential sweep in the time domain was transformed into the frequency domain using a Fourier transform. The current phasor was estimated by Ohm's law with the voltage phasor and a frequency-dependent CPE, followed by an inverse Fourier transform to determine the current in the time domain. For galvanostatic charging/discharging, the same procedure, apart from swapping the voltage signal with the current signal, was applied. The obtained cyclic voltammetry (CV) shows (1) a gradual increase in the charging current, (2) a higher charging current at a low scan rate, and (3) a deviation from the linear relationship between the charging current and the scan rate. For galvanostatic charging/discharging, the results demonstrate (1) curved charging/discharging behavior, (2) a higher voltage in the early stage, and (3) a lower voltage during longer charging periods. In contrast to a previous approach based on solving a differential equation with a simple RC circuit, our Fourier transform-based approach enables an analysis of electrochemical data with an arbitrary and complex circuit model such as a Randles equivalent circuit. The CPE model is more consistent with previous experimental results than a simple ideal capacitor, indicating a ubiquitous CPE in electrochemistry and a fair figure of merit for supercapacitors.", "affiliation": "Department of Advanced Materials Chemistry, Korea University, Sejong 30019, Korea.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic-eCollection", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.0c04702"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7807758"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7807758?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2021-01-18", "firstIndexDate": "2021-01-19", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2021-01-18", "dateOfRevision": "2021-01-19", "electronicPublicationDate": "2020-12-28", "firstPublicationDate": "2020-12-28"}, "htmllinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7807758", "abstract": "We investigated the charging current in cyclic voltammetry and the galvanostatic charging/discharging behavior of a controversial constant-phase element (CPE) to describe an electrical double layer used only in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.
