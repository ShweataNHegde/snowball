<p>All results were obtained using a house-built MATLAB code to perform the discrete Fourier transform of triangular potential sweep and the corresponding current signal. A simple equivalent circuit for an electrochemical cell consisted of a serial connection of solution resistance (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>s</sub>) and CPE. The current signal at the frequency domain was calculated based on simple Ohm’s law
