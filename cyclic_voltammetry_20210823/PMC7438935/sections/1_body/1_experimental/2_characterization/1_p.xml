<p>Melting point characterization was conducted using Electrothermal fusiometer IA-9200 model 10034137/01. The Z potential of MOF UV-11 was carried out with Zetasizer Nano series from Malvern Instruments. PH solutions were prepared with different values (4, 5, 6 and 7) using an approximate concentration of 185 ppm of MOF UV-11. Stereoscopic microscopy technique was performed using a Motic stereo microscope trinocular model bA310 Pol. For microscopic characterization and energy dispersive spectroscopy (MEB/EDS), JEOL model IT-JSM-300 equipment was utilized with an Oxford X-MaxN model 51-XMX1181 detector. X-ray diffraction was obtained using an INEL EQUINOX 2000 model with a [CoK
 <sub>α</sub> = 1.78901 Å] wavelength, Diffraction spectra were obtained in a range of 10–50° for 2θ, with an incremental step size of 0.02°. The data acquisition time constituted 2 s. To make a comparison of the experimental diffractogram, a theoretical simulated model with Mercury 4.3.1 software, was used.
