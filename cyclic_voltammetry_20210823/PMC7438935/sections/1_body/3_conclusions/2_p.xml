<p>Electrochemical techniques show that MOF UV-11 presents an oxidation peak with a potential of 0.73 V and a reduction peak at 0.67 V, resulting in a semi-reversible process between oxidation and reduction peaks. The voltammetric study at different scanning rates allowed determining thermodynamic values such as the average anodic peak potential at 0.624 V and the cathodic peak at 0.662 V, presenting a formal potential of 0.787 V. There is a difference of potential between the anodic and cathodic peaks of 0.0276 V and the coefficient of the current is 2.706, as well as the kinetic values of the standard speed constant of the anodic process reaction surface of 0.4978 s

These parameters allowed establishing that the process was governed by the electronic transfer of two electrons and the possible electrochemical activation of the MOF structure within the electrode after several voltammetric cycles. The electrochemical performance of the MCPE showed energy and power of an electrochemical micro supercapacitor, useful to miniaturized energy storage systems with a specific areal Capacitance of 40 mFcm
