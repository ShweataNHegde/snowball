<p>Thus, to synthesize and characterize MOF with cobalt is the main objective of this work. It was synthesized and reported by our work group in October 2015 (Alfonso-Herrera et al., 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) in the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center (CCDC) under the number 1434259, called IUPAC catena-[bis(μ-benzene-1,2,4,5-tetracarboxylate)-tris(μ-4-(2-(pyridin-4-yl)vinyl)pyridine]-tetra-cobalt N,N-dimethylformamide solvate (here called MOF UV-11). However, a full characterization for this MOF has not been reported, in spite of it has already been used by other research groups in the post synthesis of this compound for photocatalytic applications in hydrogen evolution degradation of indigo carmine dye (Alfonso-Herrera et al., 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).
