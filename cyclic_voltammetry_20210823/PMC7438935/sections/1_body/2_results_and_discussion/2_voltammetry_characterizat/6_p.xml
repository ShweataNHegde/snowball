<p>From results of MCPE it is possible to obtain the corresponding voltammogram through the difference of oxidation peaks (I
 <sub>OX</sub>) and a reduction (I
 <sub>RED</sub>) (ΔE = E
 <sub>C</sub> – E
 <sub>A</sub>) with a value of 0.030 V and the analysis using the Nernst equation indicates two electrons with a standard potential reduction of 0.775 V, for the ligand reduction process.
