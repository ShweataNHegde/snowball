 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> shows the cyclic voltammetry comparison of the Carbon Paste Electrode (CPE), that works as a control of the electrochemical response in the absence of the MOF, and the modified carbon paste electrode with MOF UV-11 (MCPE, solid line), with a potential range from −0.4 to 1.2 V at a scan rate of 25 mVs
 <sup>−1</sup> and starting in an anodic direction. The inset box shows the redox process expansion that occurs in the range of 0.2–1.1 V.
