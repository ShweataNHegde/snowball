<p>The results of the investment potential study (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>) indicate that the redox processes correspond to the same chemical species, since both the anodic and cathodic peaks depend on the inversion potential value (see insert), with a correlation coefficient of 0.918. It is important pointing out that voltammetry studies show the stability of the MOF in the modified electrode under the potential conditions evaluated because they show reproducibility and repeatability of the redox process.
