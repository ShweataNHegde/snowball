<p>On the other hand, the results shown in the voltammetric study indicate the capacitive and resistive behavior on the surface of the modified electrode. It is possible to observe that the current of the capacitive process of the MCPE is lower than that obtained with the CPE. Likewise, the current associated with the hydrogen evolution process in the MCPE is attributable to the electrode conductivity increased and decrease the resistance due to the MOF presence.</p>
