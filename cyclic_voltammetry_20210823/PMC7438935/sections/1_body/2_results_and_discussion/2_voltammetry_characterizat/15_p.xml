<p>The specific areal capacitance of the MCPE it is lower than the CPE, and both show a diminution of capacitance while the scan rate is increasing. So, its capacitance is lower while increasing the speed of electronic transfer; which favors faradaic processes that can be associated with the electrons in the coordinated orbitals of the metal and pyridyl)-ethylene ligand. These results of CPE are similar with those found for the capacitance and power density on graphite sheet (Mandal et al., 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Likewise, their electrodes modified with metal oxides have a capacitance and power density higher than MCPE (Mijangos et al., 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The order of energy and power implies that MPCE is an electrochemical microsupercapacitor, which are material useful to miniaturized energy storage systems, like the graphene-based electrochemical microsupercapacitors. These values of energy and power are due to the abundance of active and accessible sites in the interface (Yang and Lu,
