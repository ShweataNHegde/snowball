 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref> shows the comparison of cyclic voltammetry at different scan rates (25, 50, and 100 mVs
 <sup>−1</sup>) using the Modified Carbon Paste Electrode (MCPE), in a potential range from −0.4 to 1.2 V, starting the scan towards anodic direction. It is noticed that there is no significant difference in the anodic capacitive charge when changing the scan rate in the potential range of 0.2–0.7 V and it is also noticeable that the potential of the oxidation peak (I
 <sub>OX</sub>) begins to happen at the same value. This is because the electroactive species is on the surface of the electrode. It is observed that increasing the scan rate increases the current value of the oxidation (I
 <sub>OX</sub>) and reduction (I
 <sub>RED</sub>) peaks. This can be described using the Laviron model (Equation 1), which shows the dependence of potential and current peaks at the scanning rate for processes occurring in confined spaces within an electrode (Thomas et al.,
