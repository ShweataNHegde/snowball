<p>In the 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref> it is observed that the peak current is increased logarithmically according to the number of cycles, with a coefficient correlation of 0.9865 and 0.9964 for anodic and cathodic peaks respectively. However, from the last three cycles, significant changes are not observed, which may be attributable to MOF crystalline framework activation over the electrode and could be associated with improved conductivity and decreased interface capacitance of the surface electrode. Likewise, when the program of the voltammetry scanning potential is repeated, the signals are shown in the same potential like the first cycle and do not disappear. In the same way, the current signals grow indicating that the MOF in the modified electrode continues transfer the charge and the redox process.
