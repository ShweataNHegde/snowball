<p>It is observed that CPE response presents an oxidation process with a higher potential of 0.8 V, which is attributed to the oxygen evolution process. By reversing the scan potential direction, a shoulder is observed at âˆ’0.1 V and, subsequently, a reduction process, associated with hydrogen adsorption and evolution, respectively.</p>
