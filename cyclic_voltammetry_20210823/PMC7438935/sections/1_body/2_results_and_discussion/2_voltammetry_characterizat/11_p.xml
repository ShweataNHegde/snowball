<p>With the parameters obtained by the iteration adjustment using the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm, the thermodynamic and kinetic values of the redox processes described are obtained, as shown in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. With an anodic peak potential (
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>pa</italic>
 </sub>) of 0.624 V and a cathodic peak (
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>PC</italic>
 </sub>) of 0.662 V, there exists a standard redox potential of 0.787 V. This indicates that there is a semi-reversible process, since there is a potential difference (Δ
 <italic>E</italic>) between the anodic peak and the 0.027 V cathode and the coefficient of the current is 2.706. The standard velocity constant of the reaction surface (ks) obtained was 0.4978 and 0.275 s
 <sup>−1</sup> for the anodic and cathodic processes, respectively; with values of the electronic transfer coefficient (α) of the anodic and cathodic processes being 0.47 and 0.79, respectively. The average surface concentration of the electrode reaction was also calculated, constituting 1.012 × 10
 <sup>−7</sup> mol
 <sup>*</sup>cm
 <sup>−2</sup>, which describes the average of the slope of the maximum peak current vs. the scan rate.
