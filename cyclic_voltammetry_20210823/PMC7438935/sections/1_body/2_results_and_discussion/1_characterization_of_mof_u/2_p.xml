 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> shows the MOF UV-11 unit cell simulation, corresponding to the molecule simulated using Mercury 4.3.1 software. In the 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> the hydrogen atoms were omitted for better visualization of the molecule structure. The structure of the compound has two cobalt ions. Firstly, the Co1 ion is coordinated with two nitrogen atoms and three oxygen atoms. Meanwhile, the Co2 ion is coordinated with five oxygen atoms and one nitrogen atom; therefore, the structure and the form of coordination have a triclinic crystalline system and a volume unit cell of 1922 Ã….
