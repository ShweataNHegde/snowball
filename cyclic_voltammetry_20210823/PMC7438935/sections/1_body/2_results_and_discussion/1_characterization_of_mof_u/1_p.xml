<p>The method used has a synthesis yield of 72% of the MOF UV-11, and previously activation demonstrated to be necessary in order to keep a permanent pore size to avoid host molecules, without affecting the structural capacity (Farha and Hupp, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The synthesized compound presented a melting point of 292–293°C and show a zeta potential of −10.47 ± 0.99, −8.86 ± 0.81, −10.70 ± 0.49 and −14.60 ± 0.46 mV, for pH of 4, 5, 6, and 7 respectively.
