<p>According to XRD analysis, it was found that it is in agreement to the experimental diffractogram (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>), with the theoretical diffractogram (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>), respect to 2θ at: 11.51°, 14.91°, 18.15°, 18.80°, 22.87°, 24.86° and 31.58°. Likewise, Herrera et al. in 2018, reported the theoretical diffractogram (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>), obtaining the same angles reported here. On the other hand, it is possible to corroborate the peaks absence of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate, used as a precursor, according to the PDF-25-1219 card (Glaspell et al.,
