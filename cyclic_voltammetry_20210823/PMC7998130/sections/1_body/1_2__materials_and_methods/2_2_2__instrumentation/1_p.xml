<p>The morphology of the silver nanowires was characterized using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (JSM-6700F, Japan Electronics Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an energy-dispersive spectroscope (Oxford INCA X sight instrument, Oxford Instruments GmbH, Wiesbaden, Germany). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 advanced X-ray diffractometer (Bruker AXS, Karlsruhe, Germany) equipped with graphite monochromatized Cu-

 <sub>α</sub> radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). XPS was performed on a Thermo Fisher scientific ESCALAB 250 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). The UV-vis and diffuse reflection spectroscopy was conducted on a Hitachi U-4100 (Hitachi, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). All Raman measurements were performed with an Ocean Optics QE65000 spectrometer (Ocean Optics, Dunedin, FL, USA), except for the temporal stability test. The excitation wavelength was 785 nm and the input laser source of the instrument was operated at 50 mW. The diameter of the focused laser beam was about 158 μm. A 7.5 mm objective lens was used, and the integration time was 1 s for recording the SERS spectra. Electrochemical experiments were performed on a Princeton PARSTAT3000A electrochemical workstation (AMETEK Scientific Instruments, Princeton, NJ, USA). The temporal stability was examined using a DXR2 confocal Raman microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) with a 785 nm laser and a 10× objective lens (NA/0.25). The excitation power is 10 mW and the acquisition time of each spectrum was 1 s. The interval of data recording was 5 s.
