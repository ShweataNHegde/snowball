<p>The SERS detections of 
 <italic>p</italic>-aminothiophenol, crystal violet, tetramethylthiuram disulfide, and sodium perchlorate were achieved by immersing the substrate in a large volume of aqueous solution with specific concentrations for 2 h. Then, these substrates were dried in air for detection. The signals of 
 <italic>p</italic>-aminothiophenol, crystal violet, and tetramethylthiuram disulfide were collected and used directly without normalization. Substrates were decorated with DDTC by immersing them in a 10 mM aqueous DDTC solution for 2 h before detecting sodium perchlorate, and the SERS signals were normalized by Raman peak at 1271 cm
