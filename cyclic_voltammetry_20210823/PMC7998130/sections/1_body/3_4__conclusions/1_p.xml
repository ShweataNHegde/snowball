<p>In this study, a highly sensitive flexible SERS substrate was developed by electrochemically treating a silver nanowire membrane. The process is both simple and time-saving. After CV treatment, silver nanoparticles and nanorods were formed on silver nanowires on the surface of the membrane, creating a high density of hot spots. The analytical enhancement factor of the substrate reached 1.24 × 10
 <sup>9</sup> on average, which was 14.4 times higher than that of the untreated one. The substrate showed good stability when exposed in air for a period of time and continuously irradiated with a laser. PATP, crystal violet, thiram and sodium perchlorate were detected on this substrate with concentrations as low as 10
 <sup>−11</sup> M, 10
 <sup>−10</sup> M, 10
 <sup>−10</sup> M, and 10
 <sup>−8</sup> M in solution, respectively. The SERS substrate also can be used to swab analytes from the solid surface, and the detection limits are 0.0365, 0.2, and 0.01 ng for malachite green, fluoranthene, and potassium nitrate, respectively. The LODs of PATP, crystal violet, thiram, sodium perchlorate, malachite green, fluoranthene, and potassium nitrate were calculated to be 3.7 × 10
 <sup>−12</sup> M, 5.1 × 10
 <sup>−11</sup> M, 5.4 × 10
 <sup>−11</sup> M, 6.3 × 10
 <sup>−9</sup> M, 0.00693 ng, 0.0810 ng, and 0.0273 ng, respectively. In addition, the detection on real sample of crystal violet was proven to be feasible. This versatile SERS substrate could find more applications in the on-site inspection.
