<p>Malachite green, both a dye and a fungicide, is a synthetic poisonous triphenylmethane chemical substance that is widely used in the textile and aquaculture industry. Since triphenylmethane substances have significant carcinogenic effects, they can enter the human body through bioaccumulation [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00672-f007">Figure 7</xref>a is the SERS spectra of malachite green. The conventional Raman spectrum of malachite green is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-11-00672">Figure S11a</xref> for comparison. The inset shows the molecular structure of malachite green. The Raman characteristic peaks of malachite green are 801, 918, 1173, 1220, 1296, 1368, 1397, 1594, and 1618 cm
