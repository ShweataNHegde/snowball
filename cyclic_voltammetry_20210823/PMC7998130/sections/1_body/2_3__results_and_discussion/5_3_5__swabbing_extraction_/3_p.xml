<p>Nitrate, a common oxidant in explosives, can be prone to explosion when it comes in contact with most organic substances. The presence of nitrate is a potential threat to public safety. The detection of nitrate can be equivalent to the detection of nitrate ion. As nitrate ions cannot be directly adsorbed on the surface of the substrate, the substrate modified with DDTC was used again to accumulate nitrate ion in swabbing extraction [
