<p>The XRD patterns of the silver nanowire membrane before and after subjecting to CV are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00672-f001">Figure 1</xref>e. The peaks marked with spades in the patterns are attributed to silver-3C (JCPDS No. 87-0597). The comparatively weak characteristic peaks marked with clubs, which appear both in the spectra of untreated and treated silver nanowire membranes, could be assigned to chlorargyrite (JCPDS No. 85-1355). These results are consistent with previous reports wherein silver chloride species are formed at the very beginning of the synthesis and serve as crystal nuclei for the growth of silver nanowires. After CV treatment, silver chloride still exists on the surface of the silver nanowire membrane. It can also be observed that the peaks of silver-3C weaken after CV treatment, indicating that the crystallinity of the silver nanowire membrane decreases after CV treatment. The decrease in the crystallinity of silver nanowires can be attributed to the transformation of some silver nanowires into silver nanoparticles and nanorods.
