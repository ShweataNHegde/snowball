<p>In order to further confirm that the electromagnetic enhancement effect of the CV-treated silver nanowire membrane is stronger than that of the untreated, theoretical simulation was carried under these two situations. In essence, the silver nanowire film is a stack of a large number of silver nanowires. After the CV treatment, some silver nanowires on the membrane surface may dissolve and crystallize into silver nanoparticles or silver nanorods on other silver nanowires surfaces. Based on this, the following models was established, which are shown in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00672-f008">Figure 8</xref>c,d shows the DDA simulations of the electric field on untreated (c) and treated (d) silver nanowire membranes. These simulated images indicate that not only the number of hot spots increases but also the electric field enhancement factor of the hot spots get higher in the CV-treated silver nanowire membrane. Therefore, the enhancement capability of the silver nanowires membrane is greatly improved after CV treatment, which is in agreement with the experimental results.
