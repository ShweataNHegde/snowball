<p>In order to confirm the reproducibility of the SERS sensor, PATP was detected in five replicate samples with a standard sample concentration of 10
 <sup>−6</sup> M. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00672-f005">Figure 5</xref>b, the SERS intensity distribution at 1077 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> shows a low relative standard deviation (RSD) of 0.99%, indicating that the SERS intensity change of the proposed SERS sensor is very small. The temporal stability of the SERS substrate was investigated by collecting the spectra of PATP on the SERS substrates exposed to air and under continuous laser irradiation. The SERS intensity stability of the substrate was investigated. The SERS intensities of 10
 <sup>−6</sup> M PATP with fresh substrate and old (exposed to air for 7 days) substrate were recorded (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00672-f005">Figure 5</xref>c). The substrate exhibited good time stability. Furthermore, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00672-f005">Figure 5</xref>d, there is no significant change in the spectra within 240 s. Taking the peak intensity at 1077 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> as the reference, the RSD was calculated to be 3.4%. Thus, the substrates showed high sensitivity and reliable stability, which could facilitate rapid SERS analysis with this substrate.
