<p>To evaluate the SERS activity of the silver nanowire membrane treated under the optimal CV conditions, the substrates were exposed to different concentrations of PATP (10
 <sup>−7</sup>–10
 <sup>−11</sup> M); The corresponding SERS spectra are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00672-f005">Figure 5</xref>a. The positions of the peaks are basically consistent with those reported in the literature [
 <xref rid="B42-nanomaterials-11-00672" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. As is shown in the insect of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00672-f005">Figure 5</xref>a, taking SERS intensities at 1077 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> into consideration, the SERS signal intensities linearly decrease with the increasing of negative logarithm of PATP concentration within this concentration range. The linear equation was given in the inset of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00672-f005">Figure 5</xref>a within the range of 10
 <sup>−11</sup>–10
 <sup>−9</sup> M and the limit of detection (LOD) of the PATP concentration was discovered to be 3.7167 × 10
 <sup>−12</sup> M (LOD = 3
