 <italic>p</italic>-Aminothiophenol (PATP) was chosen as the probe molecule to evaluate the SERS activity of the silver nanowire substrates subjected to different scanning cycles (5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 CV cycles) at a scan rate of 0.025 V∙s
 <sup>−1</sup> at 20 °C. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00672-f004">Figure 4</xref>a, the SERS signal of PATP increases gradually as the CV scan cycle increases up to the 15th cycle and then decreases. In addition, the temperature of the electrolyte during the CV experiment was also found to affect the SERS performance of the prepared substrate. In order to investigate the relationship between the temperature and Raman activity, substrates treated by CV at different temperatures (16, 18, 20, 22, 24, and 26 °C) were immersed in 10
 <sup>−6</sup> M PATP for 2 h. The SERS spectrum of each substrate is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00672-f004">Figure 4</xref>b. The SERS performance of the substrate increases at first and then decreases with a further increase in the temperature, with the optimal performance being achieved at the temperature of 20 °C. Therefore, 15 CV cycles at 20 °C were chosen as the optimal conditions for treating the silver nanowire membrane.

 <sup>−1</sup> as a function of the cycle number and treatment temperature.
