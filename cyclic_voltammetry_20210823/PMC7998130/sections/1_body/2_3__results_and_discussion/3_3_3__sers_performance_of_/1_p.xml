<p>Before carrying out the experiments about SERS performance, a detailed SERS spectrum of the as-prepared substrate should be collected. 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-11-00672">Figure S6</xref> shows the SERS spectra of raw substrate (red) and substrate washed by sodium borohydride (blue). The black line is background. It can be seen that the interference of impurities is greatly reduced after adding sodium borohydride. All the substrates used in the next experiment were washed by sodium borohydride [
