<p>Some inorganic salt anions are relatively common pollutants in the environment. Among them, perchlorate is a typical toxic chemical substance. It is used extensively in rocket fuel and spreads into the environment upon fuel burning, which is harmful to humans and other species. Perchlorate can interfere with the synthesis and secretion of thyroxine, affect the body’s normal metabolism, and hinder growth and development [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00672-f006">Figure 6</xref>c is the SERS spectra of different concentrations of sodium perchlorate (normalized by Raman peak at 1271 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> of DDTC). Since perchlorate ions cannot be directly adsorbed on the surface of the substrate, DDTC was chosen as a modifier to enrich the perchlorate on the surface of the silver nanowire film by electrostatic action to achieve trace detection [

 <sup>−9</sup> to 10
 <sup>−7</sup> M. The LOD of the thiram concentration was discovered to be 6.3 × 10
 <sup>−9</sup> M.
