<p>To further estimate the feasibility and applicability of the data obtained with the CV treated SERS substrate, pond water from nearby was spiked with various concentrations of crystal violet using the standard addition method. Combining the working curve of crystal violet obtained above (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-11-00672">Table S5</xref>, recoveries range from 88.07% to 101.5%; RSDs range from 1.30% to 5.99%. The results demonstrated that the developed substrate is capable of testing trace crystal violet in real sample.
