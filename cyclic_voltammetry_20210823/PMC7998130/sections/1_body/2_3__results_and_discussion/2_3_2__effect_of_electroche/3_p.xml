<p>Further, silver nanowire membranes treated at different temperatures (15 cycles) were also investigated, and the corresponding SEM images are illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-11-00672">Figure S5</xref>. Different surface morphologies were observed when the temperature was changed. When treated at high temperatures (&gt;20 °C), the silver nanoparticles and nanorods tended to aggregate and grow into larger particles (
