<p>Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV), a simple and commonly used method, can reform the plasmonic nanostructures of SERS substrates through electrocorrosion and electroplating processes to improve the sensitivity of SERS substrates [

 <xref rid="B32-nanomaterials-11-00672" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Herein, electrochemical CV is used to treat silver nanowire membranes to transform a part of the silver nanowires into silver nanorods and nanoparticles. The treated substrates show strong surface plasmon resonance absorption and high surface-enhanced Raman activity, revealing that the electrochemical treatment can significantly increase the density of hot spots of such substrates. The analytical enhancement factor (AEF) of the substrate reaches a value of 1.24 × 10
 <sup>9</sup> on average, which is 14.4 times higher than that of the untreated substrate. In this study, the limits of detection (LODs) for p-aminothiophenol, crystal violet, tetramethylthiuram disulfide, sodium perchlorate, malachite green, fluoranthene, and potassium nitrate are 3.7 × 10
 <sup>−12</sup> M, 5.1 × 10
 <sup>−11</sup> M, 5.4 × 10
 <sup>−11</sup> M, 6.3 × 10
 <sup>−9</sup> M, 0.00693 ng, 0.0810 ng, and 0.0273 ng on this substrate, respectively. Moreover, the feasibility of the developed substrate for crystal violet detection in real samples is also demonstrated. This highly sensitive and flexible SERS substrate may find more applications in the on-site detection of analytes in the future.
