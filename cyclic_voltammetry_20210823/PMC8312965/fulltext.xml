Traditionally, FSCV has depended on the calculation of maximal oxidation currents, measured from known neurochemical concentrations in a solution, which are used to build calibration curves by using linear correlation techniques [<xref rid="pone.0254594.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0254594.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Recent studies have exploited the catecholamine adsorption properties of carbon fiber microelectrodes (CFM), to estimate basal concentrations of neurochemicals [<xref rid="pone.0254594.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0254594.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Techniques including fast scan cyclic adsorption voltammetry (FSCAV) use oxidation-charge measurements, rather than maximal currents, which are obtained by time-integrating cyclic voltammograms within intervals containing single oxidation peaks (or &#x0201c;humps&#x0201d;) [<xref rid="pone.0254594.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0254594.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, the accuracy and reproducibility of oxidation-charge measurements are limited by visual selection of integration bounds of the cyclic voltammogram oxidation peaks. In practice, defining which portion of the voltammogram constitutes an oxidation peak (where it begins, and where it ends) is obscured by the noise floor of the dataset, the electrochemical interferents, the presence of artifacts, and background drift. Visual selection leads to ambiguity, introduces additional sources of error and precludes the development of automated procedures necessary for analysis and charge quantification in large data sets.</p><p>Here, we describe novel charge quantification techniques by performing automatic selection of integration boundaries. This is achieved by analyzing and identifying voltammogram&#x02019;s critical, inflection and maximum curvature points, to allow the automatic selection of integration intervals. We test these techniques in both <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> experimental scenarios.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>2 Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>2.1 In vitro data collection</title><p>The Mayo Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) has reviewed and approved this research.

Rats were sedated prior to surgery with intraperitoneal urethane (1.5 g/kg in a 0.26 g/mL saline solution, Millipore Sigma, Burling- ton, MA). Analgesia was maintained for rodents with intramuscular buprenorphine (0.06 mg/kg). Both the stimulation electrode and CFM were stereotactically inserted (KOPF instruments, Tujunga, CA). A scalp incision (1.5&#x02013;2.0 cm) was made to expose the skull, and three trephine burr holes (approximately 3 mm in diameter) were drilled to allow implantation of the stimulating, neurochemical sensing, and reference electrodes. Dopamine release was evoked with a series 2 s stimulations using a range of amplitudes from 0.05&#x02013;2.0 mA and pulsewidths from 0.8 and 1.8 ms, presented in a randomized order such that effects of hysteresis are minimized. Analyte measurements were obtained by sweeping the CFM potential from a resting potential of -0.4 V to a switching potential of 1.5 V and back to the resting potential, at a rate of 400 V/s every 100ms.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>2.3 Charge quantification</title><p>We define the charge resulting from a single oxidation/reduction reaction by

The relationship between charge and analyte concentration is nonlinear (<xref rid="pone.0254594.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). While linear regressions are regularly used when creating a calibration curves [<xref rid="pone.0254594.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0254594.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], this approach may result in underestimations at the low and high ends of detectable concentrations while overestimations concentrations at the midpoint of the detectible range. Fitting with a nonlinear regression model may reduce these errors when converting between charge and concentration for unknown samples. Furthermore, we present a limited analysis of the performance of automated charge calculation methods in a sample of multiple analytes, but a more exhaustive characterization of charge in the presence of other electroactive interferents (e.g. DOPAC, Guanine, Serotonin, etc.) is necessary to fully determine performance of this approach. Despite these limitations, computational approaches such as the one described here are necessary for improving accuracy and consistency of electroactive neurochemical measurements.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec012"><title>4 Conclusions</title><p>Here, we propose novel methods to quantify charge from REDOX reactions observed in voltammetric measurements electroactive neurochemicals. While our proposed methods were applied to a dataset collected with a traditional FSCV waveform, this approach can be generalized to other voltammetric waveforms reliant on charge quantification, including FSCAV. However, additional studies must be completed to characterize behavior of our approach with novel voltammetric waveforms. Although a definitive selection of integration boundaries is confounded by interferents, background drift, low signal to noise ratio, and other effects, data shown here suggest that our quantification methods are comparable to competing methods for quantification of dopamine oxidation charge, and may more closely approximate true charge when applied to other catecholamines. Additionally, unlike existing charge quantification techniques, our methods can quantify reduction reactions as well as single oxidation or reduction peaks when multiple analytes are present in a sample. Here, charge analysis has been performed automatically, improving reproducibility and demonstrating the feasibility of developing automated routines for charge quantification of multiple analytes.</p></sec><sec id="sec013" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0254594.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Linear charge calibration curve for dopamine, adenosine, and dopamine +adenosine using a)True integration limits b) curvature integration limits, and c) inflection integration limits at concentrations of 0.1 &#x003bc;M, 0.5 &#x003bc;M, and 1 &#x003bc;M.</title><p>Data are fit with a linear regression and R<sup>2</sup> values are displayed for each analyte.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0254594.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0254594.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Wightman</surname><given-names>R.

This technology advancement could serve as a critical improvement to the in vivo basal detection method FSCAV by replacing user-defined integration limits with algorithm-defined cutoffs. This would have the desired effect of removing the possibility for user bias from FSCAV data analysis. This study is highly relevant but requires substantial revision prior to publication.</p><p>Major</p><p>&#x02022; How does the curvature method perform when dealing with small in vivo oxidation peaks resulting from FSCAV basal detection or brief DBS stimulation? The authors state that the desired use for is for this methodology is to provide cutoff limits for in vivo FSCAV experiments. This study should show the applicability of the methodology using FSCAV data.</p><p>&#x02022; The responses in Figure 3 display varying degrees of linearity (none of them highly linear). Please discuss the consequences of this given that linear regression of these responses is used to convert between charge and concentration for unknown samples. Does the degree of linearity for the various methods adjust the determination of which method is best suited for use?</p><p>&#x02022; Please provide detailed statistical analysis between groups to support claims. For example, the author&#x02019;s claim that there is a &#x0201c;significant difference between average left curvature boundaries for DA and NEP&#x0201d; is not supported by statistical evidence.</p><p>&#x02022; There are many cases where the authors neglect discussing data sets within the figures. For example, the authors largely neglect discussing the data arising from the inflection method throughout the entire manuscript as well as the FSCAV limits for EPI. Please discuss all relevant data provided in the figures.</p><p>&#x02022; The authors state that &#x0201c;A region of positive, nearly constant current between 1 and 1.5 volts that persists far into the cathodic sweep is likely the consequence of background drift.&#x0201d; Is there evidence to support that claim? If the feature is drift, why does that drift not occur prior to the oxidation peak (-0.4 V to 0.3 V)?</p><p>&#x02022; What is meant by the &#x0201c;random variation of the DBS stimulation parameters&#x0201d; in the main text when describing the data in Figure 5. Were these data collected using the various duty cycles detailed in Figure 6? What set of conditions were used to produce the response in Figure 5a?</p><p>&#x02022; Are the results detailed in Figure 6b meant to state that the increase in the charge is due to an increase in the extracellular concentration of the in vivo chemical (I assume the chemical is dopamine but the authors never state the identity of the in vivo signal) or is this a consequence of the duty cycle artifact on integration limits? In addition, the authors neglect discussing how the data seem to group by stimulation current as well. Please substantially revise and clarify this discussion.</p><p>&#x02022; It is unclear why the authors would want to optimize quantifying stimulation artifacts in Figure 6. Stimulation timing is routinely staggered with FSCV recordings to ensure that artifacts do not distort background subtracted voltammograms. Please explain.</p><p>&#x02022; The 2nd EPI peak in Figure 8b has clearly not resolved by the switching potential. Cutting at the switching potential does not seem appropriate for obtaining an accurate quantification of the 2nd peak. Is this technique only applicable for targets where the peaks are allowed to totally resolve prior to the switching potential?</p><p>&#x02022; How does the sensitivity for target (DA) detection in the presence of interferent compare to the sensitivity for target alone using the various methods? This is critical to assessing the selectivity of the technique. Please provide the linear calibration data for DA in the presence of interferent (Figure 8a) and compare to response with DA alone.</p><p>Minor</p><p>&#x02022; Please state the specific &#x0201c;computational routines for filtering and smoothing&#x0201d; used in this study.</p><p>&#x02022; How many individual electrodes were tested for both in vitro and in vivo testing? How many animals were used for in vivo testing?</p><p>&#x02022; How is &#x0201c;accuracy&#x0201d; determined when comparing calculated charges from FSCAV limits and curvature limits to the &#x0201c;True Charges&#x0201d;? Does this refer to linear sensitivity? Please be more specific.</p><p>&#x02022; It is notable that the DA, NEP and EPI experiments in Figures 2, 3 and 4 reflect different experimental designs. Why was NEP and EPI tested up to 5 &#x000b5;M whereas DA was only tested to 1 &#x000b5;M? Why were there so few replicates for NEP and EPI as compared to DA? If the authors intend to provide a fair comparison between the responses of various chemicals then the experimental protocols should mimic each other.</p><p>&#x02022; The authors state that &#x0201c;Figure 4 shows an example were curvature integration boundaries provide the best results among the four methods considered&#x0201d;. I only see 3 methods represented (please include the &#x0201c;True&#x0201d; results. Also, what does &#x0201c;best results&#x0201d; mean?</p><p>&#x02022; Please show the peak shape for NEP since the peak shape is shown for DA and EPI.</p><p>&#x02022; Why are average values for the inflection method not displayed on Figures 3 and 4?</p><p>&#x02022; Please provide markings for all four of the limits on Figure 4a (similar to Figure 1a)</p><p>&#x02022; The a) and b) labeling on Figures 1 and 5 are not consistent with the other figures.</p><p>&#x02022; How do the in vivo limits compare to the previous limits defined by FSCAV? Please incorporate those cutoff values into Figures 5a and 5b.</p><p>&#x02022; Average &#x000b1; What? Is it standard deviation? Standard error?</p><p>&#x02022; What do the numbers in the legend of Figure 6a stand for?</p><p>&#x02022; The authors state that there cannot be a &#x0201c;True Limit&#x0201d; for the reduction peak. They previously stated that the switching potential could serve as a limit for the &#x0201c;True&#x0201d; method in cases where the peak does not return to zero (i.e. in vivo data). Wouldn&#x02019;t this justification be applicable here as well and allow for inclusion of the &#x0201c;True&#x0201d; data set into Figure 7?</p><p>&#x02022; It is confusing why the two background-subtracted voltammograms for EPI (Figure 4a and Figure 8b) look so different. Are they at different concentrations? Why is the ratio of the two oxidation peak heights so drastically different between the two responses?</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;This paper presents a novel approach to identify neurochemicals and a clever effort to reduce false observations in FSCV or FSCAV data. Given that most of voltammetric post-analysis methods are prone to misinterpretation, a more mathematical approach &#x02013; like the one presented in this work &#x02013; can contribute to making more accurate statements on the collected biological data. It would be interesting to see how this work would develop in future.</p><p>The paper is well written and the title fits the premises of the target study. I have several rather technical comments to further improve the clarity of the presented method/results (listed here in the order of appearance).</p><p>Abstract-------------------------------</p><p>1. In the last paragraph, the authors claimed, &#x0201c;Our results show that these methods allow quantification of oxidation and reduction reactions, for multiple analytes, both in vitro and in vivo.&#x0201d; however:</p><p>a) the provided results in the manuscript do not fully address in vivo quantification of the reduction reactions (pages 10,3.3). Please correct the text or include more data to support the claim.</p><p>b) the provided data in the manuscript do not support the claim on detection of &#x0201c;multiple analytes&#x0201d; in vivo (see page 10, section 3.2, Figure 6). Please amend the text to better reflect the result or include more data to support the text.</p><p>Method--------------------------------</p><p>2. Please specify what is meant by &#x0201c;A 110 &#x000b5;m CFM&#x0201d;. Both the length and diameter of the used electrode should be provided (page 2, 2.1)</p><p>3. The authors have presented this work as an automatic quantification approach however, the manuscript is missing details on how theses boundary conditions were implemented into an automatized system. Authors should support the concept with a schematic flowchart/algorithm of the applied &#x0201c;routines&#x0201d;. The flowchart should provide an overview of the applied computational procedure for filtering/smoothing and background- subtractions in addition to the correction routines (page 5, 2.3).</p><p>Results and discussion-------------------------------</p><p>4. According to the manuscript, 70 injections of DA and 15 injections of norepinephrine were applied to produce the results (page 5, 3.1). However, it is not clear how many electrodes were used to generate the presented data. Please provide the sample size, i.e. number of electrodes in addition to the number of injections per electrode, for the presented results.</p><p>5. Statistical analysis (including the level of significance) should be included to support the presented comparisons. An optical judgment is indeed a good cue but not sufficient for deciding on the efficacy of the presented method. Here are some example statements which should be statistically backed up:</p><p>&#x0201c;In Figure 4 shows an example were curvature integration boundaries provide the best results among the four methods considered&#x0201d; (page 8, 3.1).</p><p>&#x0201c;Figure 3(b) shows that oxidation charges obtained with curvature limits provide a better approximation to true charges than FSCAV limits.&#x0201d; (page 7, 3.1)</p><p>&#x0201c;&#x02026;curvature boundaries select a wider region than that enclosed by the injection boundaries (figure 1), and they provide a better approximation to the charges obtained by using true boundaries,..&#x0201d; (page 7, 3.1)</p><p>6. Please include one paragraph discussing the limitations and challenging aspects of the proposed approach.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>**********</p><p>6.
