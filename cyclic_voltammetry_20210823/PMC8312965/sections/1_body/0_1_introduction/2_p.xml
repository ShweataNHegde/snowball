<p>Here, we describe novel charge quantification techniques by performing automatic selection of integration boundaries. This is achieved by analyzing and identifying voltammogramâ€™s critical, inflection and maximum curvature points, to allow the automatic selection of integration intervals. We test these techniques in both
