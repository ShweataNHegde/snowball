 <xref rid="pone.0254594.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7(b)</xref> we show the corresponding charges obtained with curvature limits, as well as with inflection limits. We note that for reduction reactions, very often a right true limit is not existent (see 
 <xref rid="pone.0254594.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8(a)</xref> for an example). In consequence charges obtained with true limits are not shown.
