<p>Indeed, 
 <xref rid="pone.0254594.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> shows oxidation-charge calculations with the four pairs of integration boundaries intro-duced in section 2.3. Panel (a) shows calculations for the dopamine dataset corresponding to (

 <xref rid="pone.0254594.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3(a)</xref> shows that when quantifying dopamine charge, the ad-hoc FSCAV limits and curvature are not significantly different at concentrations greater than 0.1μM as demonstrated by a comparison of mean curvature and FSCAV datapoints using an ANOVA with Holm-Sidak comparison for multiple corrections, P&gt;0.05 n.s. However, despite shape similarities between dopamine and norepinephrine background subtracted voltammograms (e. g. correlation coefficient

 <xref rid="pone.0254594.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]), oxidation charges obtained with curvature limits provide a closer approximation to true charges than FSCAV limits at concentrations of 1μM and greater, as demonstrated by a comparison of mean curvature and FSCAV datapoints using an ANOVA with Holm-Sidak comparison for multiple corrections (at 0.5μM, curvature (20.58±0.99) v. FSCAV(19.48±0.88), P = 0.1087 n.s.; at 1μM, curvature (86.84±2.21) v. FSCAV(75.57±1.76), P&lt;0.0001 ****; at 5μM, curvature (27.23±0.6) v. FSCAV(24.88±0.0.56), P&lt;0.01 ****) (
