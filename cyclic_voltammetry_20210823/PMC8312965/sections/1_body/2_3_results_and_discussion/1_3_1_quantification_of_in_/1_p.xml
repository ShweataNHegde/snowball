<p>In 
 <xref rid="pone.0254594.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> we show (a) true and (b-c) curvature integration boundaries obtained with our algorithms. As a reference we also show the location of the maximum oxidation currents with dots, and panels (b- c) show the FSCAV integration limits taken from reference [
 <xref rid="pone.0254594.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], 0.4 V and 0.9 V with vertical dashed lines. The data for panels (a) and (b) corresponds to background subtracted voltammograms of a flow cell experiment, where 70 dopamine injections with 0.1, 0.5 and 1 micromolar were done. The data for panel (c) corresponds to voltammograms of a flow cell experiment, where 15 norepinephrine injections with 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 5 micromolar were done.
