<p>Because of the visual similarities between typical dopamine and norepinephrine background subtracted voltammograms [

 <xref rid="pone.0254594.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], comparisons using norepinephrine data are particularly useful, because they highlight the limitations of using visual identification to obtain integration boundaries. Indeed, panels (b) and (c) of 
 <xref rid="pone.0254594.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> indicate that there is a significant difference between average left curvature boundaries for dopamine and norepinephrine voltammograms.
