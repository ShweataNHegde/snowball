<p>In vivo measurements were obtained in a rodent model of medial forebrain bundle stimulation and simul- taneous FSCV recording in the dorsal striatum as described previously [
 <xref rid="pone.0254594.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Rats were sedated prior to surgery with intraperitoneal urethane (1.5 g/kg in a 0.26 g/mL saline solution, Millipore Sigma, Burling- ton, MA). Analgesia was maintained for rodents with intramuscular buprenorphine (0.06 mg/kg). Both the stimulation electrode and CFM were stereotactically inserted (KOPF instruments, Tujunga, CA). A scalp incision (1.5–2.0 cm) was made to expose the skull, and three trephine burr holes (approximately 3 mm in diameter) were drilled to allow implantation of the stimulating, neurochemical sensing, and reference electrodes. Dopamine release was evoked with a series 2 s stimulations using a range of amplitudes from 0.05–2.0 mA and pulsewidths from 0.8 and 1.8 ms, presented in a randomized order such that effects of hysteresis are minimized. Analyte measurements were obtained by sweeping the CFM potential from a resting potential of -0.4 V to a switching potential of 1.5 V and back to the resting potential, at a rate of 400 V/s every 100ms.
