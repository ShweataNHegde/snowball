  <p>a) Background subtracted voltammogram of a dopamine signal taken from a rat during DBS of the medial forebrain bundle (0.14mA, 1.43ms pulse width, 180 pulses, 90Hz), superimposed with squares showing the curvature boundaries for the voltammogram. Charge in the shaded region is likely the result of background current drift. Stimulation amplitude and pulse widths ranging from 0.14–0.16ms and 1.37–1.57ms, respectively, were systematically applied in a random order to minimize effects of hysteresis. All stimulation epochs consisted of 180 pulses delivered at 90Hz b) True and curvature boundaries obtained from background subtracted voltammograms of the entire rat DBS dataset with random combinations stimulation.</p>
