<p>â€¢ The responses in Figure 3 display varying degrees of linearity (none of them highly linear). Please discuss the consequences of this given that linear regression of these responses is used to convert between charge and concentration for unknown samples. Does the degree of linearity for the various methods adjust the determination of which method is best suited for use?</p>
