<p>3. The authors have presented this work as an automatic quantification approach however, the manuscript is missing details on how theses boundary conditions were implemented into an automatized system. Authors should support the concept with a schematic flowchart/algorithm of the applied “routines”. The flowchart should provide an overview of the applied computational procedure for filtering/smoothing and background- subtractions in addition to the correction routines (page 5, 2.3).</p>
