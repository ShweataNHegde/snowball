<p>• The authors state that “A region of positive, nearly constant current between 1 and 1.5 volts that persists far into the cathodic sweep is likely the consequence of background drift.” Is there evidence to support that claim? If the feature is drift, why does that drift not occur prior to the oxidation peak (-0.4 V to 0.3 V)?</p>
