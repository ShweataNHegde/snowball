<p>â€¢ How does the curvature method perform when dealing with small in vivo oxidation peaks resulting from FSCAV basal detection or brief DBS stimulation? The authors state that the desired use for is for this methodology is to provide cutoff limits for in vivo FSCAV experiments. This study should show the applicability of the methodology using FSCAV data.</p>
