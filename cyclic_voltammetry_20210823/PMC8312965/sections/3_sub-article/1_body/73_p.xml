<p>• The authors state that there cannot be a “True Limit” for the reduction peak. They previously stated that the switching potential could serve as a limit for the “True” method in cases where the peak does not return to zero (i.e. in vivo data). Wouldn’t this justification be applicable here as well and allow for inclusion of the “True” data set into Figure 7?</p>
