<p>Recently, the Ross group has shown the codetection of adenosine and guanosine with FSCV by utilizing a “scalene”-shaped waveform to increase the oxidative peak separation between guanosine and adenosine.

 </sup> Despite the significantly improved resolution between guanosine and adenosine as compared with that of the conventional triangle waveform, the simultaneous detection of polymerized nucleobases within DNA or RNA has not yet been explored. Moreover, cytosine (a pyrimidine), in particular, has a relatively higher oxidation potential and slower electron-transfer kinetics compared with purine bases, guanine and adenine.
