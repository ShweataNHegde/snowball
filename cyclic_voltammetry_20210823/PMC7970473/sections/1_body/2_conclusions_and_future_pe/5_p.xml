<p>Specifically, future work could investigate whether classes of pathogens have distinct elevated signatures of nucleic acids, whether protein or lipid viral coats interfere with the detection using FSCV, and to characterize the release of nucleic acids by the host cells. Another future direction would be a test with FSCV to detect structurally oxidized nucleobases such as 8-oxo-guanine, which correlates with cancer and diabetes in humans.

 </sup> Given that crime-scene forensics may require the detection of blood or other nucleic acid-bearing fluids, the development of a fast, portable, biocompatible, and robust CFME biosensor for DNA/RNA with a high spatial and temporal resolution may have long-lasting impacts beyond the laboratory or clinic.
