<p>Having shown that free nucleosides can be codetected using the 150–400 scalene waveform, we tested whether the synthetic ssDNA is a suitable substrate for the codetection of the three nucleobases. For this experiment, we tested 10-bp synthetic poly-AAT or poly-GGT (to avoid G-quadruplex) sequences. While the position of each potential remains unchanged, there is a significant difference in the oxidative current relative to free nucleosides (

 </xref>B). This can likely be attributed to the negatively charged sugar–phosphate backbone of the ssDNA that is electrostatically repelled from the carbon surface and may affect the kinetics of adsorption and/or desorption to the electrode surface.
