<p>The oxidation of adenosine and guanosine occurs at the purine nucleobase moieties, adenine and guanine. Among the three nitrogenous bases, guanosine yields the highest peak oxidative current because guanine is the most electrochemically active base. Guanosine’s oxidation involves two-step oxidation processes with transferring four electrons and four protons. The first step oxidizes guanosine to 8-oxoguanosine (

 </sup> The corresponding oxidation peaks can be found at 1.15 V for the primary peak and at 0.65 V for the secondary peak, respectively (both on the forward scan) as shown in the literature.

 </sup> Meanwhile, adenosine’s molecular oxidation involves three oxidation steps with total exchanges of six electrons and six protons, yielding a dicarbonium ion as an intermediate (

Cytidine undergoes a reversible one-step oxidation with a transfer of two electrons and two protons (
