<p>The isolation of RNA was performed with Zymo Research DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus kit (Cat# D7003). The nematodes were cultured on standard nematode growth media plates at room temperature for 1 week. The worms were washed off the plates in M9 buffer and centrifuged at 400
 <italic>g</italic> for 1 min, followed by aspiration to form a high-density pellet. An equal volume of DNA/RNA shield buffer (from the Zymo DNA/RNA Miniprep Kit) was added to the pellet and it was rapidly frozen at −80 °C. To extract RNA from 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the frozen aliquot worms were thawed and transferred to ZR Bashing Bead Lysis Tubes (Cat# S6012). They were then vortexed for 5 min, followed by a 1 min rest and another vortexing for 5 min. Then, 30 μL of proteinase K buffer and 15 μL of Proteinase K were added to each tube, which was incubated for 30 min at 55 °C. The rest of the protocol was performed as per the manufacturer’s instructions to yield purified RNA for the procedure.
