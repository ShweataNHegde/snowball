<p>We constructed a high-copy plasmid (B9) by ligating a segment of the prp-8 gene from the nematode 
 <italic>Halicephalobus mephisto</italic>(
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">62</xref>) into the RNAi vector L4440.

 </sup> Specifically, single colony of B9-carrying 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> was inoculated into two flasks using a sterile loop and then grown in 75 mL of LB culture media supplemented with 50 μg/mL ampicillin at 37 °C for 24 h with gentle shaking. The plasmid was then extracted from these bacteria using ZymoPure II Plasmid Maxiprep kit (Cat# D4202) according to the manufacturer’s protocols (one set of columns can process 150 mL of bacterial culture), followed by elution using 400 μL of DI rather than ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, which could cause a background signal in FSCV. The obtained plasmid DNA was subsequently diluted in the range of 1–10 μM using PBS buffer in a centrifuge tube. The denatured form of the plasmid DNA was obtained by putting it in boiling water for 5 min and then letting it cool down in an ice bath for 2 min.
