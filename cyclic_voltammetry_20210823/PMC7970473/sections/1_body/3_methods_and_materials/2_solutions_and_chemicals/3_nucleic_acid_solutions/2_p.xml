<p>The synthesized ssDNAs with different sizes (10- and 20-mer) were obtained from Integrated DNA Technology (IDT) in an anhydrate form. The sequences of 10-mer and 20-mer of Poly-GGT ssDNA are 5′-GGTGGTGGTGGT ......GG-3′, where the recurrent thymidine prevents the G oligonucleotide from folding and then forming a quadruplex. Similar sequences of 10-mer and 20-mer of Poly-A oligonucleotide (10 bp poly-AAT ssDNA, 20 bp poly-AAT ssDNA) and 10 bases of Poly-CCT ssDNA (10 bp poly-CCT ssDNA) with thymidine were also obtained from IDT. The DNA strands were dissolved as a stock solution in nuclease-free water (nondiethyl pyrocarbonate treated) from Thermo Fischer Scientific (Life Technologies Corp., Austin, TX). Diluted solutions in the range of 1–100 μM were prepared as needed with PBS buffer solutions. Single-stranded oligonucleotide having sequences of 5′-AGTAGTAGTAGTAG-3′ was annealed with its complementary 5′-CTACTACTACTACT-3′ sequence. This was accomplished by mixing them at equimolar concentrations and then heating the mixture on a hot plate (95 °C) for 5 min. After this the hot plate was switched off, allowing the mixture to slowly cool to room temperature (approximately 90 min). When we performed the detection experiment, we used boiling to reseparate the strands as discussed in the text.</p>
