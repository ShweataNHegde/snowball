<p>The cyclic voltammograms were obtained using the WaveNeuro FSCV System with 5 MΩ headstage (Pine Instruments). For data collection and analysis, the software high-definition cyclic voltammetry with the PC1e-6363 multifunction I/O device (National Instruments, Austin, TX) was used. Upon testing the electrodes, a triangle waveform was applied with a holding potential of −0.4 to 1.45 V against the silver–silver chloride reference electrode (Ag/AgCl, −0.197 V) and back at a scan rate of 400 V/s with a frequency of 10 Hz. However, for the scalene waveform, a potential in the range of −0.4 −1.45 V against the silver–silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) reference electrode was applied and back at a forward scan rate of 150 V/s and a backward scan rate of 400 V/s with a frequency of 10 Hz. Each electrode was back-filled with 0.1 M KCl solution to create an electrical connection and was allowed to equilibrate with the applied waveform for 10 min. Samples were tested in a flow injection analysis system (In Vitro/FSCV Microelectrode Flow Cell with xyz micromanipulator Translational Stage, Pine Instruments, Durham, NC). The buffer and samples were pumped through the flow cell at 1 mL/min using the NE-300 Just Infusion Syringe Pump (New Era Pump Systems, Farmingdale, NY). All data were background-subtracted to remove any non-Faradaic currents by averaging 10 CVs.</p>
