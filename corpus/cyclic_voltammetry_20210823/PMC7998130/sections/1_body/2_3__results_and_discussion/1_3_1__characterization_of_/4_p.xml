<p>The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of the silver nanowire membranes before and after CV treatment are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00672-f001">Figure 1</xref>f. The peak positions of silver did not change significantly (â‰¤0.05 eV) after CV treatment, indicating that the chemical state of silver on the substrate did not change after the CV treatment.
