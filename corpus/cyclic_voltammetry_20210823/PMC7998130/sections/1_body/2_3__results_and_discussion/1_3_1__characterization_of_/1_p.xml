<p>Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) were employed to characterize the structure and morphology of silver nanowires and their membranes. The SEM images of the untreated silver nanowire membrane at different magnifications are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00672-f001">Figure 1</xref>c,d. As-prepared silver nanowires were observed to have a smooth surface, a length of few microns to tens of microns, and a relatively uniform diameter of â‰ˆ60 nm, which was also confirmed by the TEM images (
