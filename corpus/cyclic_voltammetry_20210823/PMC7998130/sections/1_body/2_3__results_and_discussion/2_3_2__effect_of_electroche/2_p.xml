<p>The SEM images of the silver nanowire membrane subjected to different CV cycles (20 Â°C) are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00672-f002">Figure 2</xref>. It is clear that with an increase in the cycle number, the silver nanowires turned into small nanoparticles and nanorods. Nanoparticles and nanorods appeared on the substrate when the cycle number was 5, and the number of nanoparticles and nanorods increased up to the cycle number of 15. However, with a further increase in the cycle number, the number of nanoparticles and nanorods ceased to increase, and the sizes of nanoparticles and nanorods increased instead. In the first 15 cycles, the silver atoms being electrolyzed mainly originated from silver nanowires in the oxidation step, and the released silver ions recrystallized to form silver nanoparticles and nanorods. With a further increase in the number of CV cycles, the silver ions first deposited on the surface of the pre-existing silver nanoparticles and silver nanorods owing to the high nucleation energy barrier for the formation of new nanoparticles. It should be noted that appropriately sized silver nanoparticles and silver nanorods will produce a strong SPR in the visible region, especially when they form nanoscale gaps among one another. As abundant silver nanoparticles and nanorods partially substitute the silver nanowires on the surface of the membrane, a significant increase in the density of hotspots and the SERS performance of the silver nanowire membrane are expected.
