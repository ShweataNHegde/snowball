<p>As the SPR depends strongly on the shape and size of the plasmonic nanostructure, diffuse reflection spectroscopy was performed to analyze the SPR of substrates and to characterize the change in the surface nanostructures after CV treatment. The diffuse reflection spectra of the silver nanowire membranes are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00672-f003">Figure 3</xref>a (after different CV cycles) and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00672-f003">Figure 3</xref>c (CV performed at different temperatures). Differences in the absorption between the untreated and treated substrates basically represent the light absorption by the newly generated nanostructures after CV treatment. Substrates prepared under different conditions may have different surface morphologies. In order to achieve a sharper contrast between the spectra of treated and untreated samples, a series of spectra were obtained by subtracting the absorption spectra of the treated substrates with that of the untreated one. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00672-f003">Figure 3</xref>b,d, the absorption band between 400 and 500 nm may be attributed to the characteristic absorption of silver nanoparticles. The absorption band ranging from 600 to 1000 nm might arise from the long-axis absorption of silver nanorods. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00672-f003">Figure 3</xref> indicates that the substrate has a comparatively high SPR absorbance between 400 and 500 nm when the CV cycle number is 15 and the temperature is 20 °C. Combined with the results of SEM images shown before (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-11-00672">Figure S5c</xref>), the optimum conditions for treating the substrates were deemed to be 15 CV cycles at 20 °C.
