<p>Tetramethylthiuram disulfide (thiram) is a highly efficient and low-toxic pesticide, which is widely used in the prevention and control of crop diseases. However, the excessive residues of thiram in the crops will pose a serious threat to human health, and therefore, the detection of thiram is very important [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00672-f006">Figure 6</xref>b shows the SERS spectra of thiram in different concentrations on the electrochemically treated silver nanowire film. The illustration is of the molecular structure of thiram. The characteristic peaks of thiram are 439, 563, 928, 1149, 1229, 1392, and 1510 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. Among them, the peak at 563 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> is owing to the stretching vibration of the S-S bond; the peak at 928 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> is attributed to the stretching vibration of CH
 <sub>3</sub>N; the peak at 1149 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> arises from the stretching vibration of the C–N bond and CH
 <sub>3</sub> plane; peaks at 1382 and 1510 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> originate from the C–N stretching vibration and CH
 <sub>3</sub> deformation vibration [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00672-f006">Figure 6</xref>b, the characteristic peak intensity of thiram increases with the increasing of its concentration. In addition, the linear equation was displayed in

 <sup>−11</sup> M.
