<p>Crystal violet is an alkaline triphenylmethane disinfectant that has a significant bactericidal effect, especially against fungal infections and parasitic diseases in fish [
 <xref rid="B44-nanomaterials-11-00672" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The results of recent studies show that crystal violet can be metabolized into fat-soluble stealth crystal violet through biotransformation after entering the fish body and has potential side effects such as carcinogenesis and mutagenesis [
 <xref rid="B45-nanomaterials-11-00672" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Therefore, it is significant to detect the residue of crystal violet in cultured water. Since the crystal violet molecules are easily adsorbed on the silver surface, the substrates were immersed in 10
 <sup>−5</sup> M to 10
 <sup>−10</sup> M crystal violet aqueous solutions, and their corresponding SERS spectra were recorded. The 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00672-f006">Figure 6</xref>a shows the SERS spectrum of crystal violet with different concentrations on the surface of the silver nanowire membrane treated by CV and the illustration is of the molecular structure. The conventional Raman spectrum of crystal violet is exhibited in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-11-00672">Figure S10b</xref> for comparison. The characteristic peaks of crystal violet are 425, 527, 726, 801, 915, 1175, 1392, and 1618 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. Among them, the peak at 421 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> is attributed to benzene–C–benzene out-of-plane deformation vibration; peaks at 527 and 915 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> are owing to the aromatic ring skeleton vibration; the peaks at 726 and 1175 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> originate from the radial plane aromatic ring carbon–hydrogen bond bending vibration; the peaks at 1618 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> arise from C–C in-plane stretching vibration [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00672-f006">Figure 6</xref>a that the characteristic peak intensity of crystal violet gradually increases with an increase in its concentration, and the linear equation was given in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-11-00672">Figure S9a</xref> within the range of 10
 <sup>−10</sup>–10
 <sup>−8</sup> M, and the LOD of the crystal violet concentration was found to be 5.1 × 10
 <sup>−11</sup> M.
