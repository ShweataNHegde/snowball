<p>The homogeneity of the SERS substrate was investigated by sampling in five locations and intensity mapping. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-11-00672">Figure S7</xref>, the RSD of sample points was calculated to be 4.0%, which conveys that the substrate exhibits a good homogeneity on a larger scale. It is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-11-00672">Figure S8</xref> that the substrate is still relatively uniform on the micron scale.
