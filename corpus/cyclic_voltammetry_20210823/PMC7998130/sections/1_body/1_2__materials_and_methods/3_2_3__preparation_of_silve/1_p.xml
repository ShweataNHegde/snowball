<p>Silver nanowires were synthesized by a water-modulated solvothermal polyol process [
 <xref rid="B33-nanomaterials-11-00672" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Typically, 3.52 g of PVP-K30 was added to 116 mL glycerol in a 250 mL round-bottom flask and stirred gently at 85 °C until the solid dissolved completely. Then, silver nitrate (0.868 g) was added to the solution after cooling it to room temperature. Subsequently, a glycerol solution (4 mL) containing 35.4 mg of sodium chloride and 0.15 mL of water was added to the solution. Then, the flask was immersed in an oil bath and stirred with a polytetrafluoroethylene magneton. Then, the solution was heated to 210 °C for 20 min. Once the temperature of the solution reached 210 °C, the solution was allowed to cool spontaneously to room temperature. Then, 120 mL of water was added to the flask with gentle stirring, and the product was allowed to precipitate over 48 h. Thereafter, the precipitate was collected and washed thrice with water. The as-obtained silver nanowires were finally dispersed in 100 mL of ethanol.
