<p>As novel flexible substrates, membranes of silver nanowires have attracted increasing attention because silver nanowires with a certain aspect ratio can be easily loaded onto a filter membrane to generate a flexible SERS substrate without complex fabrication processes [

Therefore, SERS hot spots exist in a minority of regions of the silver nanowire membrane, and there is still a big potential to obtain a higher density of hotspots in the membrane. Although silver nanowire membranes have been used in many fields for chemical analysis, the low density of SERS hot spots still impedes their widespread applications. There have been numerous research studies to increase the density of SERS hot spots on silver nanowires, including the fabrication of gold nanoparticle/silver nanowire heterostructures, and the conversion of disordered silver nanowires into ordered ones at the oil–water–air interface [
