 <p>The development of high-quality flexible surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) substrates is crucial for developing rapid SERS analysis in situ. Silver nanowire membranes as novel flexible substrates could benefit from the high collection efficiency of analytes by wrapping complex surfaces or wiping the surfaces of samples. However, their low SERS performance impedes further applications of silver nanowire membranes in analyte detection. Herein, we report an ultra-high-sensitivity silver nanowire membrane synthesized by a simple and time-saving cyclic voltammetry (CV) method. After CV treatment, a part of the silver nanowires on the silver nanowire membrane turned into small nanoparticles and nanorods. This nanostructure’s reconstitution increased the analytical enhancement factor of silver nanowire membranes by 14.4 times. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were employed to investigate the transformation in the membrane nanostructure. The CV-treated substrates exhibited high surface-enhanced Raman activity and good temporal stability. The limits of detection (LODs) for

  <sup>−9</sup> M, 0.00693 ng, 0.0810 ng, and 0.0273 ng on this substrate, respectively. Additionally, the developed substrate is feasible for the detection of crystal violet in real samples. These results certify that CV-treated substrates possess broad application prospects in on-site SERS analysis.
