<p>Here, we propose novel methods to quantify charge from REDOX reactions observed in voltammetric measurements electroactive neurochemicals. While our proposed methods were applied to a dataset collected with a traditional FSCV waveform, this approach can be generalized to other voltammetric waveforms reliant on charge quantification, including FSCAV. However, additional studies must be completed to characterize behavior of our approach with novel voltammetric waveforms. Although a definitive selection of integration boundaries is confounded by interferents, background drift, low signal to noise ratio, and other effects, data shown here suggest that our quantification methods are comparable to competing methods for quantification of dopamine oxidation charge, and may more closely approximate true charge when applied to other catecholamines. Additionally, unlike existing charge quantification techniques, our methods can quantify reduction reactions as well as single oxidation or reduction peaks when multiple analytes are present in a sample. Here, charge analysis has been performed automatically, improving reproducibility and demonstrating the feasibility of developing automated routines for charge quantification of multiple analytes.</p>
