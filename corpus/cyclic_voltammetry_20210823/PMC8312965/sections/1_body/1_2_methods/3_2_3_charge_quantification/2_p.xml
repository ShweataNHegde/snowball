<p>FSCAV limits (

 <xref rid="pone.0254594.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Note that all measurements were collected using a traditional FSCV waveform described in section 2.2 as opposed to FSCAV. Inflection limits are defined as the zeros of the second derivative of a voltammogram, around an oxidation (or reduction) peak, and curvature points (maximum curvature, or maximum second derivative) are defined as the maxima/minima of the second derivative around an oxidation/reduction peak, see
