<p>â€¢ How does the sensitivity for target (DA) detection in the presence of interferent compare to the sensitivity for target alone using the various methods? This is critical to assessing the selectivity of the technique. Please provide the linear calibration data for DA in the presence of interferent (Figure 8a) and compare to response with DA alone.</p>
