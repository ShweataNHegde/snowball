<p>• It is notable that the DA, NEP and EPI experiments in Figures 2, 3 and 4 reflect different experimental designs. Why was NEP and EPI tested up to 5 µM whereas DA was only tested to 1 µM? Why were there so few replicates for NEP and EPI as compared to DA? If the authors intend to provide a fair comparison between the responses of various chemicals then the experimental protocols should mimic each other.</p>
