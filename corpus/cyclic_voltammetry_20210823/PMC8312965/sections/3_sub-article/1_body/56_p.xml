<p>â€¢ Are the results detailed in Figure 6b meant to state that the increase in the charge is due to an increase in the extracellular concentration of the in vivo chemical (I assume the chemical is dopamine but the authors never state the identity of the in vivo signal) or is this a consequence of the duty cycle artifact on integration limits? In addition, the authors neglect discussing how the data seem to group by stimulation current as well. Please substantially revise and clarify this discussion.</p>
