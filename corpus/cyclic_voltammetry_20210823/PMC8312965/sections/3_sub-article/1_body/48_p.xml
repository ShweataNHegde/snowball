<p>Reviewer #1:Â This study discusses the development of a novel methodology for selecting integration limits for the purpose of quantifying the concentration of electrochemical targets using FSCV. This technology advancement could serve as a critical improvement to the in vivo basal detection method FSCAV by replacing user-defined integration limits with algorithm-defined cutoffs. This would have the desired effect of removing the possibility for user bias from FSCAV data analysis. This study is highly relevant but requires substantial revision prior to publication.</p>
