<p>Reviewer #2: This paper presents a novel approach to identify neurochemicals and a clever effort to reduce false observations in FSCV or FSCAV data. Given that most of voltammetric post-analysis methods are prone to misinterpretation, a more mathematical approach – like the one presented in this work – can contribute to making more accurate statements on the collected biological data. It would be interesting to see how this work would develop in future.</p>
