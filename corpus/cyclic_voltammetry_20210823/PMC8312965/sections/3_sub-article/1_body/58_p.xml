<p>â€¢ The 2nd EPI peak in Figure 8b has clearly not resolved by the switching potential. Cutting at the switching potential does not seem appropriate for obtaining an accurate quantification of the 2nd peak. Is this technique only applicable for targets where the peaks are allowed to totally resolve prior to the switching potential?</p>
