<p>On the other hand, the metallic ion used in MOF synthesis has evolved over time and crystals have been made with different metals such as Cu, Rh, Ru, Mo, Cr, Fe, W, Zn, Cu, Mn, Zr, and Co. However, according to the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD), cobalt is the least used element (1%) in the synthesis of MOF (Wang, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). However, cobalt in the metallic center of the MOF could contribute with different properties like a high reactivity through the oxygen interaction with the ligands (Betteridge, 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">1980</xref>), allowing many possibilities of application, such as in magnetic and supercapacitors field. This manner, synthesis of MOF with cobalt represents a theme of great interest in the scientific community.
