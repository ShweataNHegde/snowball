<p>MOF have been of great interest due to the wide amount of applications, for instance, catalysis (Shen et al., 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), magnetism (Tian et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), luminescence (Allendorf et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), gas detection (Drobek et al., 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), water purification (Ma et al., 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), gas storage (Li and Yang, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), adsorption properties (Kaur et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), and supercapacitors (Lee et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The latter is another great advantage of MOF, since the structural flexibility vs. external stimuli (changes in temperature and pressure), that varies their porosity. For this reason, it is possible to promote their use as molecular sieves (Bux et al., 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and drug-releasing capsules (Orellana-Tavra et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), among other things. This versatility in their application is due to the properties such as the high specific surface area of &gt;1,000 m2/g, a regular and adjustable pore texture, flexibility in surface chemistry, and high chemical and thermal stability (Xia, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).
