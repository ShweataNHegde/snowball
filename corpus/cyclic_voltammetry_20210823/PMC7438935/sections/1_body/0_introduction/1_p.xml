<p>Since ancient times, a variety of porous materials have been used, for instance: cell membranes, porous polymers, and some natural materials such as rocks, foams and soils (clays), which are classified as low- or medium-porosity materials (Zdravkov et al., 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Nowadays, there are materials with excellent microstructural characteristics (high porosity), such as MOF (metalâ€“organic frameworks); which are crystalline materials with high porosity, belonging to hybrid-material classification, due to the presence of chemical bonds between metal and ligand ions (Zhou et al., 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), constituting coordination links and the ability to grow in different dimensions such as 2D and 3D (Wang et al.,
