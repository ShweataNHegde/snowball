<p>In this work the MOF UV-11 synthesis through a solvothermal technique using cobalt metal ions was carried out, as well as the analytical characterization using electrochemical voltammetry to elude the pathways of the redox electron transfer process, while the faradaic reaction occurs. In particular, because this type of reaction is used to design and build sensors. So, the voltammetry is useful in elucidating mechanisms and estimate thermodynamic, kinetic and electrochemical performance properties.</p>
