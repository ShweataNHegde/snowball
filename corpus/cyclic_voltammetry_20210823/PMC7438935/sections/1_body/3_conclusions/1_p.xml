<p>The porous coordination polymer obtained using a solvothermal method with a cobalt metal centre (MOF UV-11) presents a melting point in an interval of 292–293°C, which is greater than that of its precursors. Pink crystals (~173 μm in length and 40 μm in width) with a laminar morphology demonstrated the presence of elements such as cobalt, carbon and oxygen. The XRD analysis corroborated the existence of cobalt phase peaks (PDF-00-054-2464) as cobalt bis (pyridine-6-carboxylic-2-carboxylate) supporting the obtaining of MOF UV-11, whose evaluation has not been reported in the literature.</p>
