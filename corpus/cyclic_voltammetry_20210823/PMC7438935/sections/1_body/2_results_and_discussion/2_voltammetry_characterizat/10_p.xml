<p>To obtain the values of the electrochemical parameters the parameterisation of Equation (1) is considered, and broken down in Equation (2); furthermore, each parameter is expressed in Ec. 3–5. Ec. 6 shows the dependence of the current on the scanning rate in terms of the average superficial reaction of the electrode ip. The extension of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref> shows the linear dependence on the value of the anodic peak (I
 <sub>OX</sub>) and the cathode (I
 <sub>RED)</sub> potential value to the scan rate logarithm. The function describes that the behavior of the anodic peak potential is Ep = 0.663–0.033 V (5.411 + log v), with a linear correlation of 0.9643 of the data. Meanwhile, for the potential of the cathode peak at Ep = 0.830–0.0498 V (6.54 × 10
 <sup>−6</sup> + log v), there is a linear correlation of 0.9999, which may indicate that there are diffusion mechanisms in the electrode.
