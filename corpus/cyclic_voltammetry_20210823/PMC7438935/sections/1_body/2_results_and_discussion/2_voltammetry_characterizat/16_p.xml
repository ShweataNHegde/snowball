 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref> shows the cyclic voltammogram repeating the potential scan program 20 times (cycles 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 are shown). It is observed that the peak current is increased logarithmically according to the number of cycles, with a coefficient correlation of 0.9865 and 0.9964 for anodic and cathodic peaks, respectively. However, from the last three cycles, significant changes are not observed; which may be attributable to MOF crystalline framework activation over the electrode and could be associated with improved conductivity and decreased interface capacitance of the electrode on its surface.
