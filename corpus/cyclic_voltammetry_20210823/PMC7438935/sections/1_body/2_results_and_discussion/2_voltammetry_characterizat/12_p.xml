<p>Therefore, the described processes do not depend on the linear diffusion of the electrolyte to the electrode, but the electroactive species is on the electrode and the process is governed by the rapid transfer species into the same electrode, considering that the higher scanning rate presents a transfer increase of two to three electrons.</p>
