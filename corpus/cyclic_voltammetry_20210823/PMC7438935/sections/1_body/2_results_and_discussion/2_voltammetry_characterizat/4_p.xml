<p>In addition, it is important to mention that due to the evaluated potential range, it is not possible to observe the corresponding redox processes of the 1,2-di-(4-piridil) ligand, as these are presented at high reduction potential values (Peroff et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). This functional group is only an electrical conductor that allows the conduction between the carboxylic and metallic centre groups.
