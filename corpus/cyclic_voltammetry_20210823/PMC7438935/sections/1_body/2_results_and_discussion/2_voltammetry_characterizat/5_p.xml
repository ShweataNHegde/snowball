<p>Likewise, the associated processes with oxidation and reduction of Co
 <sup>2+</sup> and Co
 <sup>3+</sup> are not observed. According to Matheus et al., oxidation is present in a range from 0 to 0.5 V, with a reduction of 0.12 V (Matheus et al., 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), which is due to the coordination that cobalt presents with the ligands. However, the coordination orbitals of Cobalt allow the storage of the charge received by the carbonyl group. The electron can be stored and subsequently released, by oxidation and reduction of the metal centre that is bound to the ligands.
