<p>On the other hand, the MCPE response shows an oxidation peak (I
 <sub>OX</sub>) with 0.730 V of potential, attributable to the oxidation of the acid organic linking 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylic present in MOF UV-11, which matches the oxidation potential range reported in the literature (Talbi et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>) which describes the different modifications in the carboxylic groups induced by electrochemical oxidation, continuing with the potential scan in the anodic-direction process corresponding to the oxygen evolution. Reversing the potential scan to cathodic direction a peak reduction (I
 <sub>RED</sub>) in 0.670 V can be seen, which is attributed to the carbonyl group reduction of the organic ligand present in the structure of the MOF (RCOO
 <sup>−</sup> ↔ RCOO
 <sup>•</sup>).
