<p>The crystals shown have different sizes and thicknesses, attributed to the solvothermal production method. In contrast to other techniques such as the mechanochemical, the smaller crystal dimensions are due to the interaction between mechanical elements and produce results presenting a decrease in magnitudes. The melting point of 1,2-di-(4-pyridyl)-ethylene is in the range of 148–152°C. Moreover, the 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylic acid is in the range of 281–284°C and Co(NO
 <sub>3</sub>)2-6H
 <sub>2</sub>O does not exceed 56°C.
