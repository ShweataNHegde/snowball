<p>To corroborate the correct synthesis of the MOF UV-11, a melting point was evaluated, which is different from that of the precursors; being assumed the presence of greater stability in comparison of the precursors, because its high melting point and crystalline structure. On the other hand, the results of Z potential indicate that all over the range of pH evaluated, there is not significant variability, presenting an average ofâˆ’10 mV; this implies that the MOF is stable in the range evaluated because of the lack of interaction with the electrolyte. This is consistent with the MOF's prime requirements showing structural stability to changes in the pH values (Howarth et al., 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). These values are attributable to the molecule structure that has functional groups such as carbonyls and aromatic groups, which cause the polar molecule behavior and do not present repulsion toward the molecules in the electrode interface. Also, at this range of pH, the carbonic groups have their acid constant pK
 <sub>a</sub> uniform.
