<p>On the other hand, MOF UV-11 shows microscopic properties such as a rectangular form of the crystal with dimensions of approximately 173 μm in length and 40 μm in width, with a contact surface area of 6932 m
 <sup>2</sup>. In addition, the EDS analysis corroborated that the MOF crystal (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>) contains the precursor elements. These components are joined in the metal–organic framework, constituting a mass ratio proportion of 55.9%
 <sub>w/w</sub> of carbon, 28.4%
 <sub>w/w</sub> of oxygen, and 15.8%
 <sub>w/w</sub> of cobalt and according to the simulation shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. The structure and the coordination form have a triclinic crystalline system and an unit cell of 1922 Å volume.
