<p>The carbon paste electrode represents one of the most convenient materials for modified electrodes preparation, due to their high homogenization capacity, their easy preparation and modification by different methods (Kalcher, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>; Taylor et al., 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The Carbon Paste Electrodes (CPEs) were prepared using graphite powder with a particle size of &lt;20 microns and Nujol oil as a binder, both of which are produced by Sigma-Aldrich. A 2:1 ratio of graphite and binder was utilized. For the preparation of Modified Carbon Paste Electrodes (MCPEs), the same proportion as the CPEs was used, but 3%
 <sub>w/w</sub> of MOF UV-11 was incorporated.
