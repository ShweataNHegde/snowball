<p>For MOF UV-11 synthesis, all the used analytical grade reagents were provided by Sigma-Aldrich. The precursors were weighed in a RADWAG XA220 analytical balance, firstly, 0.2743 mmol of 1,2-di-(4-pyridyl)-ethylene, 0.5486 mmol of Co(NO
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>-6H
 <sub>2</sub>O, and 0.2743 mmol of 1,2,4,5- benzenetetracarboxylic; subsequently, they were dissolved in 5 ml of Dimethyl Formamide (DMF). In addition, the resulting solution was placed in stainless steel-coated Teflon reactors, being heated inside of a muffle furnace at 90Â°C for 72 h. Then, all of the reactors were cooled to room temperature and a filtering process was carried out, whereby obtaining the MOF crystals. Finally, MOF UV-11 activation was performed in agitation for 30 min in ethanol. The activation of the MOF is necessary so that it can have a permanent pore size thus avoiding host molecules, this without affecting the structural capacity (Mondloch et al.,
