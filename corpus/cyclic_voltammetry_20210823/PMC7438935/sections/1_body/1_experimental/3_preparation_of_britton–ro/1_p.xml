<p>For the preparation of the supporting electrolyte, a buffer solution called Britton–Robinson was used, which is also known as “universal buffer,” due to the wide pH damping range between 2 and 12. Acid H
 <sub>3</sub>BO
 <sub>4</sub> 0.01 M, phosphoric acid H
 <sub>3</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub> 0.01 M, and acetic acid CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH 0.01 M were utilized at a ratio of 1:1:1, respectively; all of which were of the J.T. Baker brand with 99.5% purity. The pH dissolution was adjusted to 7 with a solution comprising sodium hydroxide 0.01 M; this solution was made using Reasol brand reagent 0.01 M with 97% purity. NaCl 0.001 M was added to the obtained supporting electrolyte, this solution was made using Sigma-Aldrich with 99% purity and deionized water.
