<p>Electrochemical analysis was conducted on an Autolab PGSTAT30 Potentiostat-Galvanostat with NOVA 2.0 software, using a typical three-electrode array. A saturated calomel electrode was used as reference electrode, a platinum bar as counter electrode, and CPEs and MCPEs as the working electrodes. Cyclic voltammetry scan started with a zero current potential of E
 <sub>i</sub> = 0 and in an anodic direction, at three different potential scanning rates: 25, 50, and 100 mVs
 <sup>âˆ’1</sup>. In addition, the inversion potential evaluation was undertaken from 750 mV (every 50 mV) until reaching the maximum limit of 1,200 mV.
