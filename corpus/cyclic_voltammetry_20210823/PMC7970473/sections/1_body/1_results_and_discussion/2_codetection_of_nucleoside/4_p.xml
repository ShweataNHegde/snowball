<p>For the multianalyte codetection, we noted that the oxidative peak of adenosine is masked by the oxidative peak of cytidine during the codetection of the three nucleobases (

It can be attributed to adenosine’s adsorption-controlled interaction with the carbon fiber electrode, which is typically slower than guanosine’s diffusion and partially adsorption-controlled interaction. In order to minimize the interfering effect of cytidine while maintaining its sensitivity, a molar ratio mixture of 1 cytidine to 20 adenosine and guanosine (1C:20A:20G) was used. The distinction between the oxidative peaks of adenine, cytosine, and guanine can be verified by a color plot, which shows the separation of each oxidation peak at different voltages (

 </xref>C,D. The simultaneous measurement CV of adenine, guanine, and cytosine was obtained from the vertical slice of this color plot at approximately 5.5 s. The false color plot is a representation of current versus voltage over time. The blue color represents the negative reduction current, while the green color represents the positive oxidation current, and yellow represents the background charging current as shown in the scale. There is less distinction between the primary peaks of cytosine, showing some coalescence with the secondary oxidative peak for guanine since it has a sensitivity of 0.06 nA/μM, which is 2 orders of magnitude lower than those of guanosine. The separation of the peaks indicates their difference in kinetic activity at the electrode cycling voltages.
