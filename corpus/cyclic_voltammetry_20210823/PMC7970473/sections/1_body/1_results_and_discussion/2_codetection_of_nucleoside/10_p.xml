<p>To evaluate the practical applicability of a CFME sensor, we used real biological samples: plasmid DNA (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>
 </xref>A), 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> RNA in buffer (5B), and rat serum (5C). For both plasmid DNA and 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> RNA, adenine and guanine were detected, displaying an increase in peak oxidative current with respect to their increasing concentrations. Adenine appeared to have a higher sensitivity than guanine at CFMEs, which is consistent with the aforementioned detection sensitivity of polymerized nucleobases. The current response of cytosine nucleobases was not within the limit of detection and was, therefore, not shown for this assay.
