<p>Having shown that polymerized nucleobases can be measured, we hypothesized that increasing the sequence length would hinder the sensitivity of nucleobases due to both size and charge characteristics. As can be seen in

 </xref>E,F, the longer molecules (20 bp poly-AAT and poly-GGT ssDNA) have approximately half the signal/sensitivity (current) observed from the shorter molecules (10 bp poly-AAT and poly-GGT ssDNA). The corresponding statistical analyses further demonstrate that both adenine (

 <italic>t</italic>-test) and guanine (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, 
 <italic>t</italic>-test) in longer (20 bp) ssDNA have a significantly decreased sensitivity compared to those in shorter (10 bp) ssDNA as shown in

 </xref>G,H. This lower sensitivity is presumably due to the limitation of the longer base pair DNA mobility, thus reducing the adsorption capacity and the resulting electrochemical activity at the surface of the electrode. Moreover, we hypothesized that the increased number of negatively charged phosphate groups in longer ssDNA increases the electrostatic repulsion at the surface of the carbon fiber electrode, specifically oxygen-containing groups at the edge plane of the graphitic lattice and from the negative holding potential.
