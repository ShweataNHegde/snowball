<p>During nucleoside codetection, guanosine displayed a higher sensitivity compared to adenosine (

 </xref>A,B). The concentration curve displays a linear relationship between the concentration of each purine and peak oxidative current between 1 and 20 μM. Although the overall sensitivity is lower compared to the single measurement of each analyte, guanosine (0.9 nA/μM) still has a higher sensitivity than adenosine (0.75 nA/μM) in their nucleoside mixture. However, the overall peak oxidation current of adenine is higher than that of guanine, as shown in

Moreover, we observe a linear relationship between the peak oxidative current and concentration between 1 and 20 μM (
