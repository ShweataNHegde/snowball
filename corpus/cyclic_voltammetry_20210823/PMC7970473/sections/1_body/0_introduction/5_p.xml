<p>In this study, we optimized a scalene waveform for FSCV testing with CFMEs coupled with DNA base ratios in a mixture to multiplex the detection of adenine, guanine, and cytosine applied to oligonucleotides, extracted plasmid DNA, and 
 <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> RNA. We demonstrate a higher sensitivity toward shorter and single-stranded oligonucleotide samples than longer and double-stranded oligonucleotides, respectively. Furthermore, we show that nucleobases can be detected in a complex rat serum sample in spite of interfering biological substances. This suggests that FSCV with CFMEs can be used in complex biological fluids to detect DNA or RNA, evaluating multiple nucleobase analytes, simultaneously.
