<p>Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) carries the genetic information needed to sustain life 
 <italic>via</italic> unique combinations of four different nucleobases (adenine, guanine, thymine, and cytosine) and has a double-stranded structure with its nucleobases shielded by the phosphate backbone groups.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
 </sup> Two of these nucleobases, adenine and guanine, are purines, with a double-ring structure. The other two, thymine and cytosine, are pyrimidines containing a single-ring structure.
