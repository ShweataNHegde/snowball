<p>This study paves the way for the multiplex detection of adenine, guanine, and cytosine at the modified scalene waveform. In this work, we used CFMEs with FSCV and a scalene waveform to codetect multiple nucleobases. We found that single-stranded molecules (whether DNA or RNA) have a higher sensitivity of detection than double-stranded molecules and that complex sample matrices (such as blood serum) do not preclude detection. Therefore, these results suggest that our method could eventually be useful in clinical settings such as detecting pathogens, particularly, single-stranded RNA or DNA viruses, within blood samples.</p>
