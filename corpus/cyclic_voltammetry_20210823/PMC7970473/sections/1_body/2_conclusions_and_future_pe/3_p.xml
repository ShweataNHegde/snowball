<p>Indeed, it has been shown that cell-free DNA and RNA are present at low levels in the blood of healthy humans and that the levels increase upon infection with certain pathogens.

 </sup> For example, difficult-to-diagnose fungal infections have been associated with elevated levels of cell-free circulating DNA.

 </sup> This could be important because fungal infections are often difficult or impossible to culture; they have a high fatality rate, and liquid biopsy of blood is a promising approach to quickly identify these cases.

 </sup> Our work with FSCV opens the tantalizing possibility to begin evaluating levels of cell-free DNA in clinical samples from healthy and infected patients to identify clinically useable signatures of infection types. More importantly, our work shows that the detection of nucleic acids is feasible in complex biological contexts like blood serum.
