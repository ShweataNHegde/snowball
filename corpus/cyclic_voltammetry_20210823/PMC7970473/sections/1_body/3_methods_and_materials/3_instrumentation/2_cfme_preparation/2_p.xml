 </sup> Briefly, a single strand carbon fiber of 7 μm in diameter was separated and aspirated into a glass capillary with a 1.2 mm outer and 0.68 mm inner diameter (A-M Systems, Sequim, WA) using a vacuum pump. Carbon fibers were pulled to form two electrodes on a vertical pipette puller (Narishige, model PC-100 and PE-22, Tokyo, Japan) and then cut to lengths of approximately 100–150 μm. To stabilize the carbon fiber inside the glass capillary and prevent leakage of backfilled saturated KCl solution, protruding CFME tips were dipped in the epoxy hardener mixture (Epon 828 epoxy) (Miller-Stephenson, Morton Grove, IL) and diethylenetriamine (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.8% by mass resin, for approximately 15 s and then rinsed in acetone to wash away any excess residual epoxy. The electrodes were cured in the oven for 4 h at 125 °C.
