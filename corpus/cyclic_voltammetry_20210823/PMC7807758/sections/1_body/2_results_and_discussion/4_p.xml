<p>The CPE model is superior to the conventional capacitor model used in the CV; hence, we assume that this model will also be useful in characterization of supercapacitors. To investigate the effect of the CPE model on a supercapacitor, the galvanostatic charge–discharge was applied. Charging is the core operation in a supercapacitor.

 </xref>B shows the galvanostatic charge–discharge curves for both the ideal capacitor and the CPE. The triangular response with the small iR drop was in good agreement with the predicted behavior of the ideal capacitor with a constant current, demonstrating the validity of our method in the galvanostatic mode. For the CPE, the response is not linear but instead appears to be curved. As distortion in CV depends on the 
 <italic>n</italic> value of the CPE, the smaller the 
 <italic>n</italic> is, the larger the curvature becomes. The initial region of CPEs shows a higher voltage than the ideal capacitor, demonstrating that the apparent capacitance of the CPE in this region is smaller than in the ideal case. In the extended charging region, however, the magnitude of apparent capacitance is reversed from the low values at the early stage, indicating lower efficiency as an energy storage device. These results are in good agreement with a previous report on the CPE based on the Laplace transform.

 </sup> Interestingly, the majority of papers on supercapacitors demonstrate CPE-like behavior in experiments, but the characterization of supercapacitors has been conducted based on an ideal capacitor model. Thus, both 
 <italic>Q</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> and 
 <italic>n</italic> are more reliable indicators than the traditional capacitance value when characterizing a supercapacitor. These two values do not represent the capacitance, but one can estimate the apparent capacitance, also referred to as the effective capacitance. Several models have been used to estimate the effective capacitance from the CPE in EIS corresponding to small perturbations.

 </sup> Unfortunately, we do not have any ideal method to identify the two different processes of either a hybrid supercapacitor or the CPE. Nonetheless, the suggested CPE model with our FT-based approach is a very promising model applicable to estimations and for explaining the behaviors of supercapacitors.
