<p>We investigated the charging current in the CV and galvanostatic charging/discharging behavior of the CPE, which has been used in only electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. To circumvent the frequency-dependent reactance of the CPE, the response for specific excitation is analyzed based on the harmonic wave at each frequency using the Fourier transform combined with Ohmâ€™s law. The response in the time domain is acquired by the inverse Fourier transform. Compared with CV based on a conventional simple capacitor model, the equivalent circuit with CPE shows (1) a gradual increase in the charging current, (2) a higher charging current at a low scan rate, and (3) a deviation from the linear relationship between the charging current and the scan rate. For galvanostatic charging/discharging, the results demonstrate (1) the curved charging/discharging behavior, (2) the larger voltage in the early stage, and (3) the lower voltage in longer charging. From empirical experimental results, CPE seems to model the real system better than the simple capacitor, indicating the ubiquitous CPE in electrochemistry. The CPE model may also apply to the characterization of various electrochemical systems with an arbitrary circuit model, especially the effective capacitance of supercapacitors with
