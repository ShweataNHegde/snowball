 <p>Porous silica-based materials are a promising alternative to graphite anodes for Li-ion batteries due to their high theoretical capacity, low discharge potential similar to pure silicon, superior cycling stability compared to silicon, abundance, and environmental friendliness. However, several challenges prevent the practical application of silica anodes, such as low coulombic efficiency and irreversible capacity losses during cycling. The main strategy to tackle the challenges of silica as an anode material has been developed to prepare carbon-coated SiO
  <sub>2</sub> composites by carbonization in argon atmosphere. A facile and eco-friendly method of preparing carbon-coated SiO
  <sub>2</sub> composites using sucrose is reported herein. The carbon-coated SiO
  <sub>2</sub> composites were characterized using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thermogravimetry, transmission and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and charge–discharge cycling. A C/SiO
  <sub>2</sub>-0.085 M calendered electrode displays the best cycling stability, capacity of 714.3 mAh·g
  <sup>−1</sup>, and coulombic efficiency as well as the lowest charge transfer resistance over 200 cycles without electrode degradation. The electrochemical performance improvement could be attributed to the positive effect of the carbon thin layer that can effectively diminish interfacial impedance.
