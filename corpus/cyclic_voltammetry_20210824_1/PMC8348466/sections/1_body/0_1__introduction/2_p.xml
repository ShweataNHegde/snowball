<p>Herein, we report a facile preparation route of the carbon-coated SiO
 <sub>2</sub> composites. Sucrose was employed as carbon source to prepare the carbon-coated SiO
 <sub>2</sub> composites by carbonization in argon atmosphere. The electrochemical performance was studied by cyclic voltammetry and charge/discharge tests. Unlike most reported carbon silica composites, the method proposed herein does not make use of complex procedures involving toxic precursors or strong acids such as sulfuric acid, and it has yielded novel composites with high electrochemical stability. The effect of starting carbon source concentration on the physicochemical and electrochemical properties of the resulting materials were also investigated.
