<p>Li-ion battery technology is at the core of the imminent massive vehicle electrification due to the forecast growth penetration rate of electrified vehicles [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-26-04531" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In this cutting-edge Li-ion battery technology, silicon seems to be the most promising candidate for next-generation Li-ion battery technology due to its high theoretical capacity of 4200 mAh·g
 <sup>−1</sup> (compared to 372 mAh·g
 <sup>−1</sup> for graphite) [

 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-04531" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Shifting to silicon as an anode material has the potential to deliver higher energy density for the batteries. The anode of a Li-ion battery should operate at low potentials and offer high specific energy capacity and density. However, several drastic challenges prevent the practical application of silicon anodes such as its huge (300%) volume change upon full lithiation, which causes the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) rupture or particle pulverization, leading to loss of electrical contact, fast reversible capacity loss, and low coulombic efficiency [

 <sub>2</sub>-based materials as a promising new alternative to graphite has been significantly increased due to the high theoretical capacity and low discharge potential similar to pure silicon. Research groups all over the world studied intensively how to tackle the drawback of low coulombic efficiency and irreversible capacity losses during cycling [

Carbon coating provides an effective solution to the above issue, improving the cycling stability by buffering the volume expansion of the silica particles [
