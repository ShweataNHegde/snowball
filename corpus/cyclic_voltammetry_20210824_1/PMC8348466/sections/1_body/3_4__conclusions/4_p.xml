<p>The C/SiO
 <sub>2</sub>-0.085 M material exhibits the best capacity of 714.3 mAh·g
 <sup>−1</sup>, coulombic efficiency near 100%, and the lowest charge transfer resistance, after 200 cycles, which can be attributed to the carbon-coated layer that effectively buffers the volume expansion of silica during the Li-ion insertion/extraction process. This material is a promising anode for high capacity and stability Li-ion batteries, which can be obtained through a facile and green method that does not use corrosive acids or solvents.
