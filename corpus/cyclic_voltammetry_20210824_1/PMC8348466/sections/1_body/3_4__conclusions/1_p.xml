<p>Carbon-coated SiO
 <sub>2</sub> composites were prepared through a facile and eco-friendly method, involving the carbonization of a sucrose–silica precursor at 900 °C. The effect of the starting sucrose concentration on the properties of the resulting materials was investigated in the 0.04–0.085 M range. All samples consist of carbon-coated silica nanoparticles. The carbon content increases with increasing precursor concentration. XPS analyses showed the presence of predominately sp
 <sup>2</sup> hybridized carbon, with minor sp
 <sup>3</sup> C and C-O species, while high-resolution TEM analyses have evidenced the presence of graphitized and fullerenic carbon nanofilms on the surface of the silica nanoparticles.
