<p>Both calendered and uncalendered electrodes were prepared with the synthesized composites. Cyclic voltammetry measurements show that reversible lithiation and delithiation occurs for both types of electrodes. The discharge capacity of the calendered electrodes increases with increasing initial sucrose concentration at all C rates. The charge transfer resistance is inversely proportional to the initial precursor concentration while also being lower for the calendered electrodes. The transfer resistance is lower after 200 chargingâ€“discharging cycles in all cases.</p>
