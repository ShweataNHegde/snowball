<p>The C/SiO
 <sub>2</sub>-0.085 M calendered electrode exhibits the best chargingâ€“discharging cycling stability after 200 cycles. No significant electrode degradation could be noticed. SEM-EDAX analyses on this electrode after 200 cycles show good structural stability and the absence of cracks, as well as the preservation of a homogenous distribution of carbon and silica.
