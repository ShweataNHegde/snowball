 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04531-f012">Figure 12</xref> displays the cycling performance of the C/SiO
 <sub>2</sub> composites with different carbon contents for both uncalendered and calendered electrodes, at 1C, over 200 cycles. Best results were obtained for the calendered electrodes, while cycle life improved with the increase of the carbon content. The C/SiO
 <sub>2</sub>-0.085 M composite’s calendered electrodes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04531-f012">Figure 12</xref>b) show the best cycling performance after 200 cycles, the capacity remaining above 714.3 mAh·g
 <sup>−1</sup> with CE = 98.9%). The results could be attributed to the coated carbon layer, which might act as a matrix that provides the best stable structure, buffering the volume changes during the cycling process. Increasing the carbon content could result in a thicker layer of coated carbon that can better accommodate the volume expansion of SiO
 <sub>2</sub> during cycling.
