<p>Cyclic voltammetry (CV) performance, for both uncalendered and calendered electrodes, was evaluated in the 0.001–3 V voltage window, at a scan rate of 0.1 mV·s
 <sup>−1</sup> for the initial three cycles (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04531-f009">Figure 9</xref>). Even though it is less visible in the first cycle, a cathodic peak appears between 0 and 0.5 V, which was attributed to the lithiation process of SiO
 <sub>2</sub> for both samples [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-26-04531" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The delithiation potential starts at 0.45 V and increases gradually until 1.15 V for the second and third cycles for the uncalendered electrode. The CV curves for the calendered C/SiO
 <sub>2</sub>-0.085 M electrode are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04531-f009">Figure 9</xref>b. Two anodic peaks can be observed at 0.45 V and 0.77 V at the second and third cycles, corresponding to the delithiation process [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-26-04531" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. All other materials exhibit similar voltage profiles with C/SiO
 <sub>2</sub>-0.085 M.
