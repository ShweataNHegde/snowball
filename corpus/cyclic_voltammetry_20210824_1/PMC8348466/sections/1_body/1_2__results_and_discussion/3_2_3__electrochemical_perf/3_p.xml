<p>The calendered electrodes show good rate capability, as presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04531-f011">Figure 11</xref>. The C/SiO
 <sub>2</sub>-0.085 M composite’s calendered electrode shows the best rate performance (1231.3 mAh·g
 <sup>−1</sup>, coulombic efficiency (CE) = 99.7% at C/10 and 922.2 mAh·g
 <sup>−1</sup>, CE = 99.5% at 1C). An increasing capacity when increasing the carbon content can be noticed, which is in agreement with other results from literature. The capacity decreases at higher C rate; however, a higher specific capacity could be obtained when returned to C/10, indicating that the capacity decrease at high C rates is reversible.
