 <sub>2</sub>-0.04 M, C/SiO
 <sub>2</sub>-0.055 M, and C/SiO
 <sub>2</sub>-0.085 M uncalendered and calendered electrodes at different cycles and C rate. Calendered electrodes exhibit the best discharge capacities: the discharge capacities corresponding to the fifth cycles at C/10 for the C/SiO
 <sub>2</sub>-0.04 M, C/SiO
 <sub>2</sub>-0.055 M, and C/SiO
 <sub>2</sub>-0.085 M are 818.8 mAh·g
 <sup>−1</sup>, 1042.2 mAh·g
 <sup>−1</sup>, and 1231.3 mAh·g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. It can also be seen that the calendered electrodes exhibit good discharge capacities at 1C: the discharge capacities corresponding to the fifth cycles at 1C for the C/SiO
 <sub>2</sub>-0.04 M, C/SiO
 <sub>2</sub>-0.055 M, and C/SiO
 <sub>2</sub>-0.085 M are 591.5 mAh·g
