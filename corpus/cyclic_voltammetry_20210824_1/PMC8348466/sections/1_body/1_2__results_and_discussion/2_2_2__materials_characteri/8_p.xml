<p>Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM): The morphology and structure of the calendered C/SiO
 <sub>2</sub>-0.085 M electrode after 200 cycles is displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04531-f008">Figure 8</xref>. Good structural stability and no cracks were noticed after 200 cycles (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04531-f008">Figure 8</xref>a). The carbon-coated layer could efficiently buffer the considerable volume expansion of SiO
 <sub>2</sub> and prevent the electrode materials from pulverization during chargeâ€“discharge cycles. A homogenous distribution of Si, O, and C elements was observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04531-f008">Figure 8</xref>b). The results confirm that silica nanoparticles were coated homogeneously with a carbon film that could explain the good electrochemical properties after 200 cycles.
