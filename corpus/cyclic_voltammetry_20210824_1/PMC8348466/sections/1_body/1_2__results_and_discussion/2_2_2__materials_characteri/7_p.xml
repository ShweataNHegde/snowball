<p>Thermogravimetric Analyses (TGA): Thermogravimetric analyses were performed in order to assess the carbon and silica content of the samples as well as their thermal stability. All TG analyses were carried out in synthetic air atmosphere. All samples exhibit gradual mass loss up to ≈120 °C, which is ascribed to the loss of physisorbed water and residual solvent (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04531-f007">Figure 7</xref>). The silica material shows a much higher content of physisorbed water in comparison with the carbon–silica composites, indicating that silica has a higher hydrophilic character than the composites. A gradual 4.7 wt % mass loss can be noticed for the SiO
 <sub>2</sub> sample in the 200–900 °C temperature range, which is characteristic for the condensation of surface silanol groups. All carbon–silica composites present a sharp mass loss step between 450 and 700 °C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04531-f007">Figure 7</xref>b). This mass loss can be explained as the combustion of the carbon present in the samples, as carbon reacts with the oxygen, forming CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Based on the residual mass at 1000 °C, the sample composition could be computed (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-04531-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The carbon content increases with increasing initial sucrose concentration, reaching 41.4 wt % carbon for the C/SiO
 <sub>2</sub>-0.085 M material.
