<p>Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM): TEM analysis was employed to assess the samples morphology and to confirm the XRD results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04531-f004">Figure 4</xref>). The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04531-f004">Figure 4</xref>a) image reveals an amorphous structure of the SiO
 <sub>2</sub> sample, with atomic arrangements in rare crystalline clusters on small distances, below 2.6 nm. The distances between the parallel fringes indicate that the small ordered arrangements are around 4.02 Å. The Fourier transform (FFT) of the HRTEM image confirms the existence of a pseudo amorphous structure, the distances to the neighbors of 1st order being approximately 4 Å. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image in the light field (BF) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04531-f004">Figure 4</xref>b) shows an agglomeration of nanoparticles. Both the spaces between the SiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles and the nanoparticles themselves are covered by a nanostructured carbon film (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04531-f004">Figure 4</xref>c). The HRTEM image (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04531-f004">Figure 4</xref>b. SiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles are covered by a thin film consisting of carbon nanostructures, the ordered arrangements of atoms having very short range. Areas with “wormhole” morphology, which might contain fullerenic nanostructures can also be noticed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04531-f004">Figure 4</xref>c, marked area). The main element in the nanowire highlighted by the square drawn in the image in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04531-f004">Figure 4</xref>b is carbon; also, the elements silicon and oxygen are present (EDAX spectrum—not presented).
