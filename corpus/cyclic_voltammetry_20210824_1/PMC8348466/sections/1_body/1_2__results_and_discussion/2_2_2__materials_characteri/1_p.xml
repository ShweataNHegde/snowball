<p>X-Ray Diffraction (XRD): The powder X-ray diffractograms were recorded for all samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04531-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Silica shows only a single, broad peak, centered at 23.1° 2θ, corresponding to amorphous SiO
 <sub>2</sub>. In contrast, carbon–silica composites exhibit two broad diffraction peaks. The first broad peak is shifted to lower 2θ angles, which can be explained by the superposition of the amorphous silica and the (002) graphitic carbon reflection. The (100) graphitic carbon Bragg reflection can also be noticed at ≈43.7° 2θ for all carbon-containing samples. As expected, the relative intensity of the (100) reflection increases with increasing carbon content in the composite. Both carbon peaks are broad, indicating the nanometer size of the graphitic domains. However, the low intensity of the (100) peak and the superposition of the (002) reflection over the amorphous silica peak makes the exact determination of the crystallite size unreliable. No other peaks can be noticed, indicating that the composites contain only silica and carbon.
