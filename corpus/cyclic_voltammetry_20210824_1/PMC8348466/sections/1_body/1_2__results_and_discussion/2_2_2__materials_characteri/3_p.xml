<p>The carbon content on the surface is increasing with the initial sucrose solution concentrations but not in a constant manner. However, the concentration does not influence the content of different C species on the surface. It is interesting to note that the O content on the surface is decreasing with the sucrose solution concentrations, indicating a better graphitization and coverage of the surface with carbon, as confirmed by the other characterization methods [
