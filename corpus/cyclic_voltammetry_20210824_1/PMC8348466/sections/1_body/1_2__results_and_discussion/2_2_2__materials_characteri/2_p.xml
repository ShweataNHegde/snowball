<p>X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS): The surface chemical composition of the carbonâ€“silica composite was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The general spectra, indicating the presence on the surface of Si, C, and O, are depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04531-f002">Figure 2</xref>. The C 1s, O 1s, and Si 2p high-resolution XPS spectra are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04531-f003">Figure 3</xref>. No significant changes in the O 1s and Si 2p spectra can be noticed, irrespective of the synthesis method. In contrast, the high-resolution C 1s peak can be fitted with several components, which depend on the preparation conditions. Thus, the components associated with C sp
 <sup>2</sup> (284.6 eV), sp
 <sup>3</sup> (285.5 eV), -C-OH (286.5 eV), O-C=O (288.8 eV), and -CO
 <sub>2</sub> adventitious species (290.7 eV) were identified according with the literature data [

 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-04531" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], as depicted in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-04531-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The content in oxygenated carbon is low, in comparison with the C sp
 <sup>2</sup> and sp
 <sup>3</sup> which remain the main components (70%), denoting a good graphitization method.
