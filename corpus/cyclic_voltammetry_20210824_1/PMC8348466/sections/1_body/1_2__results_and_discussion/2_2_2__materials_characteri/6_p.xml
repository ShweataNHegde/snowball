 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04531-f006">Figure 6</xref>b) exhibits a group of agglomerations of silica nanoparticles covered by an ultrafine size carbon nanostructured film. The HRTEM images shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04531-f006">Figure 6</xref>a,c display carbon films of different morphologies: the film in “area1” is more compact, with denser nanostructures, while the film in “area2” has discontinuities, being composed of nanosphere-like formations. “Area1” HRTEM (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04531-f006">Figure 6</xref>c) shows that the silica nanoparticles are covered by a thin film consisting of carbon nanostructures, the ordered arrangements of atoms being spaced at about 3.5 Å, which is a value commonly found in nanographitic structures. There are structures similar to short graphene strips but also possible turbostatic packaging. The HRTEM image in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04531-f006">Figure 6</xref>a shows the nanostructure of the area marked with “area2”; in this case, in the carbon film is predominantly composed of fullerenic structures. The elemental composition was also verified by energy-dispersive X-ray nanoanalysis (EDAX). The EDAX spectrum (not presented) was acquired in the nano-zone marked with “EDAX1” in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04531-f006">Figure 6</xref>d, proving the existence of silicon and oxygen as the main elements in the thicker areas (of darker contrast). The main element is carbon in the thin film surrounding the silica nanoparticles (the nano-zone marked “EDAX2” in
