<p>The electrode mixture was prepared by dispersing the active material (carbon-coated SiO
 <sub>2</sub> composite) with carbon additive in an aqueous solution (Milli-Q Water) of Carboxymethyl Cellulose CMC (Daicel Miraizu Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) for 2 h using an ultrasonic processor. Then, Styrene Butadiene Rubber SBR (JSR Micro NV) was added and gently mixed for 20 min. The final electrode suspension containing 80 wt % active material, 3 wt % super P (MTI Corp.), and 17 wt % CMC/SBR was sprayed uniformly onto a copper current collector foil (15 µm thickness, from Custom Cells) using an airbrush (IWATA HP-BCS, 0.5 mm nozzle and needle). The electrode sheets were dried in vacuum at 70 °C overnight. Some samples were subsequently calendered using a 3 t Roll Press Equipment from Thank Metal Japan. Thirteen mm diameter circular electrodes—calendered and uncalendered—were punched using a compact precision disc cutter (MTI Corp., Richmond, CA, USA) and vacuum-dried overnight at 70 °C. The average mass of active material, after drying, was 0.18082 mg·cm
 <sup>−2</sup>. Electrode disks with similar loadings were transferred into an argon-filled glovebox for coin half-cells assembly (CR2032).
