<p>The CR2032 half-cells were assembled using 15.6 × 0.45 mm Li-metal chips (Xiamen TOB New Energy Technology CO., LTD) as the counter and reference electrode. Glass microfiber filter disks (Whatman GF/D, 19 mm in diameter) were used as separator. Then, 80 µL of 1 M LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> in EC: EMC: DEC + 3 wt % FEC electrolyte supplied by Solvionic were used for each cell. The CR2032 cells were assembled using an electric coin cell crimper (MTI Corp.) and aged for 24 h. The charge–discharge measurements were carried out on a battery testing system (NEWARE) in a voltage range from 0.01 to 2 V. Cycling voltammetry measurements were recorded at room temperature using an Origaflex–OGF05A system, in the potential window of 0.001–3 V, at a scan rate of 0.1 mV·s
 <sup>−1</sup>. EIS measurements were performed before and after cycling, on a Solartron 1470 E Multi-Channel Potentiostat system over a frequency range from 100 KHz to 10 mHz.
