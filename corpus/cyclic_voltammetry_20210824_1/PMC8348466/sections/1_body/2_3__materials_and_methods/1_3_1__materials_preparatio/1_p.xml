<p>All materials used in this study were of analytical grade and were used without further purification. The anode active materials—the carbon-coated SiO
 <sub>2</sub> composites—were prepared via the aqueous pathway, which is a simply and eco-friendly preparation route. The preparation process of the carbon-coated SiO
 <sub>2</sub> composites is illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="molecules-26-04531-sch001">Scheme 1</xref>. Typically, aqueous sucrose (BioXtra, ≥99.5% (GC), Sigma-Aldrich) solutions (0.04 M, 0.055 M, 0.07 M, and 0.085 M) were prepared under continuous stirring. Then, the same amount of silica (Silicon dioxide nanopowder, spherical, porous, 5–15 nm in diameter, 99.5%, from Sigma Aldrich) was added to each sucrose solution. The resulting mixture was vigorous stirring at 70 °C until water was completely evaporated. The resulting white powder was dried in an oven, under vacuum, at 70 °C for 20 h, and then carbonized in a tube furnace in argon atmosphere at 900 °C for 1 h, using a heating ramp of 1 °C·min
 <sup>−1</sup>. Then, the prepared carbon-coated SiO
 <sub>2</sub> composite materials with different carbon content were used to prepare the anodes.
