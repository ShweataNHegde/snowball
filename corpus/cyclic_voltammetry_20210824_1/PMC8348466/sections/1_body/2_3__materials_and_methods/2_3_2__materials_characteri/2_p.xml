<p>X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). An AXIS Ultra DLD (Kratos Analytical Ltd., Manchester, UK) set up was used to perform XPS measurements. The radiation used was a monochromated Al Kα (hν = 1486.7 eV) of an X-ray gun, operating at a power of 144 W (12 kV/12 mA), at normal emission, and on a routine base pressure of 1 × 10
 <sup>−8</sup> Pa. To avoid charge effects, a charge neutralizer was used (electron acceleration at 1 eV and electron current of 0.1 mA) for all samples. The XPS spectra were fitted using a Voigt profile, and the spectra were calibrated at C1 s line (BE = 284.6 eV, C-C (CH)
 <sub>n</sub> bonds) of the adsorbed hydrocarbon on the sample surface.
