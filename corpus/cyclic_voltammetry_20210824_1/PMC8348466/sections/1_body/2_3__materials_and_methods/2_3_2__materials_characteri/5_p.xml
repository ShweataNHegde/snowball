<p>Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The morphology of the surface of the tested electrodes (after 200 cycles) was investigated through SEM analysis on a Quanta Inspect F instrument (FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA), with a field emission electron gun, 1.2 nm resolution, and X-ray energy-dispersive (EDAX) spectrometer having an accelerating voltage of 30 kV.</p>
