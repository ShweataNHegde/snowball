<p>Thermogravimetric Analyses (TGA). The thermal decomposition of samples was carried out using a Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA851e thermogravimeter, at a heating rate of 10 °C·min
 <sup>−1</sup>, under 80 mL·min
 <sup>−1</sup> synthetic air flow. All mass loss weight fractions were computed with respect to the dry sample mass, calculated at 150 °C.
