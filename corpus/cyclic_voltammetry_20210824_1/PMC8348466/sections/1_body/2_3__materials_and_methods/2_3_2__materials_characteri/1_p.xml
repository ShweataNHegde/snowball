<p>X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) Analysis. SiO
 <sub>2</sub> and carbon-coated SiO
 <sub>2</sub> composite samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD patterns were registered on a Panalytical X’PERT MPD Power Diffractometer (PANalytical, Almelo, The Netherlands) in the range 2θ = 10–80°, using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å).
