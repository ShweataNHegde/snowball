<p>The micropattern of CuHCFe thin film was obtained through a lift-off process. First, various patterns of the PR were defined on a platinum-coated glass substrate via photolithography. Then, 20 nm–thick copper thin film was deposited on the substrate through e-beam evaporation. The copper coated substrate was dipped into 1 mM K
 <sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)
 <sub>6</sub> solution for 24 h at room temperature (25 °C) and then rinsed with DI water. The PR was removed using acetone, and the coated substrate was rinsed with isopropanol and DI water and dried at 40 °C for a day in a convection oven.
