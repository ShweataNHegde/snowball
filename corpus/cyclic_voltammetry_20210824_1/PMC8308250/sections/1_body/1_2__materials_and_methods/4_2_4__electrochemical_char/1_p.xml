<p>The cyclic voltammetry analyses of the CuHCFe thin film and the micropatterned CuHCFe thin film were conducted using a potentiostat/galvanostat (SP300, Biologic, Seyssinet-Pariset, France). A three-electrode beaker cell was prepared with a platinum electrode coated with the CuHCFe thin film (or the micropatterned CuHCFe thin film) as the working electrode, activated carbon-coated carbon cloth as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl filled with saturated KCl electrolyte as the reference electrode. The electrodes were immersed in 1 M NaCl (or 1 M KCl) aqueous electrolyte. The potential scan range was 0.4 to 0.9 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), with a scan rate of 1 mV/s. To compare the electrochemical behaviors of the CuHCFe thin film and CuHCFe powder synthesized via a coprecipitation method, a conventional CuHCFe electrode and the CuHCFe powder were analyzed via cyclic voltammetry. All electrochemical measurements were conducted at 25 Â°C in atmosphere.</p>
