<p>Copper metal thin film was deposited by a physical vapor deposition method of e-beam evaporation. The 20 nm thick of copper thin film was deposited on a platinum deposited glass substrate. The substrate was dipped into 1 mM K
 <sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)
 <sub>6</sub> solution for 24 h at room temperature (25 °C) to form the CuHCFe thin film. The coated substrate was rinsed with DI water and dried at 40 °C for a day in a convection oven.
