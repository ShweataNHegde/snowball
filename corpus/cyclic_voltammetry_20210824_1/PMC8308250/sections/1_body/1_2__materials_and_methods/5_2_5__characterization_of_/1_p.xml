<p>Atomic force microscopy (AFM; Dimension Edge, Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA) was performed to measure the surface morphology of the CuHCFe thin films. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Apreo 2, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was performed to determine the morphology of the CuHCFe thin films. The ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectra of the K
 <sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)
 <sub>6</sub> solutions before and after reaction with copper were obtained using the Shimadzu UV 2450 spectrometer. The solutions for UV–vis analysis were contained in disposable cuvettes (UV-cuvette semi-micro, Brand, Wertheim, Germany). The Raman spectrum of the CuHCFe thin film was obtained using a lab-made system with laser (532 nm) and Raman spectrometer (UHTS 300, WITec, Ulm, Germany) at −70 °C.
