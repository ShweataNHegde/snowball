<p>The K
 <sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)
 <sub>6</sub> solution after reaction with copper metal was analyzed via UV–vis spectroscopy. Copper powder (10 mmol) was dispersed into 100 mL of 10 mM K
 <sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)
 <sub>6</sub> solution for 40 h with vigorous stirring. The molar amount of copper powder was 10 times that of K
 <sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)
 <sub>6</sub> to enable the complete reaction of the K
 <sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)
 <sub>6</sub> solution. The reacted K
 <sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)
 <sub>6</sub> solution was collected using a centrifuge, and its absorbance was measured. The spectrum of the reacted solution showed the absence of ferricyanide ions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01860-f004">Figure 4</xref>d), which indicates that the K
 <sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)
 <sub>6</sub> solution was reduced by copper metal and proves that copper was oxidized via Fe(CN)
 <sub>6</sub>
 <sup>3−</sup> reduction, as explained in the proposed mechanism of CuHCFe thin film deposition.
