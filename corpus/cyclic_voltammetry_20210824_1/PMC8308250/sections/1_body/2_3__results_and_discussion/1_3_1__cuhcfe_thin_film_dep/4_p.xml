 <sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)
 <sub>6</sub> solution temperature (5, 25, and 60 °C) and concentration (0.1, 1, and 10 mM) influenced the CuHCFe thin film surface morphology. Consistent with the AFM results, the SEM images showed that the CuHCFe thin film surface was rough at the high solution temperature. As the temperature and concentration of the K
 <sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)
 <sub>6</sub> solution increased, so did the crystal size of CuHCFe. At 60 °C and in 10 mM K
 <sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)
 <sub>6</sub> solution, owing to the fast reaction, the CuHCFe structure featured particle-like deposition rather than a thin film layer. The CuHCFe thin film grown at 5 °C and 0.1 mM of K
 <sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)
 <sub>6</sub> was not crystalline because of the low ferrocyanide flux toward the surface. Under high ferrocyanide flux toward the surface, the oxidized copper immediately reacted with ferrocyanide on the CuHCFe surface such that the CuHCFe structure became more crystalline. In contrast, under low ferrocyanide flux, copper ions diffused into the solution and then reacted with ferrocyanide.

 <sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)
 <sub>6</sub> had a crystalline CuHCFe structure because of the high diffusivity of ferrocyanide at the high temperature despite the low solution concentration. Based on the morphology analysis by AFM and SEM, the CuHCFe thin film grown at 25 °C and 1 mM K
 <sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)
 <sub>6</sub> was selected for the rest of the experiment because the copper thin film was fully transformed and the grown CuHCFe film was not too rough.
