<p>The line profiles of the step edge of CuHCFe thin films were characterized via AFM (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01860-f002">Figure 2</xref>e,f). The thicknesses of the CuHCFe thin films grown at 5, 25, and 60 °C were 292, 464, and 481 nm, respectively. The CuHCFe thin film was much thicker than the initial copper metal thin film (20 nm) because of a 2133% volumetric expansion in the thin film lattice during transformation. The lattice structures of copper metal and CuHCFe are face-centered cubic (FCC, space group Fm-3 m), and the lattice parameters of copper metal and CuHCFe are 0.362 and 1.004 nm, respectively [

 <xref rid="B27-nanomaterials-11-01860" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In the CuHCFe thin film, the film can expand in the direction normal to the copper surface because there is no lateral expansion of film. Therefore, the linear expansion of thickness during transformation from the copper thin film to a CuHCFe thin film was also 2133%, with the theoretical thickness of the CuHCFe thin film being 426.6 nm. The thicknesses of the CuHCFe thin films grown at 25 and 60 °C were greater than the theoretical thickness. The large crystalline structures of the CuHCFe thin films grown at 25 and 60 °C resulted in inaccuracies in the thickness measurement. However, the thickness of the CuHCFe thin film grown at 5 °C was lower than the theoretical value. We believe that unreacted copper metal film remained underneath the CuHCFe thin film because of the slow transportation of copper ions in the CuHCFe thin film at 5 °C. Although we prolonged the immersion time of the copper metal film in the potassium ferricyanide solution to 96 h, the thickness of the CuHCFe thin film was 250 nm, which was still lower than the theoretical thickness. Thus, the temperature of 25 °C or above was required to fully transform CuHCFe from copper. In addition, mass analysis proved the transformation of CuHCFe film from copper metal film.
