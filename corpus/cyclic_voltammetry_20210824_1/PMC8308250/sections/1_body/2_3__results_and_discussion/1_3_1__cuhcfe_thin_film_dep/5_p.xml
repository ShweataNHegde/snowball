<p>The electrochemical property of the CuHCFe thin film was characterized via cyclic voltammetry in 1 M NaCl and 1 M KCl aqueous electrolytes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01860-f004">Figure 4</xref>a,b). The 1 cm × 1 cm CuHCFe thin film was deposited on a platinum thin-film electrode. The peak potentials of cyclic voltammetry curves at 0.642 and 0.798 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) for 1 M NaCl and 1 M KCl electrolytes, respectively, indicate the redox reaction of the CuHCFe thin film. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-11-01860">Figure S1</xref>, the cyclic voltammetry curve of the CuHCFe thin film matched well with that of CuHCFe powder synthesized via coprecipitation method. The open-circuit voltage of the CuHCFe thin film after deposition was 0.322 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in 1 M NaCl, which corresponds to the reduced state of CuHCFe. This means that the CuHCFe thin film was formed from the reaction of copper ions with Fe(CN)
