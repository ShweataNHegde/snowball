 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01860-f001">Figure 1</xref> shows the schematic of the growth mechanism of the CuHCFe thin film, starting from the immersion of a copper metal thin film into the K
 <sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)
 <sub>6</sub> solution. The corrosion reaction of copper with ferricyanide (Fe(CN)
 <sub>6</sub>
 <sup>3−</sup>) occurred at the interface of the metal thin film and the solution (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01860-f001">Figure 1</xref>a). The oxidized copper simultaneously reacted with ferrocyanide (Fe(CN)
 <sub>6</sub>
 <sup>4−</sup>), resulting in the formation of copper ferrocyanide at the interface. Because the reaction between transition metals and ferrocyanide is very fast, the oxidized copper formed copper ferrocyanide, which attached to the surface instead of floating in the liquid [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01860-f001">Figure 1</xref>b). The copper metal thin film underneath the CuHCFe thin film was continuously oxidized by the continuous reduction of Fe(CN)

 <sup>3−</sup> and the copper ions are transferred to the top of the CuHCFe film (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01860-f001">Figure 1</xref>c). We believe that the copper ions were transferred through the CuHCFe thin film because the copper ions can intercalate into and deintercalate from CuHCFe [
 <xref rid="B26-nanomaterials-11-01860" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, copper was oxidized and then intercalated into the CuHCFe at the bottom of CuHCFe because oxidation potential of Cu/Cu
 <sup>2+</sup> is lower than formal potential of CuHCFe with intercalating copper ion. Copper ions deintercalated from the top surface of CuHCFe film and reacted with Fe(CN)

 <sup>4−</sup>, forming CuHCFe. The CuHCFe thin film deposition reaction continued until the copper was fully oxidized.
