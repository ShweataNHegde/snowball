<p>The surface morphologies of the CuHCFe thin films grown at different temperatures were characterized via AFM (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01860-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The morphology of the CuHCFe thin film grown at high temperature (60 °C) was rougher than that of the film grown at low temperature (5 °C). The higher temperature induced the faster oxidation of copper metal and the transportation of copper ion through the CuHCFe thin film, resulting in a larger CuHCFe nanocrystal. Likewise, the lower temperature induced slower oxidation rates, resulting in the formation of smaller CuHCFe nanocrystals and smoother surface morphology. The surface roughnesses of the CuHCFe thin films were calculated based on the AFM images using a software program. The roughnesses (Ra) of the CuHCFe thin films grown at 5, 25, and 60 °C were 7.44, 20.5, and 61.8 nm, respectively. The line profiles of the CuHCFe thin films also showed that the height variation of the CuHCFe thin film grown at 5 °C was smaller than those of the CuHCFe thin films grown at 25 and 60 °C.
