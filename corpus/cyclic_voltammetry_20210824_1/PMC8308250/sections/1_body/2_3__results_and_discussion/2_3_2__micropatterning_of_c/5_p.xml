<p>Constant potential was applied to one electrode (working electrode 1, WE1) and cyclic potential was applied to the other electrode (working electrode 2, WE2). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01860-f006">Figure 6</xref>b–e show the measured currents of WE1 and WE2 when 0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) was applied to WE1 and cyclic potentials from 0.4 to 0.8 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at the scan rates of 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 mV/s were applied to WE2. Two types of currents were generated in this electrochemical cell: current flowing through the CuHCFe thin film because of the electrical conductivity of CuHCFe and the potential difference between WE1 and WE2 and redox current from the redox reaction of the CuHCFe thin film on a Pt electrode. The electronic conductivity of intercalation materials depends on the cation concentration gradient in the materials [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01860-f004">Figure 4</xref>a), we infer that sodium ions started to deintercalate at 0.55 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). Therefore, when the WE2 potential was lower than 0.55 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), the conductivity of the CuHCFe thin film was low because of the small gradient of sodium ion concentration in the CuHCFe film. The conductivity gradually increased as the potential of WE2 increased, because the cation concentration gradient between WE1 and WE2 increased with increasing WE2 potential. Hence, the CuHCFe thin film exhibited a nonlinear current behavior (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01860-f006">Figure 6</xref>b). Besides the electronic current through CuHCFe film, the ionic current is minor compared to the electronic current and zero at the steady state. Because a constant potential was applied to WE1, there was no redox reaction of the CuHCFe on WE1, which means that the current in WE1 did not contain redox current. However, because of the cyclic potential applied to the electrode, the current in WE2 contained redox current from the CuHCFe on WE2. Consequently, the current of WE2 comprised the electronic current through the CuHCFe thin film and the current from the redox reaction of the CuHCFe on a Pt electrode. The current of WE1 was only that flowing through the CuHCFe thin film from WE1 to WE2. As the scan rate increased, the current hysteresis on WE1 increased, and the redox current on WE2 increased. The hysteresis came from the slow diffusion of cation in CuHCFe. The increase in redox current occurred because the peak current of cyclic voltammetry is proportional to the scan rate to the power of b (b = 0.5–1) [
