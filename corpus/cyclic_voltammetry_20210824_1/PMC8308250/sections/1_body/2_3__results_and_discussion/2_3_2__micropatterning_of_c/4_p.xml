<p>Furthermore, a CuHCFe-based microelectrochemical device was fabricated and used to measure the electrical conductance of the micropatterned CuHCFe thin film (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01860-f006">Figure 6</xref>a). A polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) well was assembled with the CuHCFe microdevice and filled with an aqueous electrolyte of 1 M NaCl. A Ag/AgCl electrode in saturated KCl solution and a platinum wire were used as the reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively (

In the bipotentiostat mode, two working electrodes are sharing the reference electrode and the counter electrode and the potential of each working electrode can be controlled independently and the relevant current measured. The dimensions of the CuHCFe thin film between two electrodes were 20 μm (width) × 10 μm (length) × and 426 nm (thickness).
