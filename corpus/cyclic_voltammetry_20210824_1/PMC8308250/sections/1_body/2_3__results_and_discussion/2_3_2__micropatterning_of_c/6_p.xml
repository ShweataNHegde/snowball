<p>The current hysteresis of the CuHCFe thin film at a high scan rate implies that the cation diffusivity in CuHCFe could affect the current. Herein, we developed a model to investigate the effect of cation diffusion on the electronic current in the CuHCFe thin-film device. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01860-f007">Figure 7</xref>a shows the electrochemical state of the CuHCFe film at fast and slow scan rates. At the fast scan rate, there is not enough time for sodium ions inside the CuHCFe thin film to diffuse out. Sharp cation concentration gradient in the CuHCFe film is built near WE2 and gradual concentration gradient is built near WE1. Because the electrical conductivity of intercalation materials is proportional to ion concentration in the materials, the electrical conductivity of the CuHCFe film is low due to the gradual concentration gradient near WE1. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01860-f007">Figure 7</xref>b shows the WE1 current under forward scanning at rates of 0.01 and 10 mV/s and the current calculated by a numerical simulation. We investigated the currents of WE1 at different scan rates because the current of WE1 can be assumed to be the electronic current through the CuHCFe thin film. The WE1 current at the scan rate of 10 mV/s showed a delayed response compared with that at 0.01 mV/s. This delayed response resulted from the relatively slow transportation of sodium ions in the CuHCFe thin film. Through the finite element method, the diffusivity of sodium ions in the CuHCFe film was estimated. The detailed method is described below.
