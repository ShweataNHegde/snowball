<p>The microelectrochemical device was fabricated through conventional microfabrication processes and the CuHCFe thin film deposition. First, platinum electrodes were defined on a glass substrate via physical vapor deposition and a lift-off process (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01860-f005">Figure 5</xref>b). The CuHCFe thin film was obtained by immersing the substrate into a 1 mM K
 <sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)
 <sub>6</sub> solution for 24 h at 25 °C (

To prevent electrical leakage through the electrolyte onto the platinum electrodes and the CuHCFe thin film, their surfaces were covered with PR except for the area where the CuHCFe thin film and platinum electrode were stacked (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01860-f005">Figure 5</xref>e). The optical microscopy image of the CuHCFe microdevice shows that the layers of platinum electrodes, CuHCFe thin film, and PR were well stacked (
