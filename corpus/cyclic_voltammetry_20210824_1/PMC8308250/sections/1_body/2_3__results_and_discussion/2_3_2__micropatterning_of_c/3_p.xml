<p>As described above, the CuHCFe thin film could be micropatterned through photolithography and the lift-off of the CuHCFe thin film. The methods enabled the deposition of the desired size of CuHCFe thin film on the desired area. We deposited an array of microsized CuHCFe thin film on a platinum electrode to characterize the microsized CuHCFe thin film. Dot and line patterns of the CuHCFe thin film were deposited. The optical microscope image of the microsized CuHCFe thin film (
