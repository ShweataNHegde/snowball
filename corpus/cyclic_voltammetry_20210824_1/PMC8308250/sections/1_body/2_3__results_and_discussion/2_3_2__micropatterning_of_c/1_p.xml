<p>The CuHCFe thin film deposition method can be utilized to fabricate a CuHCFe-based microelectrochemical device. Because this deposition method can deposit CuHCFe thin film on a nonconductive substrate, CuHCFe thin film can be deposited between two separated metal electrodes. Given that the conventional electrodeposition method requires subjecting the electrode to electric potential, it cannot realize deposition on a nonconductive substrate. Our deposition method allows the deposition of a uniform CuHCFe thin film between two separated electrodes regardless of the gap width between two electrodes.</p>
