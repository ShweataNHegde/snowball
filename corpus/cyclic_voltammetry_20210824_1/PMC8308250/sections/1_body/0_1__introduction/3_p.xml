<p>In this paper, we introduce a new method to obtain a thin film of copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCFe) by dipping a copper metal film into a potassium hexacyanoferrate solution. The copper film is oxidized by reducing hexacyanoferrate, and the copper ion subsequently forms CuHCFe by reacting with the reduced hexacyanoferrate. The temperature and concentration of hexacyanoferrate solutions influenced the surface morphology of the CuHCFe thin film. The CuHCFe thin film was characterized via electrochemical and spectroscopic methods. Micropatterning of the CuHCFe thin film through the lift-off process was used to develop a PBA-based microelectrochemical system to measure the electrical current of the CuHCFe thin film during electrochemical reaction. The diffusivity of sodium ions in CuHCFe was estimated using a numerical model of the electrical current.</p>
