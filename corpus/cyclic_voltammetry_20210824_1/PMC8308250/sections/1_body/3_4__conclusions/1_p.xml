<p>In summary, we developed a CuHCFe thin film growth process involving the immersion of a copper metal thin film into a potassium hexacyanoferrate solution. The surface morphologies of CuHCFe thin films grown at different conditions (temperature and concentration of potassium hexacyanoferrate solution) were characterized via AFM and SEM. The CuHCFe thin film grown at 5 °C had smooth surface morphology; however, the 20 nm–thick copper metal film was not fully converted to CuHCFe thin film. The CuHCFe thin film grown at 25 °C was characterized via cyclic voltammetry and Raman spectrometry. Because the grown film is compatible with the conventional photolithography processes, a micropattern array of the CuHCFe thin film was deposited at a desired location using the lift-off process. A CuHCFe-based microelectrochemical device was fabricated, and an electrochemical system was built to measure the electrical current of the CuHCFe thin film. The diffusivity of sodium ions in the CuHCFe thin film was calculated through the numerical simulation of electrical conduction and diffusion of the CuHCFe thin film. The proposed film deposition method can be applied for the deposition of not only CuHCFe but also PBAs because the method is not limited to copper metal; it can also be applied for nonconductive substrates and arbitrary surfaces. The CuHCFe microdevice paves the way for new types of electrochemical transistors and sensors and provides a means to comprehensively clarify PBAs.</p>
