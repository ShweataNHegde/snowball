<p>In regard to point (i), it is clear that the evaluation of the ESW must be conducted on cells containing a composite working electrode to increase the interfacial contacts with the electrolyte, compared to the commonly used planar electrodes, and to better simulate the real electrolyte environment present in a battery cell. This can be a solid electrolyte/carbon composite electrode (assuming no interfacial reaction happens at the surface of CB due to surface groups and/or remaining water) or the electrode material really used in the battery cell (LFP, LMOâ€¦)</p>
