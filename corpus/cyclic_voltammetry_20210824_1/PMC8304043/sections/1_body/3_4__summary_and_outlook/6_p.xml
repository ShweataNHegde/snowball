<p>Concerning point (ii), upgraded methods such as improved potentiodynamic techniques (CV or LSV using improved setups), PITT-type evaluation with impedance measurements, or galvanostatic techniques must be preferentially used. Performing these experiments with low scanning rates is also an important kinetic factor with respect to the sluggish degradation reactions in the complete solid state. Also, the complementarity of computational methods is beneficial for a better clarification of the ESW.</p>
