<p>Also, several authors agreed that it was necessary to avoid the use of planar inert electrodes (SS, Ptâ€¦) for the evaluation of the ESW. Indeed, the use of planar electrodes often leads to an overestimated ESW value due to the small surface area and, thus, diminished contact with electrolyte which affects the current density and influences the overpotential. Thus, the association between the classical LSV and cell configurations with planar electrodes generally leads to misestimated ESW values. It is very surprising that a lot of studies still employ this setup for the determination of the ESW.</p>
