<p>Li-ion batteries have been marketed since the early 1990s for several common applications, especially in portable devices and more recently for transportation and stationary power storage [

Compared with other energy storage devices, lithium-ion batteries have demonstrated many advantages including good energy density and long cycle life. However, even if a lot of progress has been made in recent years (for instance, efficient electric vehicles are presently available on the market), commercial batteries still need to be improved to achieve high energy and power densities while complying with safety requirements [
 <xref rid="B2-materials-14-03840" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These current limitations are partly due to the restrictions imposed by electrode materials but also due to the poor stability (thermal, chemical, electrochemical, etc.) of liquid electrolytes. Indeed, the typical mixture of liquid alkyl carbonate solvents and lithium salts present in traditional Li-ion batteries is highly flammable and may lead to critical safety issues [
