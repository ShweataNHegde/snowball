<p>The second part is dedicated to upgraded methods and practices for a careful evaluation of ESWs. Additionally, we will present our vision on how to accurately measure the ESW of an electrolyte. The objective is to highlight the best measurement techniques to generate a better understanding and a more realistic interpretation of ESW values for SPEs and SCEs, which are expected to lead to better ASSLB stability and performance.</p>
