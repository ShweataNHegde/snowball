<p>Thereby, the research on the development of new Lithium battery systems such as All Solid-State Lithium Batteries (ASSLB) has greatly increased since the early 2000s (

In these devices, the traditional organic liquid electrolyte is replaced by a solid electrolyte that is both non-flammable and highly thermally stable. Furthermore, as no liquid is used in solid electrolytes, the entire battery packaging can be simplified, reducing dead weight, which results in an increase of the gravimetric and volumetric energy densities [
