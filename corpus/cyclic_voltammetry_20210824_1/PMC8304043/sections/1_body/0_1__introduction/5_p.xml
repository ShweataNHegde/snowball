<p>Considering that an accurate measurement of the electrochemical stability window is a key parameter for the development of all solid-state batteries, we propose in this work a literature overview that focuses specifically on the evaluation of the electrochemical stabilities of Solid Polymer Electrolytes (SPEs) and their composites with ceramic/inorganic fillers (SCEs).</p>
