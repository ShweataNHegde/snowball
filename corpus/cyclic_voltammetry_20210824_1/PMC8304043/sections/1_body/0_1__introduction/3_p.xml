<p>To date, three major categories of solid electrolytes (SE) have been developed: Inorganic Solid Electrolytes (ISE), Solid Polymer Electrolytes (SPE) and Solid Composite Electrolytes (SCE) [
 <xref rid="B5-materials-14-03840" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. ISEs generally have better ionic conductivities and lithium transference numbers than SPEs, but the latter present more flexibility, better processability and generally a good interfacial contact with the electrode materials, whether it is lithium metal or a composite electrode [
