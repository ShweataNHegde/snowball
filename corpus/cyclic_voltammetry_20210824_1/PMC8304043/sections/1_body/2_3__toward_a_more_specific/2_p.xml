<p>The purpose of this section is to highlight articles that are specifically dedicated to the evaluation of the ESW of electrolytes. This chapter is focused on describing “advanced” methods to accurately evaluate the ESW of SPEs and SCEs. Some papers on Inorganic Solid Electrolytes (ISE) or liquid electrolytes are also addressed in this part when an interesting approach to the ESW evaluation is conducted and that can be adapted for use in systems employing SPEs and SCEs.</p>
