<p>The architecture and the configuration of the electrochemical cell for ESW determination is indeed an important parameter. Although standard cells consist of three-electrodes (working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode), most of the measurements, for convenience, (specifically for battery applications) are made in a two-electrode cell configuration (with one electrode playing the role of both reference and counter electrode). Most of the studies use metallic lithium as both reference and counter electrode assuming that the SPE or SCE materials are stable vs. lithium or indium-lithium alloys and stainless steel as a working electrode. Sometimes these experimental considerations vary (different electrode materials) and strongly impact the value of the ESW. These considerations will be discussed in detail in the next section.</p>
