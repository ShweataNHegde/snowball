<p>Moreover, authors claimed that the difference between cutoff currents is not the only reason for the inaccuracy of conventional ESW evaluation methods. To satisfy this conventional method, they identified two prerequisites. First of all, the capacitance of the working electrode must be negligible. Then, the faradic component of the current (I
 <sub>f</sub>) must only be dictated by a decomposition mechanism. These settled conditions imply that no other faradic process than electrolyte decomposition takes place and can be sharply approached when nonporous electrodes such as GC or Pt are used in a potentiodynamic experiment due to their stability. This allows the absence of other faradaic processes on the working electrode, except for impurities which can be easily lowered beneath 0.1 mA/cm
 <sup>2</sup> by rigorous drying of the electrolyte solvent and high purification of the electrolyte solution. However, these ideal conditions are no longer valid for battery applications, where electrode materials are not GC or Pt but rather various composite materials with high capacity which results in additional faradic processes. Furthermore, as active material are often moderate electronic conductors, conductive additives (usually carbon black) are added to the electrode formulation. Thus, the non-faradic part of the current density is no longer negligible as in the ideal case mentioned above. Also, the electrolyte decomposition is affected by the surface of the composite electrode. In conclusion, a narrower ESW should result for real systems and results obtained by conventional analyses with GC or Pt working electrodes cannot describe the anodic stability of electrolytes in real battery devices. Thus, according to the authors, using the same electrode material as that employed with the electrolyte in the real battery cell is the only way to obtain a reliable evaluation of the electrochemical stability window.
