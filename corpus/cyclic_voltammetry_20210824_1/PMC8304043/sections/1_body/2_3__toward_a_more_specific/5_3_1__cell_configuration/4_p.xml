<p>First, they applied the conventional approach (i.e., linear or cyclic voltammetry on nonporous electrode is used for the determination of the ESW). As they explained, the limiting redox potentials are ascribed where the de-composition current achieves a predefined level. However, the choice of these cutoff criteria is not supported by any theoretical considerations and is therefore arbitrary. Depending on the authors, cutoff currents of 10 µA/cm
 <sup>2</sup>, 50 µA/cm
 <sup>2</sup>, 0.5 or 1 mA/cm
 <sup>2</sup> (most popular) can be chosen. At the end, the difference in stability data imposed by these arbitrary cutoff criteria would be too important to ignore and could lead to conflicting conclusions on the electrolyte stability evaluation.
