<p>Other works insist on the use of working electrodes that are as close to the real battery electrodes as possible for ESW investigations. Kasnatscheew et al. performed a study [
 <xref rid="B122-materials-14-03840" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>] in which they argue that even though a classical measurement (LSV) with an inert working electrode (Pt, glassy carbon) is well adapted for qualitative comparison, it becomes inappropriate in the prediction of a precise electrochemical stability value. This is mainly attributed to the electrode surface area, which is different from that of high surface composite electrodes used in practical devices. This affects the current density and, consequently, the overpotential. Additionally, the electrode composition and surface area are presumed to have an impact on the catalytic activity. To overcome these drawbacks, ESW measurements with LMO electrodes are proposed. This condition reasonably reflects a more realistic battery application. However, concerns and issues linked to this method are still pointed out by authors. There are doubts concerning the validity of this method, as it is not clear whether the obtained stability data can actually be transferred to a real LIB device. First, the chemical composition of the different active materials used in LIBs can, for instance, affect the stability limit via catalytic effects. Then, the determination of the ESW is based on a potentiodynamic principle, while LIB cycling is based on a constant current principle. These differences could have an influence on the determination of the electrolyte stability limit.
