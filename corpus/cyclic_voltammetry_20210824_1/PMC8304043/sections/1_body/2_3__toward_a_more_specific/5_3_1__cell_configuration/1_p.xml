<p>As was mentioned previously, the standard cell configuration for the evaluation of the ESW is a Lithium/electrolyte/stainless steel (SS) cell (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-03840-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Sometimes, variations, such as the use of other inert planar electrodes, can be observed. For instance, Piana et al. [
 <xref rid="B62-materials-14-03840" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] used Cu metal foil and carbon black coated Al foil as working electrodes for cathodic and anodic scans, respectively, with Li metal as both the counter and the reference electrodes. However, some authors who have focused on characterizing suitable ESW evaluation insist on the importance of the cell configuration and especially on the suppression of the inert planar electrode. Indeed, their geometric surface area and chemical composition is negligible compared to that of the composite electrodes that are used in practical battery devices and, thus, disregard the real electrochemical environment of the evaluated electrolytes. This often results to an overestimation and inappropriate ESW values.
