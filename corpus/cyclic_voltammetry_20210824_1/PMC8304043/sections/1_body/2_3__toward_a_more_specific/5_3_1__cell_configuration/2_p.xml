<p>In their work (1999) Xu et al. [
 <xref rid="B121-materials-14-03840" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>] recommended that to achieve a real electrochemical stability window (for capacitor and battery applications), the electrode material used for the ESW evaluation should simulate the electrodes used in a real system. The electrolyte stability data generated by conventional approaches (cf. 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec1-materials-14-03840">Section 1</xref>) could be inaccurate when applied to electrolytes in real devices. Although this work dealt with liquid electrolytes, it is reasonable to assume that these ideas could be extended to solid electrolytes (i.e., with SPEs and SCEs). Some experimental details of their work are presented here. First, the electrolytes, electrode materials, and subsequent measurements were all handled under vacuum in an argon-filled glove box where both H
 <sub>2</sub>O and O
 <sub>2</sub> content was below 5 ppm. Solvents of electrolytes were redistilled and well dried until the moisture content decreased below 100 ppm (around 50 ppm as determined according to the Karl Fischer titration method).
