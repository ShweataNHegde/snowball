<p>About their experimental results, they concluded on the inaccuracy of the stability window measurement when employing nonporous electrodes on the battery electrolyte. They determined that using the electrode material approaching the surface state and surface area of the electrodes used in real devices was the best solution. Authors claim that this solution should be universal, instead of being considered confined to the determination of anodic stability of battery electrolytes only. They also concluded about the fact that few ESW values had been obtained in this way at the time of their article. “That time” was in 1999 and, considering that the first part of this review was only based on recent papers (2019–2020), it seems that twenty years did not make a significant difference.</p>
