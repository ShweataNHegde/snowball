<p>Linear or cyclic voltammetry were used for measuring the current-potential (i-V) polarization curves of the tested electrolytes. The three-electrode cell configuration was employed with either Pt wire, glassy carbon (GC), activated carbon (AC) film or lithium battery cathode composite Li
 <sub>x</sub>Mn
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> as working electrodes, and with Li
 <sup>+</sup>/Li as the reference electrode. Lithium foil was used as the counter electrode for lithium battery tests. A scan rate of 5.0 mV/s was typically used, except for cathode composite where the measurement was performed at 0.1 mV/s, owing to the slow lithium-ion diffusion process inside the spinel materials.
