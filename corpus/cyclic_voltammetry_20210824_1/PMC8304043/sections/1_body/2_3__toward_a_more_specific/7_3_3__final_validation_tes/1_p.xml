<p>Ultimately, the objective of the present manuscript concerns not only the intrinsic stability of the electrolyte but also the electrochemical stability of the entire battery cell. As discussed before, in addition to the use of improved setups, performing tests with real battery electrode materials (cf. 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot1-materials-14-03840">Section 3.1</xref>) in full cell configuration is critical for the validation of the overall electrochemical stability of the device. In such cases, the stability of the cell is diagnosed via the monitoring of the Coulombic efficiency and capacity retention. A Coulombic efficiency of at least &gt;99.9% upon prolonged 99.9% is targeted to achieve high stability [

Assembling such cell implies the selection of various materials including the current collector, the choice and quality of the active materials and metallic lithium [

 <xref rid="B138-materials-14-03840" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>], and the optimisation of a considerable amount of parameters such as the composite electrode formulation [
 <xref rid="B139-materials-14-03840" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>], the electrodes and solid electrolyte thickness, the crystallinity (single/poly) of the cathode material, the issues associated with the use of metallic lithium [
