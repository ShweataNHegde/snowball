<p>Even if it is barely addressed, some authors try to improve the evaluation of the electrochemical stability of the electrolytes. Two main characteristics arise regarding a suitable evaluation of the ESW: the cell construction and the optimization of the experimental setup generally based on the techniques previously described (LSV and CV).</p>
