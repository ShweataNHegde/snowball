<p>Another interesting work proposes an improved CV setup to analyze the ESW of a solid electrolyte [
 <xref rid="B125-materials-14-03840" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. Dewald et al. applied what they call a “stepwise cyclic voltammetry” method to evaluate the practical oxidative stability of various inorganic solid electrolytes (SE) such as Li
 <sub>10</sub>GeP
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>12</sub>, Li
 <sub>2</sub>S-P
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>5</sub> or Li
 <sub>6</sub>PS
 <sub>5</sub>Cl. For reasons already mentioned in the previous section about the necessity of avoiding the use of planar electrodes, the authors decided to replace the traditional working electrode by a SE-carbon black composite electrode with higher surface area in order to increase the interfacial contacts between the components and, thus, the sensitivity of the measurement. Additionally, as the electrolytes are expected to decompose in contact with Li metal, indium metal is used as a counter electrode to minimize the reaction current arising from the decomposition on the anode side and to ensure that no additional lithium source is present. Their results, presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-03840-f008">Figure 8</xref>, clearly show the impact of the replacement of the inert working electrode by a composite electrode on the ESW determination.
