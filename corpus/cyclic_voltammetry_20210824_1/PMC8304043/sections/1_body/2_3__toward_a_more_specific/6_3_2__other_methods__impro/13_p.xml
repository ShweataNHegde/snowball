<p>Thus, in order to overcome these limitations, they developed an alternative method based on capacity measurements which they named the reversibility test. Briefly, a cyclic voltammetry is performed, and the charge capacities of the cathodic and anodic responses are compared. The ratio between the anodic and the cathodic capacity corresponds to the irreversibility of the process. The capacity ratio remains similar when the electrolyte is electrochemically stable but varies when the potentials exceed the stability threshold of the electrolyte. By this method, the anodic stabilities of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and hydrogenated nitrile butadiene rubber (HNBR), both blended with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI), were identified to be 3.6 and 3.7 V vs. Li
