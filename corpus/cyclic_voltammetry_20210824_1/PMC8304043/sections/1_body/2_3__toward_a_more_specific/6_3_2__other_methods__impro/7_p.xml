<p>In this study, the authors also concluded that the main source of the sudden battery failure was the Li/SPE interface and, particularly, Li dendrite formation and penetration through the SPE membrane rather than the SPE/NMC interface. Finally, they claim that “it is the cell set-up (PEO thickness, negative electrode), which is crucial for the voltage-noise associated failure, and counterintuitively not the high potential of the positive electrode.”</p>
