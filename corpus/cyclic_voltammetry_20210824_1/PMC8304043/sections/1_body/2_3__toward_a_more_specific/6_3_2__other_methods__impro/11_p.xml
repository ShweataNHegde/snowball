<p>Recently, Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B130-materials-14-03840" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>] determined the absolute anodic stability threshold of polymer electrolytes via a capacity-based electrochemical method. The objective was to address the limitations imposed by traditional approaches such as LSV. The authors claim that “the inconsistency of LSV is intrinsic to the method”. The comparison of electrolytes with distinct conductivities is problematic due to the proportionality of the current density and the electrolyte conductivity. Mass transport limitations cause difficulty in the theoretical analysis and lead to greater error for any method based on current density. Their point is clearly presented in
