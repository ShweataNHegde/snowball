<p>The authors explain that close to the true stability potential of the electrolyte (E
 <sub>onset</sub>), the Faradaic current (i
 <sub>onset</sub>) and the capacitive current (i
 <sub>C</sub>) may be too intricate to be distinguished. Thus, to clearly assign a faradic reaction, a significant increase of the observed current density is needed and the systematic error is the difference between i
 <sub>onset</sub> and i
 <sub>obs</sub>. Due to the slow kinetics and low diffusion processes in solid state systems, the i-E curve will be flattened, and a larger error is expected compared to liquid electrolytes. Also, the shape of the voltammogramm can influence the value of the systematic error which becomes unique to each case and quasi-impossible to correct between samples or by repeated measurements. Thus, a noticeable disparity is expected to be inherent to the LSV method for the ESW determination of polymer electrolytes.
