<p>Electrochemical measurements were conducted on PEO and SEO (Polystyrene–b–poly(ethyleneoxide)) containing LiTFSI salt in cells with different working electrode materials in both two and three electrode cell configurations at a scanning rate of 15 mV/s. The electrode materials are either used as current collectors in lithium-ion batteries or are intended as inert electrodes for examining oxidative degradation of the polymer electrolytes. An electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was performed for every sample before and after every set of electrochemical tests to ensure that the sample was still exhibiting behavior in the same way as a pristine cell. Among the results obtained by these upgraded LSV measurements, the authors found an electrochemical stability for the SEO electrolyte of around 5 V at 40 °C. Based on their experiments on Cu/SEO/Li cells, they concluded that over-discharge should be avoided to prevent Cu corrosion (as with liquid electrolytes for battery applications). This work demonstrated a different way of using LSV methods to improve precision in the determination of the ESW.</p>
