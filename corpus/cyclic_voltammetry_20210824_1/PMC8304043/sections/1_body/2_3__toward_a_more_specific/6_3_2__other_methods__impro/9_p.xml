<p>By employing In/InLi as both the reference/counter electrode and planar stainless steel as the working electrode, only small currents are detected (black curve). Using a carbonâˆ’solid electrolyte composite electrode to the cell (orange curve) leads to higher currents. Consequently, important oxidative decomposition reactions are now visible, mainly due to the huge difference in surface area between a flat (steel) and 3D conductive electrode (composite carbon electrode). In order to determine more precisely the oxidation onset potential of the electrolyte they established a stepwise CV approach. Each CV was measured twice at a low scan rate (0.1 mV/s) followed by a stepwise increase of the potential range by 0.1 V up to 4.4 V vs. In/InLi (approx. 5 V vs. Li
 <sup>+</sup>/Li). Authors once again pointed out the necessity of avoiding the use of classical working planar electrodes (SS, Pt) for a better evaluation of the ESW. Their stepwise cyclic voltammetry method could be transferred to the evaluation of SPEs and SCEs. Other works propose the use of solid electrolyte composite electrodes for better ESW evaluations with carbon [
