<p>Kasnatscheew et al. [
 <xref rid="B122-materials-14-03840" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>] assessed the validity of the potentiodynamic based ESW method by comparing the data with that obtained by galvanostatic method on commercial positive electrodes. They demonstrated the good agreement of the two methods on the determination of the oxidation stabilities of electrolytes. Additionally, they were able to quantify the parasitic reactions by comparing the specific capacity losses obtained in half of the cells during cycling experiments.
