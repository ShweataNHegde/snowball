 <xref rid="materials-14-03840-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> groups several results including values of E
 <sub>ox</sub> for SPEs and SCEs (depending on the method of evaluation, temperature of the experiment, and scanning rate during the analysis) from recent articles spanning 2019â€“2020. It is worth noting that ESW includes stabilities in terms of oxidation (E
 <sub>ox</sub>) and reduction (E
 <sub>red</sub>) potentials. When an additional current to the capacitive one appears, this underlines a faradic reaction (oxidation or reduction of the material/electrolyte) beyond which the system is no more stable. Some authors make the distinction between E
 <sub>ox</sub> and E
 <sub>red</sub>. However, in most papers the study is only concentrated on E
 <sub>ox</sub> because most SPEs and SCEs are assumed to be compatible with Li metal (specifically those containing PEO). Thus, ESW is sometimes simply assimilated to E
 <sub>ox</sub>.
