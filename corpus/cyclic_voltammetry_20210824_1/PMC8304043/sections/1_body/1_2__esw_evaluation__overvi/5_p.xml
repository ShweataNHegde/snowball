<p>This overview of SPEs and SCEs based on recent literature allows us to evidence not only the variety of the tested systems but also of the experimental parameters (method, scanning rate, temperature) for the ESW evaluation of the solid polymer and composite electrolytes. Also, upon scanning the literature, the ESW is recognized as a parameter of importance but appears to come almost secondary in comparison to ionic conductivity. Consequently, the accurate evaluation of the electrochemical stability (ESW) of the electrolytes is often briefly addressed in most papers.</p>
