<p>This section focuses on the ESW evaluation for SPEs and their composite counterparts with ceramic/inorganic fillers (SCE). Typically, am SPE consists of a polymer matrix with an alkali metal salt, i.e., lithium salt for ASSLB applications. In addition to the previously mentioned properties, the SPEs are expected to reduce/prevent Li dendrite formation and decrease the electrode/electrolyte interface impedance thanks to an optimal contact [
