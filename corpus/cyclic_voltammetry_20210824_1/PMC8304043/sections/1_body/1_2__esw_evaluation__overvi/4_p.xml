<p>Several observations can be made based on the data presented in 
 <xref rid="materials-14-03840-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. First, based on these recent works, we can see that PEO is still one of the most investigated polymers. However, as discussed above, polymers are now rarely used alone, but are instead blended with other polymers, copolymerized, and/or filled by ceramic/inorganic fillers (Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs), SiO
 <sub>2</sub>, BaTiO
 <sub>3</sub>, MnO
 <sub>2</sub>). Another point is that even if some authors try to use new lithium salts, LiClO
 <sub>4</sub> and LiTFSI are still the most popular salts for SPE and SCE applications.
