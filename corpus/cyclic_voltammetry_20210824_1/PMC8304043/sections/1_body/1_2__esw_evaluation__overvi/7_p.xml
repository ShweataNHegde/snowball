<p>The objective is to detect at which potential the SPE or the SCE will be oxidized/reduced and, thus, degraded. Basically, when LSV is applied, after the capacitive current associated with the electrochemical double layer (which appears as soon as the potential of the electrode is changed), the oxidation (faradic current) is determined when a sudden increase of the current appears at a given potential. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-03840-f004">Figure 4</xref> shows an example of an experimental LSV profile. Depending on the authors, experimental parameters such as temperature evaluation, scanning rate, determination of the potential estimated as the beginning of the oxidation (4.7 V in this example), or the minimum current value considered as a realistic value meaning that oxidation occurs, are quite different. We need to keep in mind the non-ideal conditions when performing ESW assessment for SPEs or SCEs. An analogy with liquid electrolytes can be demonstrated. In liquid electrolytes, new species diffuse from the bulk towards the electrode. New oxidizable species will diffuse and it will become complicated to get practical limiting current values. Now for the polymeric systems, another limitation appears. Indeed, they do not diffuse, or hardly diffuse, which means no renewal of the oxidizable species is possible. This places emphasis on the amount of SPEs initially in contact with the electrode. These limitations lead to the necessity of having a large analysis area for the ESW determination of SPEs and SCEs. Thus, it is hard to point out precise values and a standard ESW evaluation method.
