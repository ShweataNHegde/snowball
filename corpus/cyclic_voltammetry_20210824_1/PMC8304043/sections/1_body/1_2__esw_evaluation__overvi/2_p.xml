<p>One of the most studied SPEs is polyethylene oxide (PEO), a polyether which attracted a lot of attention following the first reports describing its ionic conductivity in the presence of alkali metal salts [

 <xref rid="B12-materials-14-03840" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Since then, PEO-based electrolytes have undergone a lot of development and several studies based on PEO and PEO derivatives have been conducted [

 <xref rid="B16-materials-14-03840" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Throughout the years, research on non-polyether-based SPEs (alone or mixed/grafted with PEO) and composite electrolytes have been performed [

 <xref rid="B18-materials-14-03840" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-materials-14-03840" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] to overcome limitations in the ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability of PEO. SCEs are generally prepared by the dispersion of inorganic fillers in the polymer matrix to enhance the mechanical properties, the interfacial stability/compatibility, and the ionic conductivity (by decreasing the crystallinity of the polymer host) of the solid composite electrolyte.
