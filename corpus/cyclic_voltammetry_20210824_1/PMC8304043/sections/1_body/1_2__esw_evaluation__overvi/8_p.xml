<p>Cyclic voltammetry is the second most frequently used method for evaluating the ESW of SPEs or SCEs. In a typical experiment, the working electrode potential is ramped linearly versus time from the open circuit voltage to a set potential. After the set potential is reached, the working electrode’s potential is ramped back in the opposite direction to the initial potential. These cycles of potential sweeps can be repeated as many times as needed (

However, it is important to keep in mind that once the first oxidation is initiated, it is likely that during the other cycles the material has been altered due to this first oxidation. The current at the working electrode is plotted versus the applied voltage to give the cyclic voltammogram. Oxidation (positive current) and reduction (negative current) peaks can be observed if redox species react at the surface of the working electrode. These reactions can be related to the stability of the species. Especially, when analyzing electrolyte solutions and naturally for solid electrolytes such as SPEs or SCEs, the appearance of intense redox peaks at a given potential is characteristic of the occurrence of a reaction which can be related to electrolyte degradation. It is important to note that two different cells must be used for the evaluation of the anodic and the cathodic stability of the electrolyte even if some authors still use the same cell for both analyses. For instance, in their work, Piana et al. [
 <xref rid="B62-materials-14-03840" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] made the choice to evaluate the SCE (PEO/LAGP hybrid electrolyte) by scanning the cell potential from the OCV (open circuit potential) down toward −0.3 vs. Li
 <sup>+</sup>/Li and, then, upward to 2.5 V vs. Li
 <sup>+</sup>/Li (cathodic stability window) in a Li/SCE/Cu cell configuration, and from the OCV toward 5.0 V vs. Li
 <sup>+</sup>/Li and, then, downward to 2.5 V vs. Li
 <sup>+</sup>/Li (anodic stability window) in a Li/SCE/Carbon black cell configuration with a scanning rate of 0.1 mV/s. In that case, both cells use planar working electrodes (Cu and carbon black coated Al foil) for the ESW evaluation. Thus, the stability of the SPEs and SCEs can be analyzed via CV in a similar way to with LSV. The cell configuration is often identical to the one for LSV analysis and, once again, a huge range of choices about the setup of parameters like temperature and scanning rates is also observed. For instance, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-03840-f006">Figure 6</xref> shows the distribution of scanning rates used for ESW evaluation by LSV/CV taken from 
 <xref rid="materials-14-03840-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. A clear trend towards low and moderate scanning rates (0.1 to 1 mV/s) is observed. However, many other authors use higher scanning rates (&gt;5 mV/s). It must also be noted that even 1 mV/s can be considered to be a high scanning rate for ESW evaluations because of the sluggish processes involved in the degradation of solid-state electrolytes.
