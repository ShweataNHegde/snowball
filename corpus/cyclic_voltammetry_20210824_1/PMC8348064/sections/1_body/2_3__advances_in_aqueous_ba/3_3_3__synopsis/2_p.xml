<p>Combinatorial CVD-based manufacturing processes are promising alternatives for battery technology. These methods have been less utilised in this field but present the advantage of being able to achieve conformal coverage (even on high aspect-ratio substrates) and cheaper scale up in an industrial process [

In traditional CVD methods, the reagent gaseous precursors become homogeneously mixed before entering the reactor, while combinatorial CVD implements separate points of entry. The gradient in gas mixtures across the reactor induces compositional film growth, producing a single film with numerous phases and compositions, which can yield optimised functional properties and help to discover new materials [

 <xref rid="materials-14-04177-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> could be grown by a combinatorial CVD route-based multilayer approach involving the active materials in varying electrode proportions, making the whole process simple, since it would take place in one step and as a consequence be potentially very industrially competitive. Another advantage of the particular route is the optimisation of active materials morphology and particle size that could reduce the interface resistance among the electrode and electrolyte.
