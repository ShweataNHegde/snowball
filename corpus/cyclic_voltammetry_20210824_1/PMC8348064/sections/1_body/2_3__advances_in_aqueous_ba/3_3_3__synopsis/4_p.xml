<p>Currently, the cell design is limited to some standard formats including cylindrical and pouch. The acceleration of new cell designs is essential to connect the desired properties related with the cell configuration, electrode compositions, and structures. This can be achieved through modeling opening up possibilities to explore new cell formats. On this point, we should not forget to include eco-design criteria allowing the recycling of parts or materials. While this is essential for future battery technology, a discussion of these factors is beyond the scope of the work presented here.</p>
