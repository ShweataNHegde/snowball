<p>Special attention needs also to be paid at interfaces that exist between the electrode materials and electrolyte, between the electrodes and current collector, between different materials components within an electrode, etc. High-quality data from multiple approaches including experiments, testing, and modeling are required to accelerate the rational design of battery materials and interfaces. From that perspective, electrochemical analysis accompanied by for instance Raman spectroscopy to evaluate the structural changes of the electrode in various states will provide a deep understanding of the processes taking place in the interfaces. CFD studies on materials properties and interactions in numerous tests and environments could also be performed to maintain a sustainable design that will uphold robust properties and the optimum performance of the electrode per surface area in large scale for mass industrialisation. Hence, the development of both theory and experiment is a challenging way of producing the next generation of battery technologies avoiding or minimising trial and error routes.</p>
