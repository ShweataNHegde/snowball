<p>There has also been considerable attention on the production of flexible energy storage devices due to the demand for flexible, wearable, and implantable electrical devices such as intelligent bracelets and wearable sensors [

 <sup>+</sup> batteries have attracted significant attention. Nevertheless, there are no reports regarding the development and utilisation of metal oxides. It is worth noting that in 2017, Guo et al. [

 <sub>4</sub> aqueous electrolyte displayed promising performance including high power density, high flexibility, and excellent rate capability, and they can be considered suitable for wearable electrical devices. In this work, CVD was carried out to coat carbon on the as-prepared powder of NaTi

The electrochemical profile of the electrode was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements utilising a three-electrode electrochemical cell with Ag/AgCl and activated carbon film as reference and counter electrode, respectively. The specific capacity was estimated to be 45 mAh g

 <sup>−1</sup> for a potential window of 0 to −0.9 V with a capacity retention of 85% after 200 cycles.
