<p>Fluidization thermal CVD (FTCVD) routes in a kilogram-scale fluidised bed CVD reactor was utilised to grow SiO/graphite@C. This method is suitable to uniformly cover the SiO by the carbon layer, avoid particle aggregation and synthesise 1000 g SiO/graphite@C composite per batch using a small amount of methane [
 <xref rid="B56-materials-14-04177" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In a typical experiment, 300 g SiO was mixed with 700 g graphite particles for 2 h in mixer. Following this procedure, the mixture was loaded in the FTCVD at 1000 °C for 2 h at a heating speed of 10 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> in Ar atmosphere. Electrochemical tests performed in CR2032-type coin-type half batteries showed that the capacity retention of the composite (93.7%) was higher than that of the SiO (55%). The excellent properties of the composite were due to the graphite addition and carbon coating, which served as a buffer to the volume change of SiO, shortened transfer pathway, and improved diffusion coefficient of Li
