<p>Another issue that was considered was the doping for the improvement of the capacitive behaviour [

 <xref rid="B65-materials-14-04177" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. In order to study this phenomenon, AACVD was chosen because it has certain advantages over APCVD [
 <xref rid="B66-materials-14-04177" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. These include the single precursor source, which provides good molecular mixing of chemical precursors, enabling the synthesis of multi-component materials with controlled characteristics (structure and morphology), and the compatibility with high-volume manufacturing. In this work, the sample presented rod-like structures, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-04177-f004">Figure 4</xref>, which showed excellent stability after 500 continuous Li
 <sup>+</sup> intercalation/deintercalation scans. The electrochemical cell and the size of the working electrode were the same as those in [

 <xref rid="B63-materials-14-04177" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In addition, they showed a specific discharge capacity of 230 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, which is higher than the nominally pure V

 <sup>−1</sup>). On the basis of this result, AACVD provides a simple and cost-efficient way to grow vanadate bronzes with promising performance as cathodes for Li
 <sup>+</sup> batteries.
