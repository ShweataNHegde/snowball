<p>Vanadium dioxide (VO
 <sub>2</sub>) is a material that has been found to have better performance compared to the well-known V
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>5</sub>. This was explained by reference to the higher electronic conductivity and the structural stability arising from the resistance to lattice shearing during cycling [
 <xref rid="B58-materials-14-04177" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Among the various VO
 <sub>2</sub> phases, the metastable phase (VO
 <sub>2</sub>(B)) is of great interest owing to its layered structure [
 <xref rid="B59-materials-14-04177" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. It was possible to grow vanadium oxides by APCVD at 500 °C using different N
 <sub>2</sub> flow rates through the vanadyl (IV) acetylacetonate (VO(acac)
 <sub>2</sub>) bubbler [

 <sub>2</sub> (022)-oriented single phase for the highest N
 <sub>2</sub> flow rate (i.e., 2.2 L min
 <sup>−1</sup>) (

 <xref rid="B61-materials-14-04177" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Similar peaks also appeared for the lowest N
 <sub>2</sub> flow rate (i.e., 1 L min
 <sup>−1</sup>), but the peaks were broader and with lower intensity, along with new peaks at 25.4°, 29.2°, and 49.6° (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-04177-f003">Figure 3</xref>a). The three new peaks were attributed to VO
 <sub>2</sub> (B), which was the predominant phase. In addition, for the case of 1 L min
 <sup>−1</sup>, nanocrystallites and outgrowths on the coating surface were indicated, while for the 2.2 L min
 <sup>−1</sup>, nanocrystallites were predominant (
