<p>In the system described above with the VO(acac)
 <sub>2</sub> precursor [
 <xref rid="B60-materials-14-04177" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], the oxygen source could also be altered via the use of propanol and ethanol, indicating the presence of an axis textured VO
 <sub>2</sub> monoclinic phase [
 <xref rid="B63-materials-14-04177" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Electrochemical analysis in an aqueous solution with Li
 <sup>+</sup> and vanadium oxide (2.5 cm × 2.5 cm × 0.3 cm) as the working electrode in a three-electrode cell showed promising results for the as-grown sample with propanol, presenting a specific discharge capacity of 459 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> with capacity retention of 97% after 1000 scans under a specific current of 2 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>. This performance was due to the higher available active material being less dense at specific sites suggestive of a Stranski–Krastanov type of growth mechanism, as reported in [
