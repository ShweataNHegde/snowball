<p>If successful, Al
 <sup>3+</sup> batteries can make a major advancement on the energy storage industry due to the fact that Al is trivalent and hence is capable of transferring three times the charge achievable with Li
 <sup>+</sup>. There is research work on CVD for the growth of polymer but not for metal oxides. In the specific research paper, an oxidative CVD (oCVD) process can allow the oxidant and polymer monomer to react and then diffuse to the sample surface for the film formation. It was found that PEDOT on α-MnO
 <sub>2</sub>/carbon paper showed a high discharge performance with improved conductivity due to the clean charge transfer between PEDOT and α-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> as predicted by Density Functional Theory (DFT) study offering a new perspective on the catalytic activity enhancement of Al
