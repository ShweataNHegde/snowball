<p>This was basically the first report showing the viability of AACVD technology to grow V
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>5</sub> cathodes for aqueous Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> batteries. This route was further exploited to enhance the stability of the cathode by increasing the substrate temperature to 600 °C [
 <xref rid="B75-materials-14-04177" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. In this way, a mixed phase of orthorhombic and monoclinic V
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>5</sub> was produced, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-04177-f006">Figure 6</xref>a. The current-potential curves were obtained in the same cell and electrolyte as before, showing an extended stability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-04177-f006">Figure 6</xref>b) compared with the previous work [
 <xref rid="B73-materials-14-04177" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. In this case, the rate capability of the electrode exhibited a capacity retention of 100% at one order of magnitude higher specific current (15 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>) compared with the cathode grown at 500 °C (5.9 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>), as one can see in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-04177-f006">Figure 6</xref>c. Finally, the specific discharge capacity was estimated to be 300 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> with a capacity retention of 92% after 10,000 scans and coulombic efficiency of 100% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-04177-f006">Figure 6</xref>d). This enhancement may be the result of a combination of the co-existence of orthorhombic and monoclinic V
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>5</sub> along with the improved adherence of the coating.
