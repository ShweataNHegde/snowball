<p>In addition to Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> batteries, Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> has been used in other multivalent ion batteries that have been explored the last few yeas. An important advantage of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> batteries is its potential for wearable applications due to the superior flexibility, adaptability to deformation, and compatibility with the textile industry [

 <sup>+</sup> batteries. In particular, CVD was utilised for the growth of an activated 3D carbon nanotubes (CNT) conductive network followed by the electrodeposition of α-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> and finally a layer of PEDOT on the top [

 <sub>2</sub>/PEDOT cathode, homogeneous CNT branches interlinked with each other to form a net-like structure providing a high surface area and favouring the ion/electron movement. The CNT enhanced the kinetics, overcoming the inferior conductivity and mass diffusion rate of α-MnO
 <sub>2</sub>, while the PEDOT stabilised and prevented the dissolution of the structure during the cycling. Specifically, the cathode delivered a capacity of 306.1 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 1.1 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>.
