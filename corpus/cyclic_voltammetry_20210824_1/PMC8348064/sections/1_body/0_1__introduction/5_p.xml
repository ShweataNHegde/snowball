The electrochemical window cannot be extended above 1.23 V, since water begins to “split” into hydrogen and oxygen gases. However, a highly concentrated aqueous electrolyte has enabled 100% Zn plating/stripping efficiency [

In addition, the introduction of surfactant materials into the electrolyte could be beneficial in terms of inhibiting the decomposition of water, suppressing the corrosion of metal anode, and enlarging the stability window of aqueous electrolytes [
