<p>Due to the ever-increasing need for less dependence on fossil fuels, there is both a societal and technological drive towards environmentally friendly and longer-lasting energy technologies. Renewable energy technologies such as solar and wind are already reducing the usage of fossil fuels by two-thirds, and by 2030, the generation from renewable sources is expected to be cheaper [

Nevertheless, versatile and economically desirable forms of energy storage are needed to provide the energy required during the high demand times. From that perspective, the challenge for technology innovation, system integration, and efficiency is the balance estimation among energy, the environment, and the economy, as indicated in
