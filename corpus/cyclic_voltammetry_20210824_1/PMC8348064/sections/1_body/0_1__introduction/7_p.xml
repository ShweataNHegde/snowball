<p>Among the possible electrode materials, metal oxides such as V
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>5</sub>, TiO
 <sub>2</sub>, and MnO
 <sub>2</sub> have attracted a lot of interest due to their ability to form high-energy density structures, their relatively high earth abundance, and lack of any major safety or environmental issues associated with their use. The decrease of metal oxide particle size to the nanoscale level is assumed to result in larger electrode/electrolyte contact areas and the ability to more effectively accommodate the strain of cation intercalation/deintercalation in nanomaterials [

Although they have been optimised to meet the requirements of portable electronics, certain intrinsic characteristics such as fabrication cost and safety in terms of organic electrolytes utilised prevent their use as viable large-scale ESSs [
