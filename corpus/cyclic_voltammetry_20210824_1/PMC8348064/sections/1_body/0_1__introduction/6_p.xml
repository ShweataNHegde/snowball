<p>The major electrode components can be divided into three main categories. The first one is carbon materials [
 <xref rid="B22-materials-14-04177" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Graphene and chemically modified graphene sheets have shown a high electrical conductivity, high surface area, and good mechanical properties comparable with, or even better than carbon nanotubes [

 <xref rid="B24-materials-14-04177" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The second category is the transition metal oxides including MnO
 <sub>2</sub> and V
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>5</sub>, which are used for the fast and reversible redox reactions at the surface of the active material [

 <xref rid="B26-materials-14-04177" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, they usually have a high electrical resistance, resulting in a low power density. The third one is related with the conductive polymers, which suffer from a limited stability during cycling that reduces the performance when used as bulk materials [
