<p>Aqueous-based batteries (ABs) are promising solutions for large-scale applications, since a water-based battery system can be produced at relatively low cost, while they are also generally safe to use and require no use of inert atmospheres during production. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-04177-f002">Figure 2</xref> presents a schematic presentation of an aqueous battery indicating the negative electrode called anode and the positive electrode called cathode. The anode and cathode are separated by a membrane filled with electrolyte. The key difference between conventional and flow batteries is how energy is stored. Conventional batteries store energy in electrodes, while flow cells store it in electrolytes.
