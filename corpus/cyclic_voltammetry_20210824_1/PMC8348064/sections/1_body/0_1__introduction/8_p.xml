<p>Towards this direction, the battery engineers have turned their attention to fabrication process and materials [
 <xref rid="B1-materials-14-04177" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. On the one hand, an expensive fabrication process needs to be avoided for the engineering of low-cost battery cells. On the other hand, materials that require a high production cost need to become economically attractive in the coming years.
