Despite the high energy densities possible with these storage systems, safety remains an issue in security-critical applications as highlighted by incidents such as the Boeing 787 battery fires in 2013, Samsung Note 7 explosions in 2016, and Tesla Model S combustions in 2019 [

 <xref rid="B10-materials-14-04177" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Potassium presents slow diffusion kinetics in solids and yields in lower gravimetric capacities than sodium [

On the other hand, magnesium-ion batteries are reactive enough to become deactivated over time due to the strong tendency of magnesium anodes to form passivating surface films. This can be solved through the combination of magnesium with different cathodes to provide good specific capacities, but with a lower voltage compared with lithium-ion batteries (&lt;1.3 V, compared with 3.8 V for Li-ion batteries) [
