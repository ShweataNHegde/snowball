<p>From that perspective, chemical vapour deposition (CVD) offers a balance between efficiency, controllability, tunability, and excellent run-to-run repeatability in the coverage of monolayer on an adequate substrate at low operational and maintenance cost. Especially, when performed at atmospheric pressure, it is compatible with in-line manufacturing properties. Additionally, the material properties can be controlled with great accuracy by varying growth parameters such as temperature, precursor composition, and flow rate giving unique morphologies, which may then be further tuned if a solvent-based aerosol CVD process is used by varying the solvent. The importance and significance of CVD manufacturing processes are further discussed in the following sections.</p>
