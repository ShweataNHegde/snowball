<p>This review paper presents the progress made and challenges remaining for the fabrication of large-area electrode materials via a technology that is proven to be industrially competitive: that of chemical vapour deposition. This manufacturing process has both pros and cons but is shown to be capable of producing commercially viable novel electrode materials with high safety, performance, and cost reduction.</p>
