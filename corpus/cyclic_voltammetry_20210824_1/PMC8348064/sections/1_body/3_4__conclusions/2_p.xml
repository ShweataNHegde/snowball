<p>As has been shown, the fabrication of electrode materials by CVD for systems other than Li
 <sup>+</sup> has not been widely investigated. Studies on multivalent ions such as Mg
 <sup>2+</sup>, Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>, and Al
 <sup>3+</sup> are actually still in their infancy. From that perspective, it is equally important to test the electrodes in cells and evaluate their performance. It is increasingly challenging for these ions to reach high specific capacity and stability with the potential to act as inexpensive and efficient electrochemical devices.
