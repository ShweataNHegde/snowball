<p>It is believed that the progress in electrode materials innovation taking into account the safety, low cost, and large scale along with high performance will encourage the leading role of aqueous batteries. Despite the fact that Li
 <sup>+</sup> batteries are the dominating power source, the progress in post-Li
 <sup>+</sup> batteries towards a more cost-effective and safer alternative will be strengthened in the coming years.
