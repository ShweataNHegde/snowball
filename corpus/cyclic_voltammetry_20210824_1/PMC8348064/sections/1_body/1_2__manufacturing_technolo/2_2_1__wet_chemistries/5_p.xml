<p>Solâ€“gel processes are wet chemical techniques for the production of solid inorganic materials and involve a number of reactions including the hydrolysis and polycondesation of precursors that are either metal alkoxides or inorganic metal salts such as sulphates, nitrates, and chlorides. The principal disadvantage of this procedure is the removal of the organic groups from materials. In this case, slow drying along with annealing is often required, which sometimes results in nanoparticles aggregation, restricting their potential applications [
