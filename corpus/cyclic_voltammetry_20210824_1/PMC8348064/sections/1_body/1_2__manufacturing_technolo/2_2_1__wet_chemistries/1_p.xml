<p>Generally, wet-chemistry strategies are utilised for the fabrication of a broad range of materials and composites since they are simple and easily operated. Nevertheless, there are difficulties in terms of forming continuous films on certain substrates in most of the wet processes [

In addition, the roll-to-roll wet processing techniques (i.e., the slurry method) require the rigorous mixing of a highly toxic and flammable solvent solution, the casting into metallic collectors, and finally the drying procedure. From that perspective, the solvent evaporation is a high-cost industrial processing step for electrode fabrication, which adds both additional energy and time inputs into the electrode fabrication process [
