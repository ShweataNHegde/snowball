<p>Regarding the spin-coating, it is a process that is utilised extensively to deposit uniform coatings of organic materials on flat surfaces [
 <xref rid="B32-materials-14-04177" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The procedure is typically divided into four steps including the deposition, spin up, spin off, and evaporation. Evaporation of the solvent is possible during the rapid rotation. However, the highly volatile components require drying of the applied layer in order to evaporate. In addition, the size of the substrate is an obstacle. In this case, high-speed spinning is required, which is difficult to achieve, and as a consequence, the material efficiency is very low.
