<p>In all cases, the controllability of the interface between two materials (i.e., for instance graphene and metal oxides) for battery applications remains a challenge to overcome. This is because they are simply synthesised by mixing or dispersing their components (i.e., inorganic components with graphene), which however leads to a poor interfacial interaction. Hence, a good understanding of the materialsâ€™ surface chemistry is important for increasing interfacial interaction and achieving a well-defined structure of the electrode. In general, through these routes, the precise formation of well-defined structures is possible but with low productivity [
