<p>Additive manufacturing techniques such as 3D printing have directed attention to the large-scale development of components for energy applications [
 <xref rid="B39-materials-14-04177" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], since it is an inexpensive and simple fabrication method that relies on media characteristics and a three-axis motion stage to create particular structural forms [
