<p>Multivalent ion batteries such as Mg
 <sup>2+</sup>, Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>, and Al
 <sup>3+</sup> have attracted interest from researchers over the last few years due to the increased energy density arising from the presence of high-capacity multivalent metals as anodes. When comparing the monovalent with the multivalent systems, the attained capacity is higher for the multivalent systems due to the fact that multivalent ions can transfer two or three electrons per ion [
