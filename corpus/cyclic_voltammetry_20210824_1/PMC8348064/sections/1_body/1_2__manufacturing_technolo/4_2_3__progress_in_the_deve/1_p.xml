<p>The progress of aqueous battery systems has proceeded at a rapid pace and has included studies of monovalent Li

 <sup>3+</sup>. These aqueous systems show enhanced energy density and stability compared with acidic and alkaline systems, since the structure does not change significantly upon the cation intercalation/deintercalation processes [
