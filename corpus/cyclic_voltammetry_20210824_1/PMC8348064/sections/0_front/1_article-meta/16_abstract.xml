 <p>The goal of the battery research community is to reach sustainable batteries with high performance, meaning energy and power densities close to the theoretical limits, excellent stability, high safety, and scalability to enable the large-scale production of batteries at a competitive cost. In that perspective, chemical vapour deposition processes, which can operate safely under high-volume conditions at relatively low cost, should allow aqueous batteries to become leading candidates for energy storage applications. Research interest and developments in aqueous battery technologies have significantly increased the last five years, including monovalent (Li
  <sup>+</sup>, Na
  <sup>+</sup>, K
  <sup>+</sup>) and multivalent systems (Mg
  <sup>2+</sup>, Zn
  <sup>2+</sup>, Al
  <sup>3+</sup>). However, their large-scale production is still somewhat inhibited, since it is not possible to get electrodes with robust properties that yield optimum performance of the electrodes per surface area. In this review paper, we present the progress and challenges in the growth of electrodes through chemical vapour deposition at atmospheric pressure, which is one procedure that is proven to be industrially competitive. As battery systems attract the attention of many researchers, this review article might help those who work on large-scale electrical energy storage.
