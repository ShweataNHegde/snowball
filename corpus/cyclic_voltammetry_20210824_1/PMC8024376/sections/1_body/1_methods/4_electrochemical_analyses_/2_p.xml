 </sup>. S/C electrodes were prepared by mixing 80 wt% of the composite and 20 wt% of weight of polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) in N-methyl pyrrolidone. The mixture was coated on an etched Al foil (current collector) and dried at 353 K in a vacuum for 12 h. For the battery tests, the S/C electrodes, separator, electrolyte, and Ca metal anode were placed in a stainless-steel electrochemical cell holder. The electrochemical measurements were conducted at a C-rate of 0.1 C at room temperature in the voltage range of 3.2–0.5 V using a battery tester (580 Battery Test System, Scribner Associates).
