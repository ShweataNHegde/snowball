<p id="Par9">Disc-shaped working electrodes composed of Au, Pt, Cu, and SUS (with diameters of 8.0 mm) and the counter and reference comprising Ca (with sizes of diameters of 10.0 mm and diameters of 5.0 mm, respectively) were extensively polished until a metallic lustre was achieved before each use. All the electrochemical analyses were performed at room temperature with a stainless-steel electrochemical cell holder. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted at 20 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup> with the voltage ranging between − 0.4 and 4.0 V vs. Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>/Ca. Ex-situ XRD measurement was performed using an X’PERT Pro diffractometer (PANalytical) with Cu Kα radiation (wavelength λ = 1.5406 Å for K
 <sub>α1</sub> and 1.5444 Å for K
 <sub>α2</sub>).
