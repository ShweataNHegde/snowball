<p id="Par12">First, the atomic ratios of Ca, Cs, and B in CMC were determined through ICP-MS and ICP-OES (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). As the Cs/Ca ratio was less than 1/10,000, the Cs salt was almost completely converted into Ca salt. Furthermore, the Ca/B ratio was 1/21.96, which is close to the theoretically determined ratio of 1/22 in CMC (Ca[CB

 </sup>. To investigate the water content in CMC and CMC‧nH
 <sub>2</sub>O in detail, the Karl-Fischer titration method was applied for two electrolytes that were prepared from 5 mL of DME/THF (water content is less than 10 ppm) with 20 mg of CMC or CMC‧nH
 <sub>2</sub>O. The water content of CMC in DME/THF was measured as 15 ppm, while the water content of CMC‧nH
 <sub>2</sub>O in DME/THF was measured as 1178 ppm. The difference of 5 ppm in the water content would not affect battery operation; this difference can be compensated by the addition of molecular sieves to the CMC electrolyte. Upon the calculation of water content, CMC·nH
 <sub>2</sub>O can be expressed as CMC·6H
 <sub>2</sub>O, which is consistent with the heat-treatment-induced weight loss determined by thermogravimetric analysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>).
