<p id="Par16">In addition, black deposits were also observed on the glass separator after peeling it off of the Au electrode (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S11</xref>). The deposits were collected from the glass separator for SEM and EDS analysis by sticking the carbon tape onto the glass and then peeling it off. The obtained images show that the deposits comprise Ca metal and are relatively larger than those on the Au electrode (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S12</xref>). The poor adhesion to the Au electrode indicates that they easily lose contact with the electrode, resulting in the formation of dead Ca. This dead Ca formation and the electrolyte reduction at low potentials could cause the insufficient Coulombic efficiency during the Ca plating/stripping processes.
