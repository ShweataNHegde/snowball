 </sup>. As the weakly coordinating solvents, THF, DME, and a mixture of DME/THF (1:1, v/v) were selected, and the solubilities of CMC were evaluated by ICP-OES using saturated solutions. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d shows photographs of 5 mg CMC dissolved or dispersed in 1 mL of solvent. Interestingly, although the solubilities of CMC in DME and THF were very low (&lt; 0.0033 and 0.0026 M, respectively), that in DME/THF was high (&gt; 0.75 M). An investigation of the solubility behaviour of CMC in THF and DME binary mixtures was carried out at room temperature, where Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e shows the solubility diagram of CMC in DME/THF mixed solvents of various ratios. The highest solubility in the diagram is observed at a solvent ratio of approximately 1/1 (v/v). Similar improvements in solubility have been reported by using mixed solvents for several salts containing cluster-type complex hydride anions, such as Mg(CB

These conductivities were determined using a symmetrical cell with an Au electrode with the cell constant obtained via cell calibration using 0.08% KCl and were used to calculate the conductivity of the electrolyte. The calculated conductivity of 0.5 M CMC/DME/THF (4.0 mS cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) was greater than those of CMC/DME (0.073 mS cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) and CMC/THF (0.036 mS cm
