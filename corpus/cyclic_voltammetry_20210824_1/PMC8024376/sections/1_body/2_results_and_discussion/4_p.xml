<p id="Par15">To provide direct evidence for Ca ionic conduction through the CMC/DME/THF electrolyte, we assembled a Ca | CMC/DME/THF | Au cell and deposited Ca on the Au electrode at room temperature. In the disassembled cell, the deposits appeared as black powder on the Au electrode, which was washed with DME/THF (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). The black powder on the Au electrode and separator was removed and collected for XRD measurement, which revealed that the dominant product is Ca metal in the form of α-Ca and β-Ca, along with a small amount of CaH
 <sub>2</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S9</xref>). These broad peaks with a low intensity indicate a small size and a low crystallinity for all deposited materials. Then, the morphology of the deposits on the Au electrodes in CMC/DME/THF electrolyte were examined using SEM and EDS, and showed uniformly dispersed spherical particles (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b,c, and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S10</xref>). The spherical particle deposits have a shape similar to that of the Ca deposits prepared in the Ca(BH
 <sub>4</sub>)

 <sub>4</sub>–THF electrolyte

 </sup>. The EDS profile indicates that the deposits were mainly composed of Ca, O and C with trace amounts of B (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). The large amount of O originated from the highly reactive fresh Ca deposits being briefly exposed to air before the EDS observation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). The moderate amounts of C and B were likely due to electrolyte reduction at low potentials or residual CMC. The Ca weight ratio in a typical particle was calculated as 84% when contribution of Au content was eliminated. Accordingly, we concluded that the charge carrier in this system is Ca.
