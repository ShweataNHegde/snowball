<p id="Par5">Herein, we propose a fluorine-free Ca electrolyte using calcium monocarborane (CMC or Ca[CB
 <sub>11</sub>H
 <sub>12</sub>]
 <sub>2</sub>), which shows a wide electrochemical potential window up to 4 V vs. Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>/Ca and high conductivity of 4 mS cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, in addition to supporting reversible Ca metal plating/stripping at room temperature. The monocarborane cluster anion ([CB
 <sub>11</sub>H
 <sub>12</sub>]
 <sup>−</sup>) is a type of complex hydride anion, which is known as a weakly coordinating anion

 </sup>. Moreover, due to its high reductive and oxidative stability, it allows for a wide potential window and shows excellent stability against metal anodes such as Li, Na, and Mg

 </sup>. These led to the idea that an electrolyte with the [CB

 <sub>12</sub>]
 <sup>−</sup> anion could also be highly compatible with Ca batteries. However, a design that incorporates a monocarborane cluster anion into a Ca electrolyte has not been proposed. In fact, the results of this study reveal that electrolytes prepared by simply adding a CMC salt to single DME or THF solvents show poor solubility and deliver insufficient electrochemical performance. Hence, we found that a DME/THF mixed solvent shows high solubility for the CMC salt and delivers excellent electrochemical performances in Ca batteries.
