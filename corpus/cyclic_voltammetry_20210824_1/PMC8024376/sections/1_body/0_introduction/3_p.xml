<p id="Par4">More recently, Li et al. and Shyamsunder et al. simultaneously demonstrated that room-temperature reversible Ca plating/stripping using an electrolyte of Ca[B(hfip)
 <sub>4</sub>]
 <sub>2</sub> (hfip = hexafluoroisopropyloxy) in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) was possible with impressive anodic stability (&gt; 4.0 V)

 </sup>. The [B(hfip)
 <sub>4</sub>] anion is known to be a weakly coordinating anion with weak anion–cation interactions, thereby favouring ion association and higher conductivities

 <sub>2</sub> formation as the Ca(BF

 <sub>2</sub> electrolyte. Wang et al. proposed Ca(BH

 <sub>2</sub> in tetrahydrofuran (THF) as a fluorine-free electrolyte system, which showed a Coulombic efficiency of 95% during Ca plating/stripping on an Au electrode

 </sup>. Thus, it is desirable to find a fluorine-free Ca electrolyte system that delivers high electrochemical performance, i.e. a wide electrochemical potential window, reversible Ca plating/stripping stability, and high ionic conductivity at room temperature.
