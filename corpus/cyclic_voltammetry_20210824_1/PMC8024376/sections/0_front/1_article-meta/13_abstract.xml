 <p id="Par1">High-energy-density and low-cost calcium (Ca) batteries have been proposed as ‘beyond-Li-ion’ electrochemical energy storage devices. However, they have seen limited progress due to challenges associated with developing electrolytes showing reductive/oxidative stabilities and high ionic conductivities. This paper describes a calcium monocarborane cluster salt in a mixed solvent as a Ca-battery electrolyte with high anodic stability (up to 4 V vs. Ca
  <sup>2+</sup>/Ca), high ionic conductivity (4 mS cm
  <sup>−1</sup>), and high Coulombic efficiency for Ca plating/stripping at room temperature. The developed electrolyte is a promising candidate for use in room-temperature rechargeable Ca batteries.
