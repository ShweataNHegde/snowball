<p>The RRDE experiments were conducted in a usual H‐Cell under argon atmosphere. The Au working electrode (WE), Au counter electrode (CE) and Ag reference electrode (RE) were connected to a bipotentiostat (TACUSSEL BIPAD B1), while electrode rotator was connected to a PINE rotation control. Counter electrode was a gold sheet and the reference electrode was a silver wire immersed into 0.1
