<p>DEMS measurements were conducted using a dual thin‐layer flow‐through cell, where WE, CE and RE were connected to a homebuilt bipotentiostat. The electrolyte outlet was connected to a peristaltic pump (SPETEL Perimax). The CEs were gold wires and the RE was a silver wire immersed into 0.1 
 <sc>m</sc> AgNO
 <sub>3</sub> in DMSO. The RE was contacted to the working electrolyte via a Teflon tube (sealed with a rough glass bead) filled with the silver containing solution. The end of the glass bead was immersed into the working electrolyte, while the open end was immersed into the RE electrolyte. The size of the thin‐layer compartment of the WE and of the compartment of the porous Teflon membrane (serving as the interface to the vacuum) were defined by a Teflon spacer of 200 μm and 100 μm thickness and a diameter of 6 mm (electrode area of 0.283 cm
 <sup>2</sup>), as in our previous study.
