<p>A disc‐type Au(111) single crystal (diameter: 10 mm; thickness: 3 mm) purchased from MaTecK GmbH was used as working electrode. Gold and platinum wires were used as counter and quasi‐reference (Pt/PtO) electrodes, respectively. The standard sealed chamber (Agilent 5500) was purged with Ar before transferring the AFM cell. After the AFM‐cell filled with electrolyte was loaded on the AFM, Ar was purged for around 10 min because the AFM‐cell was exposed to the atmosphere during assembling and transfer. O
 <sub>2</sub> was purged during the experiment to maintain the concentration of oxygen in the electrolyte (100 % oxygen saturation). Sharp silicon tips (PPP‐CONTSC, tip radius &lt;10 nm) were used with normal spring constants of 0.1±0.05 N/m. For AFM measurements the single crystals were prepared by flame annealing.
