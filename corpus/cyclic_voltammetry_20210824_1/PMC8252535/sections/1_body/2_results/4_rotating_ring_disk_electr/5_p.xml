 <xref rid="cssc202100364-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9</xref> is an extract of Figure S2, showing the CV after the Au electrode is covered with this thin, but closed CaO
 <sub>2</sub>/CaO film starting from the hold potential of −0.75 V in cathodic direction (dashed line) and a CV (solid line) after the electrode is regenerated during the consecutively opening of the upper potential limit to +0.7 V. (Simply cycling to positive potentials (above 0.3 V) to desorb the adsorbate layer also would have been sufficient). But the approach used here (Figure S2) further shows that the electrode begins to slowly reactivate as the upper limit reaches 0.3 V, which indicates 0.3 V as the potential required for CaO
 <sub>2</sub>/CaO adsorbate oxidation. Note that in the first sweeps up to 0.4 V oxidation of this adsorbate is slow and remains incomplete, whereas in subsequent sweeps the maximum current is at 0.25 V (peak potential). This indicates a nucleation and growth behavior for the free sites, as observed earlier for Ca
