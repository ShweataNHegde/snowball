<p>Qualitatively it is already obvious from the size of the peroxide formation current, which is much larger than the oxidation peak at the disc at 0.3 V that peroxide does not accumulate at the disc electrode (at least under convection) but rather dissolves. To confirm this more quantitatively, and to separate the superoxide and peroxide contributions, we use Figure

 <xref rid="cssc202100364-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a–c, the obtained charge densities (referring to the geometrical surface area) are 6987 μC cm
 <sup>−2</sup> (4 Hz), 7998 μC cm
 <sup>−2</sup> (9 Hz) and 8332 μC cm
 <sup>−2</sup> (16 Hz; this only provides a rough estimate of the peroxide contribution). Comparing these values with the peroxide oxidation charge densities at the disk (evaluated from the anodic and cathodic scan prior to the steep increase in disk current close to the upper potential limit) – 1045 μC cm
 <sup>−2</sup> (4 Hz), 1215 μC cm
 <sup>−2</sup> (9 Hz) and 1338 μC cm
 <sup>−2</sup> (16 Hz) – it is evident that most of the peroxide that is formed while the adsorbate layer is incomplete is dissolving. The discrepancy between peroxide formation and oxidation charge is even much larger as exclusively peroxide is formed on roughened electrodes. The OER charge on smooth polycrystalline Au electrodes without convection is larger than the values under convection, owing to the contribution of undissolved bulk CaO
 <sub>2</sub> to OER, which is mostly dissolved under convection.
