<p>Concerning the decrease of peroxide formation rate during ORR at smooth electrodes and transition to the 1 electron superoxide formation, we had suggested that the electrode is slowly covered by an adsorbate (CaO
 <sub>2</sub> or CaO), which not only completely blocks peroxide formation, but also inhibits superoxide formation to some extent as it becomes a thin, closed layer.

 </xref> To confirm this we conducted an RRDE experiment, where the Au electrode was first saturated with this CaO
 <sub>2</sub>/CaO adsorbate by holding the potential at −1.6 V during the scan for 5 min at 9 Hz rotation frequency. As the CaO
 <sub>2</sub>/CaO layer forms at this potential, superoxide formation becomes predominant as visual by the current decreasing to a constant value of −265 μA cm
 <sup>−2</sup> (i. e., 50 % of the initial current). To exclude a thick layer of CaO
 <sub>2</sub> deposit as being the reason for the inhibiting effects, the disk potential was then stepped to −0.75 V (just before ORR region) to dissolve possibly formed multilayers for 10 min (still at 9 Hz rotation frequency). After this procedure the Au surface is only covered with a CaO
 <sub>2</sub>/CaO adsorbate layer (as the thick deposit is dissolved) and CVs were recorded starting in cathodic direction, consecutively opening the anodic limit from −0.75 V to +0.7 V (see Figure S2).
