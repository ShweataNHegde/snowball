<p>The reason for this behavior is the formation of a CaO
 <sub>2</sub> or CaO adsorbate on gold electrodes that inhibits further peroxide formation during ORR as soon as it forms a closed layer; instead, superoxide is formed at defects of this layer. Its formation requires more time at rough electrodes because it competes with peroxide formation and is diffusion limited. (For a roughness of 50, its formation would thus take 50 times as long as for a roughness of 1.) At Au single crystal electrodes, on the other hand, its formation is much slower probably because nucleation sites are missing. At smooth electrodes, this adsorbate layer ultimately is sufficiently defect – free to also inhibit superoxide formation, whereas at rough electrodes such a poisoning could not be observed. On Pt electrodes, the behavior is somewhat different, as already shown in Ref. [21, 22]. This will be examined in more detail in a forthcoming paper.
