<p id="p0065">Inexpensive consumer electronics have likewise made instrumental design not only accessible for graduate curriculum, but also undergraduate and even high school classrooms. Multiple designs for home-built, inexpensive potentiostats, the instruments required for three-electrode measurements that are central to electrochemistry, are freely available (

Chemists and chemical engineers are often not exposed to circuits as part of a core undergraduate curriculum and benefit from learning to read circuit diagrams, understanding the electrical response of operational amplifiers, resistors, and capacitors, and using this knowledge to build a potentiostat. Although many commercially available potentiostats come with software packages which include a variety of useful analytical and modeling tools, direct coding of these procedures in LabView, MATLAB, or Python is a useful exercise for solidifying concepts and practicing coding languages. While learning electrochemistry, opportunities to develop practical skills that are important not only in academia, but are also critical for industrial scientists and engineers, are numerous.
