<p id="p0075">Laboratories that incorporate statistical methods and design-of-experiments concepts will better prepare scientists and engineers who aim to transition to careers in electrochemical industry. Students are quite familiar with 
 <italic>time</italic> constraints on the number of experiments they can perform but are less familiar with 
 <italic>resource</italic> constraints. Practical exposure to large datasets is rarely encountered in teaching laboratories, but electrochemical experiments are readily designed for combinatorial, “high-throughput” chemistry (

 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Parkinson, 2010</xref>). Developing an understanding of statistical methods is in itself a challenge, so students will benefit most from this type of laboratory curriculum when accompanied by lecture material, which could be pre-recorded, on statistics and design of experiments.
