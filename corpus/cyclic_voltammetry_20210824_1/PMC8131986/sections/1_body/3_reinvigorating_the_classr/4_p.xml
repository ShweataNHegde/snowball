<p id="p0070">Finite element simulation methods are well developed and can be implemented on a personal computer, even for relatively complicated electrochemical systems. Concurrent simulations and laboratory courses are mutually beneficial. Laboratory coursework informs simulations by providing students with practical experience with systems; simulations coursework informs laboratories by forcing students to understand and apply appropriate governing equations and boundary conditions for processes they carry out in the laboratory. New questions arise from features of the experimental data that are not reproduced in the simulation results, prompting students to think critically about their measurements and assumptions of the models. Furthermore, visualization of time-variant mass-transport processes occurring at the micro and nanoscales is nearly impossible without the assistance of simulations. Animations or videos of these processes in lectures increase accessibility of the material. Instructors can make use of software like COMSOL, or other simpler mathematics packages, to create manipulatable applications that students can use to explore and understand limits and parameter spaces.</p>
