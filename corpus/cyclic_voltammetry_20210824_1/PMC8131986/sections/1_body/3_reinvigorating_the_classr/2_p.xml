<p id="p0060">Flipped classrooms, where students participate in lectures on their own time and work through problems in class, are often found to increase student engagement with the textbook (

Meta-analyses of courses that include online and active-learning components have shown positive correlations with improved engagement, increased test scores, and decreased failure rates, independent of either student quality or instructor identity (

Outcomes have not yet been quantified for electrochemistry education, but our experience suggests a judicious mix of pre-recorded and live content delivery to be useful. The pre-recorded content allows students to review key material and address gaps in understanding (e.g., electrostatics, thermodynamics) on their own time while simultaneously enabling instructors to supervise and model the problem-solving process when introducing new examples in the classroom. Recorded video lectures have the added benefit of broadening the impact of specialized electrochemistry courses at the graduate level, which can be made available to a global audience.
