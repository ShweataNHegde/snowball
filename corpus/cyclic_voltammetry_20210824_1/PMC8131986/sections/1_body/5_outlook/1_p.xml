<p id="p0115">Electrochemistry as a field is growing at a tremendous rate. It was central to the emergence of chemistry as a discipline through the discovery of elements, and is now poised to revolutionize energy, neuroscience, and organic synthesis, among more traditional applications in corrosion prevention and electrodeposition. A reinvigoration of electrochemical education is important to support emerging industries with the talent they need and will ensure the rigor of the rapidly growing literature that reports electrochemical data.</p>
