<p id="p0080">At the graduate level, electrochemistry-related courses might include an electroanalytical-focused course taught in the chemistry department, an engineering-focused course, perhaps an energy technology course, and in rare cases, a course in corrosion. Usually, these courses are not coordinated and overlap in material is common. Courses taught with laboratory experiences, simulations, and/or practical skills are typically missing. Within the Oregon Center for Electrochemistry, we have developed an accelerated graduate program focused on electrochemical technology and a related program is being planned at UC Irvine (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The Oregon program is distinguished from traditional electrochemistry education by tight integration of laboratory, simulation, and practical skills. Students at the master’s level complete six months of intense coursework before a nine-month internship in industry or a national laboratory doing electrochemical research and development that completes the degree. Students in the PhD program take a subset of the courses depending on their interests as they start their PhD research.
