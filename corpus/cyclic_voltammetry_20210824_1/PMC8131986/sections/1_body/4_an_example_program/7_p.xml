<p id="p0110">As a “capstone” to the on-campus curriculum, students in the Oregon Master’s program take a projects course where they join as teams (2–4 students) to solve open-ended research and development projects in electrochemistry. The applied research and development projects for the course come from industry and academic or national laboratory partners. This allows the students to develop skills solving unstructured problems representative of what they will face in their careers. One example in the first year of the program included building alkaline-membrane electrolyzers with earth-abundant oxygen-evolution catalysts and understanding the design parameters that drive energy efficiency and durability that are currently unknown in the field. Senior PhD students with expertise in the project content typically mentor and work with the teams of electrochemistry Master’s students. The outputs are formal reports to the industry sponsor and/or academic peer-reviewed publications where the students are co-authors. The students also learn to use materials characterization tools such as electron and atomic-force microscopies to augment electrochemical analyses.</p>
