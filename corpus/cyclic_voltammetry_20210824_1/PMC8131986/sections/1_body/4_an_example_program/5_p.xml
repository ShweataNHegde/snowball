<p id="p0100">At the Oregon Center for Electrochemistry, both the lecture and laboratory content runs parallel to a course in numerical simulation of electrochemical systems, currently taught using the commercial COMSOL package. The course emphasizes (1) understanding the math and physics principles underlying finite-element numerical simulation, (2) constructing robust electrochemical models, including defining boundary conditions, interfaces, transport, kinetics, and thermodynamic model inputs, and (3) interpreting data from numerical simulations in the context of a simple physical picture to develop electrochemical intuition. Example projects include polarization of an inert electrolyte and formation of a double layer, diffusion-controlled voltammetry, and cyclic voltammetry with planar and radial geometries. Students also perform an independent project to apply their skills in an area of interest, for example, batteries.</p>
