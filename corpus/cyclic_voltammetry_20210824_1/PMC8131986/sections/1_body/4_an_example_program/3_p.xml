<p id="p0090">The graduate level course at UC Irvine is structured similarly to the above outline but has historically also included a larger lecture, and laboratory, component on thermodynamic activity and its application to underpotential deposition, liquid-junction potentials, membrane potentials, and ion-selective electrode. Each student is required to give a 10–15 min presentation on an application or technique that aims to bridge concepts, knowledge, and nomenclature learned in the course to their particular topic and to critically evaluate a recent peer-reviewed publication related to it, in lieu of extensive lecture material covering applications of electrochemistry and several techniques.</p>
