<p id="p0095">Both lecture courses are coupled tightly with laboratory courses (two three-hour sessions per week at Oregon and one two-hour session per week at UC Irvine). The laboratories focus on typical three-electrode electrochemical experiments and techniques that form the basis for analytical electrochemistry and build basic electrochemistry knowledge and intuition with respect to thermodynamics, kinetics, and mass transport. Students learn practical skills such as circuit design and electrode preparation. Laboratory modules include building a potentiostat, potential-step and potentiometric measurements, deposition and Tafel analysis of heterogeneous electrocatalysts, cyclic voltammetry of soluble species, and impedance spectroscopy and analysis. Instead of writing laboratory reports, the students in the Oregon Center for Electrochemistry submit Python notebooks, which makes it possible to evaluate and provide feedback on the process of data work up and analysis while teaching valuable programming skills. Additional laboratories at UC Irvine have explored ion-selective electrodes and liquid-junction potentials. Students have historically analyzed and interpreted their results to connect them more broadly to the physical processes occurring in their experiments supported by numerical simulations.</p>
