<p id="p0105">The second term of the core electrochemistry graduate program at Oregon focuses on engineering and devices. A lecture course on electrochemical engineering follows Fuller and Harb, with emphasis on porous electrode theory, batteries and battery packs, fuel cells and systems, corrosion, electrodeposition, and industrial electrolysis. Lectures are tightly coupled with a substantial laboratory course that applies the concepts learned in the lecture while also emphasizing practical skills that are valuable in careers, including numerical simulations, programming, and design of experiments. Students work in small teams to build Li-ion battery devices, water electrolyzers, and fuel cells. They test the performance and response of these devices compared to theory and modeling, applying experimental design and statistical analysis methods. Laboratory projects also include those focused on electrodeposition and corrosion. Open laboratory times are typically established for students to work in teams at their own pace and on their own schedule on the assigned projects, after appropriate safety training and with oversight and mentoring as needed. For both the lecture and laboratory engineering and device courses, feedback from industry partners drives content evolution to keep the courses relevant.</p>
