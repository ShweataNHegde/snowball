<p id="p0020">Teaching electrochemistry is a challenge. Chemists familiar with homogeneous chemical reactions in beakers and flasks must translate their experience to heterogeneous reactions at interfaces while learning the fundamentals of transport and strengthening physics concepts such as electrostatics. Understanding electrochemical instrumentation and troubleshooting electrochemical cells requires an understanding of amplifier and feedback circuits. Students must be proficient in differential equations and multivariable calculus to develop foundational understanding of the relationships among thermodynamics, kinetics, and transport. As a result, most dedicated courses in electrochemistry are at the graduate level and build on assumed prior exposure to chemical kinetics, electrostatics, thermodynamics, and mass-transfer; topics from courses that span many departments and thus are unlikely to be mastered by any single entry-level graduate student.</p>
