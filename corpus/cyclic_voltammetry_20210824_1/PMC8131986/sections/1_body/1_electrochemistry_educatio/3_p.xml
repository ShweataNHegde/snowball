<p id="p0030">Despite the diversity of approaches and subject matter in the texts above, a few topics have been neglected. Ion-conducting polymers (ionomers) are implemented in electrolyzers, fuel cells, solid-state batteries, and dialysis, but are mostly introduced in the context of a specific application and rarely provided an independent section. Thoughtful reviews are available to instructors (
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Meyer, 1998</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Kusoglu and Weber, 2017</xref>), but dedicated chapters covering the structure and function of ionomers have yet to appear in electrochemistry textbooks (
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Strathmann, 2010</xref>). Lastly, with the dramatic decreases in the costs of microelectronics, inexpensive potentiostats are now readily available for teaching. Simple descriptions of how electrodes and cells are assembled and tested in the laboratory would be a welcome addition to future textbooks to augment more detailed compendiums on practical electrochemical methods (
