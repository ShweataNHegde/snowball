<p id="p0035">For all its challenges, electrochemistry provides a rich set of opportunities to introduce chemists, physicists, and engineers to instrumental analysis, multiscale modeling, and device design, while solidifying their understanding of core thermodynamics, kinetics, transport, and materials-science concepts. To avoid misconceptions in introductory courses, it is important to expose students to a broad variety of examples: electrolytic and galvanic cells, solid and liquid conducting electrolytes, and processes occurring over multiple length-scales (

 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Subramanian and Braatz, 2010</xref>). Learning such breadth of content may be facilitated by experiences in the laboratory. A ten-week experience in fuel-cell engineering at the University of Washington serves as an example of electrochemistry as a platform for teaching a variety of interdisciplinary concepts (

Similar experiences tailored toward a survey of electrochemical devices could help solidify concepts from lecture courses, mitigate common mistakes related to potentials and ionic current, and expand career opportunities for appropriately trained graduates. Gaps in the current way electrochemistry is commonly taught at the graduate level include introductions to cell configurations of interest to electrochemical industry (
