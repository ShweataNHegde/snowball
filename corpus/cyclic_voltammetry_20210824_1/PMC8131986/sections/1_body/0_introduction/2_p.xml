<p id="p0015">Despite the vital role of electrochemistry in the future of diverse industries, education in electrochemical science, engineering, and technology is lacking across US universities. At the undergraduate level, science and engineering students usually see only a brief introduction to electrochemistry in their general chemistry courses. Graduate students in PhD programs may have access to one course, typically focused on electroanalytical chemistry. Several universities offer an electrochemical engineering course, but rarely are the two courses coordinated. Given the importance of electrochemical science, engineering, and technology to the prosperity of human civilization, electrochemistry education deserves a reinvigoration and reinvention to meet the needs of the 21
 <sup>st</sup> century.
