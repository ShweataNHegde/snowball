<p id="p0040">Misconceptions and misunderstandings are rife in the field of electrochemistry. The equations behind electrochemical equilibria are often simple to introduce but difficult for students, and many practitioners, to fully understand and appropriately apply. Generally, equilibrium between phases – such as the electrode and solution – is determined by the concept of the “electrochemical potential” which brings together electric potentials from electrostatics with chemical potentials as determined by the Gibbs free energy used in chemistry (

Students must be comfortable with the use of reference states and the difference between intensive and extensive properties before being tasked with deriving cell potentials. Because half-cell potentials are intimately tied to laboratory measurements and the concept of a reference reaction/electrode, students benefit from practical experience, measuring standard potentials for themselves. It is often overlooked that all measured half-cell potentials are in fact full-cell potentials measured versus a reference electrode/state, a point that helps one conceptualize the initial and final states of the electron in all coupled redox reactions. With this knowledge, it becomes clear how measurements of half-cell potentials include contributions to differences in electric potential in the electrolyte between the electrode of interest and its reference state, such as membrane potentials, liquid-junction potentials across frits, and ohmic potential drops due to uncompensated resistance when current is flowing. Notably, the widespread use of cyclic voltammetry in chemistry research to approximate thermodynamic standard-state solution potentials oftentimes leads to a misunderstanding of the differences in standard-state and actual electrode and solution potentials.
