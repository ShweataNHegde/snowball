<p id="p0045">Extending measurements of the equilibrium cell potential to non-equilibrium situations where current is flowing introduces new challenges. Students often struggle to balance the current carried by electrons with ions carrying the charge through the electrolyte (

 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Sanger and Greenbowe, 1999</xref>). Exposure to chemically reversible cells, such as rechargeable batteries, help prevent misconceptions about the relationship between positive and negative electrodes to cell anodes and cathodes and the direction of ionic current. Furthermore, students should be provided opportunities to directly assess the contributions of convection, diffusion, and migration to mass transport required for sustained currents. At the graduate level, students struggle to understand the various contributions to the overpotential under current flow and how those develop across interfaces and through the cell. Issues with connecting overpotentials to the spatial dependence of the electrochemical potential, chemical potential, and electric potential are carried over into the published electrochemical literature. Laboratory experiences to explore these concepts could work hand-in-hand with analytical and numerical modeling of transport and electron-transfer processes.
