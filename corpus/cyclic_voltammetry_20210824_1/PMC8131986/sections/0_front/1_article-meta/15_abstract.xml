 <title>Summary</title>
 <p>Electrochemistry is an established discipline with modern frontiers spanning energy conversion and storage, neuroscience, and organic synthesis. In spite of the expanding opportunities for academic and industrial electrochemists, particularly in the growing energy-storage sector, rigorous training of electrochemists is generally lacking at academic institutions in the United States. In this perspective, we highlight the core concepts of electrochemistry and discuss ways in which it has been historically taught. We identify challenges faced when teaching inherently interdisciplinary electrochemical concepts and discuss how technology provides new tools for teaching, such as inexpensive electronics and open-source software, to help address these challenges. Finally, we outline example programs and discuss how new tools and approaches can be brought together to prepare scientists and engineers for careers in electrochemical technology where they can accelerate the research, development, and deployment of the clean energy technology essential to combat climate change in the coming decades.</p>
