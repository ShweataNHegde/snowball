The rich possibilities for the tailoring of organic molecules and the possibility to discover active materials of lower cost and decreased environmental impact continue to drive research and development of organic compounds suitable for redox flow battery applications. In this work, we focus on the characterization of aromatic molecules with 1,4-diaza groups for flow battery applications. We examine the influence of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents and the effect of the relative position of the substituent(s) on the molecule. We found that electron-withdrawing substituents increased the potential, while electron-donating decreased it, in agreement with expectations. The number of carboxy-groups on the pyrazinic ring was found to have a strong impact on the heterogeneous electron transfer kinetics, with the slowest kinetics observed for pyrazine-2,3,5,6-tetracarboxylic acid. The stability of quinoxaline was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and in a flow cell configuration. Substitution at the 2,3-positions in quinoxaline was found to decrease the capacity fade rate significantly. Furthermore, we demonstrated how molecular aggregation reduces the effective number of electrons involved in the redox process for quinoxalines.

The rich possibilities for the tailoring of organic molecules and the possibility to discover active materials of lower cost and decreased environmental impact continue to drive research and development of organic compounds suitable for redox flow battery applications. In this work, we focus on the characterization of aromatic molecules with 1,4-diaza groups for flow battery applications. We examine the influence of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents and the effect of the relative position of the substituent(s) on the molecule. We found that electron-withdrawing substituents increased the potential, while electron-donating decreased it, in agreement with expectations. The number of carboxy-groups on the pyrazinic ring was found to have a strong impact on the heterogeneous electron transfer kinetics, with the slowest kinetics observed for pyrazine-2,3,5,6-tetracarboxylic acid. The stability of quinoxaline was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and in a flow cell configuration. Substitution at the 2,3-positions in quinoxaline was found to decrease the capacity fade rate significantly. Furthermore, we demonstrated how molecular aggregation reduces the effective number of electrons involved in the redox process for quinoxalines. This translates to a significant reduction of the achievable volumetric capacity at higher concentrations, yielding values significantly lower than the theoretical capacity.

The described process is a simple, one-step synthesis with little to no side products. The synthesized materials showed an irregular, porous structure, with an average pore size of 3.44-3.61 nm (total pore volume (BJH)) and a multi-layer structure and a developed specific surface area at the level of 586-660 m<sup>2</sup>/g (analysis of specific surface Area (BET)). On the external surfaces, the occurrence of irregular particles with a size of 0.5 to 10 \u00b5m was observed, most probably the effect of doping the graphene structure and the formation of sp<sup>3</sup> hybridization defects. The obtained materials show the ability to store electric charge due to the development of the specific surface area.

batteries. Herein, a stretchable solid electrolyte comprised of crosslinked elastic polymer matrix, poly(vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP), and flameproof triethyl phosphate (TEP) is fabricated, which exhibits ultrahigh elongation of 450%, nonflammability and ionic conductivity above 1 mS cm<sup>-1</sup>. In addition, in order to improve the interface compatibility between the electrolyte and Li anode and stabilize the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI), a protecting layer containing poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) is designed to effectively prevent the anode from reacting with TEP and optimize the chemical composition in SEI, leading to a tougher and more stable SEI on the anode.

Even at a high C-rate of 3 C, the S/3DOM ZnO composite still provided a high capacity of 651 mAh g<sup>-1</sup>, as well as a high areal capacity (4.47 mAh cm<sup>-2</sup>) under high loading (5 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>).", "Keywords": ["Strong Adsorption", "Lithium\u2013sulfur Battery", "Fast Redox Kinetics", "Three-dimensionally Ordered Macroporous Zno"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7697050?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)", "authorinfo": ["Han H", "Wang T", "Zhang Y", "Nurpeissova A", "Bakenov Z"], "title": "Three-Dimensionally Ordered Macroporous ZnO Framework as Dual-Functional Sulfur Host for High-Efficiency Lithium-Sulfur Batteries."}, "PMC7988023": {"downloaded": false, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": false, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "33759059", "source": "MED", "pmid": "33759059", "pmcid": "PMC7988023", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC7988023"}, "doi": "10.1186/s11671-021-03508-z", "title": "Improving Cyclability of Lithium Metal Anode via Constructing Atomic Interlamellar Ion Channel for Lithium Sulfur Battery.", "authorString": "Yang M, Jue N, Chen Y, Wang Y.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Yang M", "firstName": "Mao", "lastName": "Yang", "initials": "M", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, 610054, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Jue N", "firstName": "Nan", "lastName": "Jue", "initials": "N", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, 610054, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Chen Y", "firstName": "Yuanfu", "lastName": "Chen", "initials": "Y", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, 610054, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Wang Y", "firstName": "Yong", "lastName": "Wang", "initials": "Y", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, 610054, China. ywang@uestc.edu.cn."}}}]}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "1", "volume": "16", "journalIssueId": "3122310", "dateOfPublication": "2021 Mar", "monthOfPublication": "3", "yearOfPublication": "2021", "printPublicationDate": "2021-03-01", "journal": {"title": "Nanoscale research letters", "ISOAbbreviation": "Nanoscale Res Lett", "medlineAbbreviation": "Nanoscale Res Lett", "NLMid": "101279750", "ISSN": "1931-7573", "ESSN": "1556-276X"}}, "pubYear": "2021", "pageInfo": "52", "abstractText": "Uniform migration of lithium (Li) ions between the separator and the lithium anode is critical for achieving good quality Li deposition, which is of much significance for lithium metal battery operation, especially for Li-sulfur (Li-S) batteries.
