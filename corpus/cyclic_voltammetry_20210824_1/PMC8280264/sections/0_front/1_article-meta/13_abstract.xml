 <p id="Par10">Herein, the ferrocene redox indicator-based surface film characteristics of spinel lithium manganese oxide (LMO) were evaluated. The pre-cycling of spinel LMO generated a film on the LMO surface. The surface film deposited on LMO surface suppresses further electrolyte decomposition, while the penetration of approximately 0.7 nm-sized redox indicator is not prevented. The facile self-discharge of LMO and regeneration current from the ferrocenium molecule was observed from the redox indicator in a specifically designed four-electrode cell. From this electrochemical behavior, a small-sized HF molecule attack on the LMO surface through a carbonate-based electrolyte-derived film is defined; hence, the prevention of small-sized molecules into the deposited surface film is crucial for the enhancement of LiMn
