 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the cyclic voltammogram of Fc on the bare LMO electrode surface. The prerequisites of the redox indicator are summarized as follows: first, the chemical reversibility of the redox couple in carbonate-based electrolyte; this is because the oxidized redox couple migrates to the counter mesh electrode, thereby demonstrating the redox current. Second is the redox potential of the redox indicator. The redox indicator should easily be oxidized on the LMO surface (approximately 4.0 V 
 <italic>vs</italic>. Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup>) and reduced on the current-collecting electrode surface (3.0 V 
 <italic>vs</italic>. Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup>). The prerequisites were evaluated by CV. Fc is known to be highly reversible in non-aqueous media, and thus, it is evaluated as a redox indicator for the LMO electrode. The electrochemical characteristics of Fc were measured to evaluate its reversible characteristics in carbonate electrolytes and its redox potential on the LMO surface. In carbonate electrolytes, the reversible characteristics of Fc can be measured by dividing the peak current ratio of oxidation and reduction. Since the oxidation/reduction ratio is close to unity, the reversible characteristic of Fc is maintained in the carbonate electrolyte. Furthermore, the observed redox potential of Fc is 3.26 V (
 <italic>vs</italic>. Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup>), which is far below the working voltage of LMO. Since spontaneous charge transfer occurs from the redox potential difference between the LMO electrode and the film-penetrating Fc molecules, Fc can be used as a redox indicator for surface film penetration. Moreover, Fc has a much larger molecular size than HF; therefore, the penetration characteristic of the HF molecule into the formed surface film can be successfully verified.
