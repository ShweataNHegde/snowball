 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows the experimental scheme of the penetrated Fc redox indicator electrochemical measurement. The LMO electrode was pre-cycled five times for the surface film formation. The Coulombic efficiency and OCV retention obtained after fully charging the LMO indicate that the film was effectively formed on the LMO surface, thereby suppressing the self-discharge of LMO. After stabilization of the LMO electrode, Fc was injected into the electrolyte solution at the fully charged LMO electrode comprising the cell. Since the redox indicator is readily oxidized on the LMO electrode surface and diffuses the current-collecting 3.0 V (

 <sup>+</sup>) polarized Pt mesh surface, the oxidized Fc is re-collected on the Pt mesh surface. Thus, the self-discharge of LMO electrode from the penetrated Fc molecule was directly observed from the redox current generation. The Fc-induced redox current was further verified by conducting OCV measurements of the LMO electrode. Because the self-discharge of LMO is due to the penetration of Fc into the deposited surface film, lithiation (self-discharge) of the LMO electrode occurs simultaneously. In short, the self-discharge from the Fc penetration is measured by the self-discharge of the LMO electrode and the redox current generated from the ferrocenium (Fc
 <sup>+</sup>) formation on the LMO surface.
