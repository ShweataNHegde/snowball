<p id="Par30">Before adding the redox indicator, a film was deposited on the pristine LMO surface. Pre-cycling is known as an effective passivating film-forming procedure on the active material surface; thus, pre-cycling was conducted before adding the redox indicator into a four-electrode cell [ref]. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the pre-cycling profile and Coulombic efficiency of the LMO electrode at room temperature. Because uniform film formation is crucial for the passivation of redox-active molecules, low 
 <italic>C</italic>-rate repeated cycling was conducted. The pre-cycling demonstrated stable time 
 <italic>vs</italic>. voltage curves from the LMO active material. Moreover, the open-circuit voltage (OCV) after the 6th de-lithiation is well retained after a rest period of 10 h. Hence, the film is well-formed on the LMO surface, and the self-discharge of LMO is suppressed from the as-formed surface film. Note that even lithiation and de-lithiation of active material are conducted with two-phase reactions, the severe self-discharge of active material greatly affects OCV values [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. While the Coulombic efficiency was approximately 95% in the initial cycle, a gradual increase in Coulombic efficiency was observed after repeated cycling and was maintained at over 99 %; hence, the electrolyte decomposition on the LMO surface is focused on the initial formation cycling. From the time
