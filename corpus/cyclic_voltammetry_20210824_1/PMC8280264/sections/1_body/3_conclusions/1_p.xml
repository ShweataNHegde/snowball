<p id="Par36">The Fc molecule is introduced as the redox indicator for the surface film passivation ability of the LiMn
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> (LMO) positive electrode. From the charge transfer of LMO to the penetratedÂ Fc molecule near the LMO surface, the self-discharge of the LMO electrode and the diffusion current from ferrocenium molecule is observed. The surface film on LMO derived from the carbonate electrolyte suppresses continuous electrolyte decomposition, while the infiltration of Fc molecules is not obstructed. Because the Fc molecule is larger than the LMO-attacking HF molecule, the degradation of LMO surface from the HF attack cannot be restrained in conventional carbonate-derived films. Therefore, to improve the LMO-comprised LIBs, a positive electrode surface passivating functional electrolyte is needed to prevent HF from approaching the LMO surface. Hence the surface film modification of LMO to suppress the penetration of HF is crucial for enhancing the electrochemical performance of LMO electrode.
