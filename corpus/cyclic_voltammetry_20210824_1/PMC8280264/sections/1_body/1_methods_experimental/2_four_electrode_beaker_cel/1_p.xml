<p id="Par27">To measure the leakage current on the LMO electrode surface after formation, two working electrode-added four electrode cell was designed. The cell was composed of Li metal/Pt mesh (Sigma Aldrich)/LMO electrode/Li metal. The PP-PE-PP separator was added in each contact of electrodes. For the initial film formation on LMO electrode, 15 mL of 1.0
