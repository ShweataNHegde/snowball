is a growing phenomenon in our society causing
many negative effects such as global warming. There is a need for
the development of new sustainable materials for energy storage. Carbons
are materials derivable from biowaste that can rather easily store
energy due to their high conductivity and surface area. However, their
large-scale processing is challenging as derived materials can be
rather heterogeneous and homogenization requires ball milling, a process
that can damage carbons in the process of oxidation. Herein, we have
prepared caffeine-derived noble nitrogen-doped carbon that withstands
the ball milling process without significant oxidation. Additionally,
it performs extraordinarily as a cathode material for lithium-ion
capacitors, making it an attractive biowaste-derived alternative to
commercial heavy metal cathodes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ball milling</kwd><kwd>Li-ion capacitors</kwd><kwd>caffeine</kwd><kwd>noble carbons</kwd><kwd>sustainability</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100004189</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NA</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>am1c06013</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>am1c06013</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Global warming is a man-made phenomenon caused by the excessive
production of greenhouse gases. The biggest share of greenhouse gases
is carbon dioxide generated during the combustion of fossil fuels.
There is an ongoing attempt to replace fossil fuels with carbon-neutral
sources, mostly producing electrical energy from sun, wind, and hydropower.
However, storage of electrical energy is not trivial and special devices
for reversible electrical energy storage (i.e., EES devices) are needed.</p><p>The two main types of EES devices are secondary batteries and capacitors.
Secondary batteries utilize two different redox reactions occurring
on the opposite electrodes for EES, while capacitors utilize high
surface area conductive networks for the electrostatic adsorption
of ions on the surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> While secondary batteries exhibit
high energy densities, capacitors show high power densities. Less
than two decades ago, ion capacitors, a new type of hybrid EES device
merging the advantages of batteries and capacitors, started to be
developed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> Ion capacitors utilize one battery-type electrode and one capacitor-type
electrode to deliver a device with energy densities higher than capacitors
and power densities higher than batteries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> Hybrid lithium capacitors are of special interest as existing lithium-ion
battery technologies, such as anodes, can be directly applied.</p><p>A common cathode material for lithium-ion capacitors is activated
carbon due to its low price, good conductivity, high surface area,
and synthesizability from biowaste.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> Furthermore,
nitrogen doping has been proven to improve the electroactivity of
hybrid ion capacitors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> making highly N-doped materials
an interesting choice for the synthesis of the new generation of lithium-ion
hybrid capacitors. However, activated carbons and related materials
are usually obtained as powders requiring the processing to prepare
the electrodes. The preparation of electrodes from powdery materials
is not a standardized process, and it varies from one research school
to another. Though electrode preparation directly affects many of
the properties of the final device tested, the process is often overlooked
in research papers. Among the different strategies, ball milling using
stainless steel jars is a well-established technique implemented in
industry at a very large scale due to the fact that stainless steel
is a relatively inexpensive as compared to other common ball milling
materials such as tungsten carbide and zirconia. In the context of
electrode preparation, ball milling is used to prepare homogeneous
electrode inks by mixing the active material, a conductive additive,
the binder, and the dispersing agent since it can easily be scaled
up.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> However, when ball milling the ink mixtures,
they are submitted to harsh oxidation conditions. As a result, the
active carbon materials undergo oxidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> and end up
contaminated mainly with iron coming from the stainless steel balls,
as described previously for inorganic compounds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> As a result, the ball milling equipment erodes and the performance
of the material becomes questionable as it often occurs that the effect
of the metallic impurities in the carbonaceous materials is treated
as part of the performance of the material.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> In this context, noble carbons are very promising candidates for
effective ball milling. Noble carbons are a new class of carbon-based
materials comprising a high resistance upon oxidation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> Noble carbons are obtained upon heat treatment
of a series of specific organic precursors that are already very resistant
upon oxidation themselves (i.e., ionic liquids, nucleobases, or certain
organic dyes).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> Contrary to what occurs when
carbonizing a conventional precursor (i.e., glucose), a noble carbon
precursor decomposition leads to the formation of new and even more
stable bonds to satisfy thermodynamics, which results in materials
with low HOMO levels and great stability upon oxidation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> Recently, a noble C<sub>1</sub>N<sub>1</sub>-like material exhibiting large stability upon oxidation derived
from guanine, a purine nucleobase, was reported. At high temperatures,
the synthesis yielded a CN covalent material comprising less nitrogen
(C/N ratio of 7) but still exhibiting high resistance upon oxidation
and an ultrahigh surface area, thus standing as an excellent candidate
for EES electrode ink preparation <italic>via</italic> ball milling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup></p><p>In this paper, a noble CN material derived from caffeine (CafCN),
a xanthine comprising a structure similar to purines, was compared
to activated carbon with similar porosity (KC) and its nitrogen-doped
analog (N-KC) in terms of electrochemical activity and resistance
upon ball milling. The results were critically compared giving a great
emphasis on the changes of these carbons as a result of electrode
preparation <italic>via</italic> ball milling.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Synthesis

but no trace of iron particles was observed. It was concluded that
iron leakage during ball milling is connected to the oxidation of
carbon. CafNC, as representative noble carbon, Kuraray carbon (KC),
and nitrogen-doped Kuraray carbon (N-KC) were ball-milled for 50 min
and compared. Elemental analysis before and after ball milling for
50 min was run in all three samples (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.1c06013/suppl_file/am1c06013_si_001.pdf">Table S1</ext-link> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>). Upon
grinding, both KC and N-KC undergo significant oxidation (lower relative
carbon content), which is not observed in the case of CafNC. This
points to the high oxidative resistance of CafNC as part of the noble
carbon family. Thermogravimetric analyses in synthetic air for CafNC,
KC, and N-KC (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.1c06013/suppl_file/am1c06013_si_001.pdf">Figure S3</ext-link>) give more information
on the type of stability of the samples toward oxidative environments.
Interestingly, CafNC shows lower stability of this material when compared
to KC and N-KC, which indicates that the oxidation path where the
sample undergoes upon ball milling is different from the one occurring
upon heat treatment. The differences between thermal oxidation and
oxidation upon ball milling made us track iron and chromium contamination
upon ball milling by ICP-OES (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref> and <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.1c06013/suppl_file/am1c06013_si_001.pdf">Table S2</ext-link>). All the
pristine carbons contained insignificant levels of iron contamination,
but upon ball milling, KC and N-KC absorb significantly more iron
than CafNC. Similar iron absorption by KC (nitrogen content around
1%) and N-KC (nitrogen content around 5%) highlights the independence
of metal adsorption from the nitrogen content. The much lower iron
uptake of CafCN and much larger resistance upon ball milling oxidation
indicate that the oxidation mechanism occurring involves the incorporation
of metals from the grinding balls. Interestingly, noble CN materials
resist that process much better than conventional carbons. To prove
that the resistance does not only correlate to the nitrogen content
of the sample, a sample identical to CafCN but treated at 800 &#x000b0;C
(herein called CafCN800) was prepared and its composition was analyzed
before and after 50 min of ball milling. The results summarized in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.1c06013/suppl_file/am1c06013_si_001.pdf">Table S3</ext-link> show that sample CafCN800 has a very

homogeneity of the sample was evaluated <italic>via</italic> energy-dispersive

better, more than twice as good upon 50 cycles. This can be ascribed
to the resistance of CafNC to oxidative damage upon sample preparation
and its larger nitrogen content. For instance, it is well known that
a high nitrogen content increases the performance of supercapacitors
due to electrostatic stabilization of adsorbed ions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> as all three pristine carbons have otherwise similar porosities,

carbon, a class of nitrogen-rich carbonaceous material characterized
by its resistance to oxidation, derived from caffeine was prepared
and characterized. Additionally, it was used as a model noble carbon
material to investigate its resistivity to oxidation during ball milling
and compared to non-noble carbon and nitrogen-doped non-noble carbon
with similar porosity. Non-noble carbon withstands not only a much
lower oxidation but also a much lower uptake of iron from the milling
equipment. Last, such carbon performs much better than its non-noble
counterpart does as a lithium-hybrid capacitor, achieving extraordinary
performance ascribed to its processability in the ball mill and high
nitrogen content.</p></sec></body><back><notes id="notes2" notes-type="si"><title>Supporting Information Available</title><p>The Supporting Information
