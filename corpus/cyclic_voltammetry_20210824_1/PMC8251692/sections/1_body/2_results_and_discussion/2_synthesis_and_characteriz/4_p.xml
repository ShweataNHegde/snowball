 <sub>2</sub> adsorption isotherms were used to further evaluate the porous morphology of the materials. KC and N-KC exhibit a combination of type I and type IV N
 <sub>2</sub> adsorption isotherms at 77 K indicative of the presence of both mesopores and micropores in the samples (

 </xref>a). On the other hand, CafNC shows a type I isotherm with a slight hysteresis at intermediate relative pressures, indicating that the sample is mainly microporous but also shows some mesoporosity. Specific surface areas were calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. As can be seen in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref>
 </xref>, the materials show very similar surface areas (i.e., 1496, 1672, and 1422 m
 <sup>2</sup> g
 <sup>–1</sup> for CafNC, KC, and N-KC, respectively) and total pore volumes. Pore size distribution (PSD) calculated using quenched solid density functional theory (QSDFT) to nitrogen adsorption isotherms shows that all the samples present well-defined mesopores of 2.2 nm in diameter (see
