 </sup> In the process, they absorb iron from the sample, but no trace of iron particles was observed. It was concluded that iron leakage during ball milling is connected to the oxidation of carbon. CafNC, as representative noble carbon, Kuraray carbon (KC), and nitrogen-doped Kuraray carbon (N-KC) were ball-milled for 50 min and compared. Elemental analysis before and after ball milling for 50 min was run in all three samples (

 </xref>). Upon grinding, both KC and N-KC undergo significant oxidation (lower relative carbon content), which is not observed in the case of CafNC. This points to the high oxidative resistance of CafNC as part of the noble carbon family. Thermogravimetric analyses in synthetic air for CafNC, KC, and N-KC (

Interestingly, CafNC shows lower stability of this material when compared to KC and N-KC, which indicates that the oxidation path where the sample undergoes upon ball milling is different from the one occurring upon heat treatment. The differences between thermal oxidation and oxidation upon ball milling made us track iron and chromium contamination upon ball milling by ICP-OES (

 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.1c06013/suppl_file/am1c06013_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Table S2</ext-link>). All the pristine carbons contained insignificant levels of iron contamination, but upon ball milling, KC and N-KC absorb significantly more iron than CafNC. Similar iron absorption by KC (nitrogen content around 1%) and N-KC (nitrogen content around 5%) highlights the independence of metal adsorption from the nitrogen content. The much lower iron uptake of CafCN and much larger resistance upon ball milling oxidation indicate that the oxidation mechanism occurring involves the incorporation of metals from the grinding balls. Interestingly, noble CN materials resist that process much better than conventional carbons. To prove that the resistance does not only correlate to the nitrogen content of the sample, a sample identical to CafCN but treated at 800 Â°C (herein called CafCN800) was prepared and its composition was analyzed before and after 50 min of ball milling. The results summarized in
