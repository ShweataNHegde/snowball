<p>Scanning electron microscopy images of CafNC at large magnification show a rough surface, indicating that the salt melt chosen acted as an effective template to induce a very narrow porous network in the sample (

The KC surface is rough as expected due to the characteristic of the commercial sample. Sample N-KC preserves its surface roughness, also indicating that the porous network of KC was not fully clogged by the synthetic strategy chosen to introduce heteroatoms. On the other hand, transmission electron microscopy images suggest the presence of a mesoporous network for samples KC and N-KC whereas a much flatter morphology of CafNC indicates mainly the presence of micropores in the sample.
