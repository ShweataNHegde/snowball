 </sup> In brief, 1 g of caffeine was mixed in a ratio of 1:20 wt/wt with the salt mix and treated at 700 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere. After cooling down, the rest of the salts were washed away using 1 M HCl. The prepared sample will be named hereafter as CafNC. SEM–EDX results (

While KC and N-KC show almost no absorption features, CafNC shows bands at 3200, 1576, 1192, and 663 cm

The broad nature of the peak indicates that samples are not well ordered. In the case of KC and N-KC, a second broad peak at 44° ascribed to in-plane carbon atoms is visible.
