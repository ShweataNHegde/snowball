<p>Last, the sample was cycled at 0.8 A g
 <sup>–1</sup> for 300 cycles (

  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>e). The capacity first reaches, due to slow wetting of more and more of the carbon’s surface, a capacity of around 45 mAh g
 <sup>–1</sup>, retaining the said capacity without significant loss after 200 more cycles. The extraordinary performance of the material can be ascribed to a high nitrogen content and ball-milling resistivity. As the material is biowaste-derived, it holds great potential for commercial applications.
