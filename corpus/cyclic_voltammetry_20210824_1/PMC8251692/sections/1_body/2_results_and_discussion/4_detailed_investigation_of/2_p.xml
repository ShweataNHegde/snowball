<p>Electrochemical performance of C/CafNC was studied in depth 
 <italic>via</italic> charging-discharging tests at varying current densities, for 300 cycles at a constant current density of 0.8 A g
 <sup>–1</sup>, and 
 <italic>via</italic> cyclic voltammetry at varying scan rates (

  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>). Samples tested 
 <italic>via</italic> charging-discharging tests at different current densities were first cycled for 20 cycles at 0.05 A g
 <sup>–1</sup> until no significant change in the capacity was observed. Subsequently, the current density was increased to 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 A g
 <sup>–1</sup> for 10 cycles each, only to be reduced to the beginning value for the last 10 cycles (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>a). At a current density of 0.05 A g
 <sup>–1</sup>, the maximum observed discharge capacities are around 55 mA g
 <sup>–1</sup>, and as expected, they are reduced upon the increase in current densities. However, no significant reduction has been observed as discharge capacities of around 30 mAh g
 <sup>–1</sup> are visible at a high current density of 0.8 A g
 <sup>–1</sup>. Upon the decrease in current density to the original value of 0.05 A g
 <sup>–1</sup>, the capacities increase reaching similar values as in the first 20 cycles, pointing that no damage was done to the samples at higher current densities. Charging-discharging profiles are distorted triangles as expected for hybrid lithium capacitors (

 </sup> Additionally, they show that both charging and discharging are quick so that a full cycle occurs in less than 5 min at 0.8 A g
 <sup>–1</sup>.
