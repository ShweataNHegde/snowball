<p>A better understanding of the differences between the pre-ground and directly prepared carbon ink was achieved by analyzing the samples using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (

 </xref>b,c). SEM micrographs show how C/CafNC exhibits much smaller particles than r-C/CafNC, resulting in better contact between the particles of CafNC and the conductive additive. Additionally, the homogeneity of the sample was evaluated
