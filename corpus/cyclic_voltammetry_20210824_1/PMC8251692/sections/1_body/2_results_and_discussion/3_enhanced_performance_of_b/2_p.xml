<p>The electrochemical performance of CafNC was tested after its incorporation in electrodes. CafNC powder was mixed with a conductive additive and ground for 50 min. Afterward, 1 mL of NMP with a dispersed binder was added and the mixture was further milled for 10 min to assure good dispersion of the ink (details of the procedure are given in the

Upon drying, a sample denoted as C/CafNC was obtained. The importance of ball milling before ink preparation was assessed by the electrochemical test of the ink prepared without prior ball milling (ng-C/CafNC). Performances of C/CafNC and ng-C/CafNC were evaluated

Alike non-noble carbons, ball-milled CafNC shows superior electrochemical performance to the non-ball-milled ones.
