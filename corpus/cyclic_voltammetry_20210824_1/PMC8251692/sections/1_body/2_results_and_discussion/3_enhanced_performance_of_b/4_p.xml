<p>The performance of the three carbons as electrodes in lithium-ion supercapacitors was analyzed (

While KC and N-KC perform similarly, CafNC performs significantly better, more than twice as good upon 50 cycles. This can be ascribed to the resistance of CafNC to oxidative damage upon sample preparation and its larger nitrogen content. For instance, it is well known that a high nitrogen content increases the performance of supercapacitors due to electrostatic stabilization of adsorbed ions
