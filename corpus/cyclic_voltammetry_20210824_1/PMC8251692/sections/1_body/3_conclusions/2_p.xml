<p>Noble carbon, a class of nitrogen-rich carbonaceous material characterized by its resistance to oxidation, derived from caffeine was prepared and characterized. Additionally, it was used as a model noble carbon material to investigate its resistivity to oxidation during ball milling and compared to non-noble carbon and nitrogen-doped non-noble carbon with similar porosity. Non-noble carbon withstands not only a much lower oxidation but also a much lower uptake of iron from the milling equipment. Last, such carbon performs much better than its non-noble counterpart does as a lithium-hybrid capacitor, achieving extraordinary performance ascribed to its processability in the ball mill and high nitrogen content.</p>
