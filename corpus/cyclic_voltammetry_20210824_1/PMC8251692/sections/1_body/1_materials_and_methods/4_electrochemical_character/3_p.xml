<p>All electrochemical measurements were performed in Swagelok-type cells. Lithium foil, Celgard 2325 (13 mm in diameter, 25 μm thick), and 1 M LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> in ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate (volumetric ratio of 1:1, 100 μL, a solution used as obtained from Sigma-Aldrich) were used as the counter electrode, membrane, and electrolyte, respectively. A circular carbon current collector covered with the active material was used as a working electrode. All Swagelok-type cells were assembled in a glovebox with low water and oxygen levels. Charging-discharging measurements were performed at constant current densities (0.2 A g
 <sup>–1</sup> for 100 cycles and 0.8 A g
 <sup>–1</sup> for 1000 cycles) or at varying current densities (20 cycles at 0.05 A g
 <sup>–1</sup>, 10 cycles at 0.10 A g
 <sup>–1</sup>, 10 cycles at 0.20 A g
 <sup>–1</sup>, 10 cycles at 0.40 A g
 <sup>–1</sup>, 10 cycles at 0.80 A g
 <sup>–1</sup>, and 10 cycles at 0.05 A g
 <sup>–1</sup>) in triplicate. Cyclic voltammetry was performed by cycling at 5 mV s
 <sup>–1</sup> during 30 cycles and at 2, 1, 0.5, 0.2, and 0.1 mV s
 <sup>–1</sup> for subsequently one cycle each. In the displayed cycling voltammetry curves, the last cycle at the respective speed is always shown unless mentioned otherwise.
