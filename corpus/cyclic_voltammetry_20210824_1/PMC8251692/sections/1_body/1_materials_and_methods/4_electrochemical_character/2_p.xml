<p>Electrodes were prepared by taking 42 mg of the respective carbon material and ball milling it along with 12 mg of Super P carbon in stainless steel jars (12.5 mL equipped with five stainless steel balls with a diameter of 1 cm) for 50 min at 650 rpm in a planetary ball mill (Retsch PM 100). After the initial grinding, 1 mL of PVDF solution was added (concentration, 6 mg mL
 <sup>–1</sup>) and the prepared sample was further ground for 10 more minutes. The prepared ink (40 μL) was dropped on 11 mm carbon paper discs (Spectracarb 2050A-0550) that were dried for 1 h at 80 °C in the air to remove possible volatile impurities. The formed electrodes were dried at 120 °C for 17 h under vacuum. Sample ng-C/CafNC was prepared without initial grinding. Loading of all the electrodes was 2.0–2.5 mg cm
 <sup>–2</sup>. Furthermore, the exact mass of all the electrodes can be found in
