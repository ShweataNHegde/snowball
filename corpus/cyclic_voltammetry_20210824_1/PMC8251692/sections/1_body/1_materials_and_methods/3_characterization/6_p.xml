<p>Nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms at 77 K were analyzed by a Quantachrome Quadrasorb SI apparatus. A 3P Instruments Masterprep degassing machine was used to degas the samples at 150 °C under vacuum (0.5 Torr) for 20 h before the measurements. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method was used to calculate the specific surface area from adsorption branch data (
