<p>A PerkinElmer ICP-OES Optima 8000 was used to perform inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). In a standard procedure, 10 mg of samples was dissolved in 500 μL of a 1:3 HNO
 <sub>3</sub>:HCl mixture before the analysis. The heterogeneous mixture was kept at room temperature for 12 h and at 96 °C for 1 h. After spontaneous cooling down, the samples were diluted in ultrapure water to 10 mL and filtrated after the measurement. Four calibration standard solutions per element were used to obtain the curve.
