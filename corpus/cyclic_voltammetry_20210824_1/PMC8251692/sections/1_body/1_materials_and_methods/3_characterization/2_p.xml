<p>Powder X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded with a Bruker D8 Advance instrument with Cu-Kα as a radiation source (λ = 0.154 nm). A NaI scintillation counter detector was used to observe X-ray diffractions. The patterns were analyzed in a range between 5 and 70° for 2θ with steps of 0.05° and 2 s.</p>
