<p>Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was recorded on a LEO 15550-Gemini instrument. Before the analysis, the samples were sputtered with a ca. 10 nm layer of an 80% gold and 20% platinum mixture. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy was run using a couple of EDX analyzers (Oxford Instruments). An EM 102 Zeiss instrument operating at 120 kV was used to record transmission electron microscopy micrographs (TEM). The samples were prepared on a copper grid by drop-casting sample dispersions in ethanol.</p>
