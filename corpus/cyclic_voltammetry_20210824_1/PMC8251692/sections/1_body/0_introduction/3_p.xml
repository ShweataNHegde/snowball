<p>The two main types of EES devices are secondary batteries and capacitors. Secondary batteries utilize two different redox reactions occurring on the opposite electrodes for EES, while capacitors utilize high surface area conductive networks for the electrostatic adsorption of ions on the surface.

 </sup> While secondary batteries exhibit high energy densities, capacitors show high power densities. Less than two decades ago, ion capacitors, a new type of hybrid EES device merging the advantages of batteries and capacitors, started to be developed.

 </sup> Ion capacitors utilize one battery-type electrode and one capacitor-type electrode to deliver a device with energy densities higher than capacitors and power densities higher than batteries.
