<p>Global warming is a man-made phenomenon caused by the excessive production of greenhouse gases. The biggest share of greenhouse gases is carbon dioxide generated during the combustion of fossil fuels. There is an ongoing attempt to replace fossil fuels with carbon-neutral sources, mostly producing electrical energy from sun, wind, and hydropower. However, storage of electrical energy is not trivial and special devices for reversible electrical energy storage (i.e., EES devices) are needed.</p>
