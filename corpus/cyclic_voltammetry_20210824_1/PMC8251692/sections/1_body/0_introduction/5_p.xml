<p>In this paper, a noble CN material derived from caffeine (CafCN), a xanthine comprising a structure similar to purines, was compared to activated carbon with similar porosity (KC) and its nitrogen-doped analog (N-KC) in terms of electrochemical activity and resistance upon ball milling. The results were critically compared giving a great emphasis on the changes of these carbons as a result of electrode preparation
