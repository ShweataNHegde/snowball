<p>During each charging and discharging process, only one current peak is clearly observed, which indicates on the cathode side the presence of an oxidation and reduction reaction, respectively. In the charging process, the peak maximum shifts from 3.80 V to 3.86 V with decreasing slurry pH value from 12.0 to 10.8. However, when the slurry pH value decreases further below 10.8, the corresponding peak voltage remains at 3.87 V. In discharging process, the maximum peak shifts from 3.70 V to 3.66 V voltage with decreasing slurry pH value to 10.8, while the voltage of the peak maximum remains unchanged at 3.64 V for cells with electrodes produced with slurry pH values from 9.2 to 7.4.</p>
