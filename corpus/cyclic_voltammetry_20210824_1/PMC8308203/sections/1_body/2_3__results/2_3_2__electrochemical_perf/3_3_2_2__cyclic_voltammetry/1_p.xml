<p>CV measurements of cells with unstructured cathodes were performed in order to investigate the impact of the added amount of acetic acid on the electrochemical reaction of the active material. The current peaks in CV correspond to redox reactions and can be assigned to different phase transitions. The recorded signals were fitted using the Gaussian window function in MATLAB (MathWorks Inc., Version: R2019b, Natick, MA, USA). The recorded current signals in

For each sample, the measured three cycles for each cell overlap with each other, which proves quite good cycle stability of the prepared electrodes.
