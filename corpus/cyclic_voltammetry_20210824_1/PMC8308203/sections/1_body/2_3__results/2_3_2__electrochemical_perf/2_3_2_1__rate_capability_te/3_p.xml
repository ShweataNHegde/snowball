<p>The specific capacities of cells with thin-film electrodes are higher than cells containing thick-film electrodes produced with the same slurry pH value (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01840-f006">Figure 6</xref>b), especially at high discharge rates (≥C/2). After the C/20 formation step, all cells achieve similar specific capacities of 153–157 mAh/g, which are similar to those obtained with thick-film electrodes. With increasing C-rate, the specific capacity of all cells shows successive deterioration. For C/10 up to 1C, cells with thin-film electrodes show similar discharge capacities: 149–152 mAh/g at C/10, 143 mAh/g at C/5, 133 mAh/g at C/2, and 120 to 125 mAh/g at 1C. In this C-rate range, electrodes produced with different slurry pH values show no significant difference. However, from 2C to 5C, the capacity of thin-film electrodes decreases with increasing cycle number, especially for electrodes that were produced with a slurry pH value of 7.4. The drop in capacity at high C-rates with decreasing slurry pH values is also observed in cells with thick-film electrodes. For the final C/5 cycles, the electrodes produced with slurry pH values of 12.0 and 7.4 show the highest reversible specific capacity of 137 mAh/g, which had 95% capacity retention compared to the initial C/5 cycles (144 mAh/g), while other cells containing cathodes produced with slurry pH values of 10.7 and 9.2 show lower reversible specific capacity of 130 mAh/g with capacity retention of 90%.
