<p>In order to verify the capacity retention of electrodes after being cycled at high discharge rates up to 3C, the C-rate was reduced to C/5. All cells show less specific capacity compared to the previous C/5 cycles. The cell with the electrode produced with a slurry pH value of 12.1 provides the highest specific capacity of 124 mAh/g with a capacity retention of 95%, while the lowest capacity belongs to the electrode produced with a slurry pH value of 8.4 with a specific capacity of 69 mAh/g and 77% capacity retention.</p>
