 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01840-f007">Figure 7</xref> shows the discharge capacities of cells containing structured thick-film electrodes which were produced with slurry pH values of 12.1, 10.0, and 9.0. During the formation step and C/10 cycles, all cells with structured electrodes show discharge capacities reduced by 4 mAh/g in comparison to cells with unstructured electrodes produced with the same slurry pH values and same film thicknesses. In following cycling steps at C/5, a capacity increase of 14 mAh/g and 18 mAh/g is observed for cells containing structured cathodes produced with slurry pH values of 9.0 and 10.0 in comparison to cells with unstructured electrodes, respectively, while cells with laser structured electrodes without acid addition have 7 mAh/g lower capacity than cells with unstructured electrodes. However, when the C-rate is increased above C/2, laser structured electrodes begin to show a great improvement regarding specific discharge capacity retention regardless of the slurry pH values used during electrode preparation. The cell with structured electrode produced with a slurry pH value of 12.1 retains the highest discharge capacity from C/2 to 3C, while the cell containing structured cathode produced with a slurry pH value of 10.0 shows 46% higher capacity at C/2 compared to the cell with an unstructured cathode. After being cycled at elevated C-rates, the cell with the structured cathode (slurry pH value of 12.1) shows a capacity retention of 97% compared to the previous first cycle at C/5, while cells produced with slurry pH values of 10.0 and 9.0 maintain 96% discharge capacity.
