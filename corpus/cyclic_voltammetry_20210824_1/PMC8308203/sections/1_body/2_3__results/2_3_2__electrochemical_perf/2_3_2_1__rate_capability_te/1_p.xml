<p>The specific discharge capacity of water-based NMC 622 electrodes is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01840-f006">Figure 6</xref>. In the formation step at C/20, the specific capacities of all cells with thick-film electrodes are slightly increased. For example, for cells containing electrodes produced with slurry pH values of 10.0, 9.0, and 8.6, the specific capacity increased from 153 mAh/g to 158 mAh/g after formation, while cells containing cathodes produced with slurry pH values of 12.1 and 10.8 achieve about 150 mAh/g capacity at the third C/20 cycle. At C/10, the cell with the electrode produced with a slurry pH value of 9.0 retains the highest specific capacity of 150 mAh/g, while the cell with the electrode produced with a slurry pH value of 8.4 shows the lowest specific capacity of 136 mAh/g. As the C-rate rises to C/5 and C/2, cells containing electrodes produced with a slurry pH value of 12.1 hold the highest capacity of 130 mAh/g and 91 mAh/g at C/5 and C/2, respectively, while the lowest specific capacities (90 mAh/g at C/5 and 37 mAh/g at C/2) belong to the electrode produced with a slurry pH value of 8.4. At 1C and 2C, all cells with thick-film electrodes show a drop in capacity by more than 80% with regard to the initial capacity, except those cells containing electrodes that were produced without acid addition (slurry pH value 12.1). The cell with the electrode produced without acid addition maintains the highest capacity of 35 mAh/h at 1C and 9 mAh/g at 2C. For discharge rates of 3C and 5C, all cells with thick-film electrodes no longer show any capacity.
