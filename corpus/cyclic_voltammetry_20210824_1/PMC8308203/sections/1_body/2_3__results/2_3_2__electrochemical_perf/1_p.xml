<p>Thick-film and thin-film NMC 622 electrodes with different slurry pH values were assembled vs. lithium in coin cells. Laser structured thick-film electrodes with pH 12.1, 10, and 9 were assembled in order to study the effect of laser structuring on cell performance. The results from the rate capability test as well as cyclic voltammetry are presented and discussed.</p>
