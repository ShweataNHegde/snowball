<p>For the purpose of improving lithium-ion diffusion kinetics, thick-film electrodes with slurry pH values of 12.1, 10.0, and 9.0 were structured via ultrafast laser ablation prior to cell assembling and subsequent galvanostatic measurements. The data of laser structured electrodes are summarized in 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-11-01840-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The mass loss due to laser ablation includes the removal of active material, binder, and conductive additive.
