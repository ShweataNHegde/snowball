<p>In order to adjust the pH value, acetic acid was added to the slurry. Since the pH value of slurries with an aqueous binder increased with time [
 <xref rid="B21-nanomaterials-11-01840" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], the slurry pH values were measured 10 min after slurry completion. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01840-f001">Figure 1</xref>, the pH value of the slurry linearly decreases with the amount of added acetic acid. The mass ratio of acetic acid given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01840-f001">Figure 1</xref> is referred to as the mass ratio of acetic acid and NMC 622.
