<p>Slurries with different pH values were tape cast on 20 µm Al-foil and dried in ambient air. The details of the electrodes are summarized in 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-11-01840-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Thick-film electrodes with mass loading from 37 to 46 mg/cm
 <sup>2</sup> were manufactured, while thin-film electrodes with about 11 mg/cm
 <sup>2</sup> (1/4 in comparison to thick-film electrodes) were used to represent electrodes with a state-of-the-art film thickness. It was found that without acid addition, the cathodes have a high porosity of about 60%. For example, the cathode with a slurry pH value of 12.1 shows a 50 µm thicker layer in comparison to the cathode with a slurry pH value of 10.8, while the mass loading is reduced by 6 mg/cm
 <sup>2</sup>.
