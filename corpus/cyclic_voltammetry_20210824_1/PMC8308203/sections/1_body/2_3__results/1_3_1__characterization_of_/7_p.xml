<p>The SEM images of laser structured electrodes (slurry pH values of 12.1, 10.0, and 9.0) are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01840-f005">Figure 5</xref>. On the surface of electrodes manufactured with a slurry pH value of 12.1, holes with diameters varying from 10 µm to 100 µm were observed. Furthermore, cracks originated from the holes that were formed. As the slurry pH value decreased to 10.0, no crack formation and holes with diameters larger than 50 µm were obtained. At a slurry pH value of 9.0, no holes or craters were found in the entire electrode. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01840-f005">Figure 5</xref>d shows the line structure with 200 µm pitch which was generated using ultrafast laser ablation without damaging the aluminum current collector. A width of 30 ± 2 µm is achieved at the top of the groove, and the half-peak-width is 10 ± 1 µm. The sidewalls of the generated grooves show a slight curvature of 7.0° ± 0.3° and the orientation is perpendicular to the cathode surface. The laser fluence calculated from pulse energy and laser focus diameter is 14.7 J/cm
 <sup>2</sup>, while the pulse overlap is 96.7%. The active mass loss owing to the laser structuring process amounts 3% to 10%. No obvious debris formation is found on the electrode surface and inside the channel structures.
