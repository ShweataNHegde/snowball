<p>In addition to the slurry pH values, the film thickness is another decisive factor that influences electrode homogeneity. Inhomogeneous distribution of cathode materials is observed in thick-film electrodes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01840-f004">Figure 4</xref>). The dark regions marked with red circles are craters that were created by the inward collapse of electrode materials during the drying process. For thick-film cathodes (slurry pH value 12), craters with diameters ranging from 150 µm to 700 µm have been formed. By decreasing the slurry pH value to 10.8, the craters on the surface became smaller and shallower with diameters of 190 to 200 µm. As for thin-film electrodes with a slurry pH value of 12.0 and a thickness of 67 µm, the crater diameters were around 80 to 150 µm which is about a quarter in size compared to those in thick-film electrodes. In thin-film electrodes with slurry pH values of 10.7, the active material particles were uniformly distributed. No obvious cavities were found on the film surface. This proves that the corrosion of the current collector in thick-film electrodes has more impact in comparison to thin-film electrodes which is due to the longer drying time of thick-film electrodes.
