<p>Cross-sectional analyses were performed with electrodes whose slurries had different pH values, see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01840-f003">Figure 3</xref>. In the electrode film with a slurry pH value of 12.1, many cavities with diameters ranging from 60 to 284 µm were formed owing to the generation of H
 <sub>2</sub>, which is produced when aluminum is directly exposed to the alkaline slurry [
 <xref rid="B19-nanomaterials-11-01840" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The cavity structures are distributed across the electrode film, leaving openings with diameters from 25 to 105 µm on the electrode surface. When the slurry pH value decreases to 10.8, the diameters of cavities are reduced to 104 to 198 µm, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01840-f003">Figure 3</xref>c. Meanwhile, the amount of cavities is decreased. For example, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01840-f003">Figure 3</xref>d shows a segment of the cathode with a slurry pH value of 10.8 without obvious cavities. With further decreasing of slurry pH values to 10.0 and 9.1, the electrodes become flat without any cavities, as shown in
