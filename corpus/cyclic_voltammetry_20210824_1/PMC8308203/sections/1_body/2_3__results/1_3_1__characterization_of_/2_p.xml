<p>Before tape casting, the viscosity of slurries with different pH values was measured at shear rates from 0 to 100 s
 <sup>−1</sup>. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01840-f002">Figure 2</xref>a, slurries with different pH values show similar shear thinning behavior which means that the viscosity decreases with increasing shear rate. This indicates the existence of soft agglomerates within the slurries. With decreasing slurry pH value, a distinct increase of viscosity was found, suggesting that higher shear force is needed to break the agglomerates in slurries with lower pH values. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01840-f002">Figure 2</xref>b shows the viscosity of slurries with different pH values at a reference shear rate of 50 s
 <sup>−1</sup>. The functional relationship between viscosity and pH value shows approximately linear correlation. During experiments, it was found that slurries with a viscosity of 3 to 8 Pa·s at 50 s
 <sup>−1</sup> were beneficial to prepare thick-film electrodes. In general, the manufacturing of thick-film electrodes can be achieved by reducing the solvent (water) content or by increasing the binder content in slurries, which in both cases leads to an increase in viscosity.
