<p>Laser structuring via ultrafast laser ablation is an appealing method to improve capacity retention at high C-rates, especially for thick-film electrodes. During the formation step at C/20 as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01840-f007">Figure 7</xref>, the specific discharge capacity of cells containing unstructured electrodes is slightly higher compared to cells with structured electrodes. Such phenomena are also observed in the study from Park et al. using structured NMC 532 electrodes with PVDF as binder material [
 <xref rid="B29-nanomaterials-11-01840" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This might be explained by the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) between electrode and electrolyte [
 <xref rid="B52-nanomaterials-11-01840" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. With a higher slurry pH value, there are more cavities inside the electrode. During cycling, the electrolyte could be pressed into the cavities inside the electrode. The increased interface between the electrode and free electrolyte owing to laser structuring leads to the formation of an extended SEI area. This would consume a higher amount of active material and electrolyte. Another assumption is that the SEI formation might be completed in a short period since the electrolyte wetting of laser structured electrodes is faster, while the SEI in unstructured electrodes could form during the cycling over a longer time period. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) might be applied in order to verify these assumptions.
