<p>The effect of slurry pH value on electrode processing as well as on the electrochemical performance of cells with dried electrodes is discussed in detail. Cells with laser structured electrodes show higher specific capacity in comparison to cells with unstructured electrodes. This confirms the conducive effect of the 3D battery concept with the combination of a thick-film electrode and laser structuring.</p>
