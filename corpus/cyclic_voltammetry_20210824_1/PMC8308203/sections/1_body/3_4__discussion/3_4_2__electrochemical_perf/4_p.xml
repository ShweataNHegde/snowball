<p>The lowering of the discharge curve at a high C-rate is due to cell polarization induced by ohmic resistance, charge transfer resistance, and diffusion overpotential [
 <xref rid="B50-nanomaterials-11-01840" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The electrodes with larger film thicknesses have longer diffusion and migration pathways for lithium-ions to enter and leave the bulk electrode material. The particles in the upper region of the electrode, which are kinetically favored, are intercalating more lithium-ions than the underlying regions. This overpotential in the electrode contributes to additional mass transport losses. The effect is more pronounced for thick-film electrodes, which require higher electrical current density to overcome the mass transport potential. Therefore, the internal resistance of lithium-ion diffusion increases with increasing C-rate. The electronic resistance of the electrode is proportional to its thickness [

This can be directly observed by the IR-drop at the initial voltage change in each cycle. For example, the voltages for thick-film electrodes decrease from 4.2 V to 3.2â€“3.6 V at 1C, while the voltages for thin-film electrodes remain at about 4.0 V.
