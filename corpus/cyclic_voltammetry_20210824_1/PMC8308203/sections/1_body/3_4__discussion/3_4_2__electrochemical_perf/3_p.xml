 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01840-f011">Figure 11</xref> depicts voltage profiles of cells at selected C-rates of C/5, 1C, 3C, and finally C/5 to discuss in detail the influence of slurry pH values and film thicknesses on the electrochemical performance of the electrodes. At initial C/5, the discharge capacities of thin-film electrodes show no substantial difference, while thick-film electrodes show a 40 mAh/g difference between electrodes with different slurry pH values. With decreasing pH values, the lithium insertion along the voltage plateau is shortened. From 1C to 3C, the discharge capacities of thick-film electrodes drop sharply from less than 50 mAh/g to 0 mAh/g, while the discharge capacities of thin-film electrodes are reduced by 20 mAh/g for each step. The term “IR-drop” refers to the voltage drop resulted from the product of current (I) passing through resistance (R). A sudden voltage drop can be observed at the beginning of the discharge curves in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01840-f011">Figure 11</xref>. At 1C the IR-drop of cell with thin-film electrode produced with slurry pH value 7.4 is higher (from 4.20 V to 3.87 V) in comparison to cells containing electrodes with slurry pH values 12.0 and 10.7 (from 4.20 V to 3.99 V), which indicates a higher ohmic resistance for the cell containing electrodes produced with lower slurry pH values. After the C-rate is reduced to C/5, thin-film electrodes show 91 ± 4% capacity retention, while thick-film electrodes have a disperse capacity retention of 75%, 92%, and 95% for slurry pH values of 8, 11, and 12, respectively.
