 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01840-f009">Figure 9</xref>. With decreasing slurry pH values, the oxidation and reduction peaks shift to higher and lower potential, leading to an increase in voltage difference ΔE
 <sub>p</sub> of the redox couple. The rise of ΔE
 <sub>p</sub> indicates an increased cell polarization and therefore a sluggish electrochemical reaction [
 <xref rid="B49-nanomaterials-11-01840" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. This occurs as a result of the less porous structure in the electrode film. Due to the increased size and number of cavities inside the electrode film with high slurry pH values, the contact surface between electrode and electrolyte is enlarged and the lithium-ions diffusion from the liquid electrolyte to the electrode is enhanced in comparison to electrodes with lower porosity.
