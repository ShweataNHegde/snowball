<p>Cyclic voltammetry proves that the addition of acetic acid did not affect the electrochemical reaction of the cathode active material. The voltage difference was increased with decreasing slurry pH values. This occurs as a result of an increased cell polarization caused by a decreased electrode film porosity. A strong impact of the slurry pH value and cathode film thickness on the discharge capacity was observed in rate capability tests. At high C-rates above C/5 for thin-film electrodes and above C/10 for thick-film electrodes, the specific capacity of the electrode with a larger slurry pH value was increased. Thick-film electrodes without acid addition showed the highest capacity, while the electrodes with the highest amount of acid (pH 8.4) retain less capacity at C/10 to 1C. The same tendency is observed for cells with thin-film electrodes. This is due to an improved electrolyte lithium-ion diffusion kinetics inside the electrode with high porosity. Laser structuring is feasible to increase the rate capability of aqueous processed thick-film electrodes, especially at discharge rates above C/2, which is due to an enlarged surface between the active material and free electrolyte, and new diffusion pathways for lithium-ions. In addition, unlike cathodes with high porosity, laser structuring has no significant impact on the post-processing as well as the adhesion of the electrode film to the current collector. Therefore, the pH value of NMC 622 slurry should be adjusted to 9â€“10, taking into account the balance between rate capability and corrosion of the current collector, as well as the precondition for laser structuring.</p>
