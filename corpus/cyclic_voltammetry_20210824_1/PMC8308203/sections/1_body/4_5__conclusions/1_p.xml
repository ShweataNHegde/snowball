<p>Water-based binders CMC and TRD 202A were applied for the preparation of NMC 622 slurry, while acetic acid was added to balance the slurry pH value. Electrodes with different slurry pH values and thicknesses were tape cast on the aluminum foil and calendered afterward. In the last step, laser structuring using an ultrafast laser was performed to improve the electrochemical performance of cells at high C-rates.</p>
