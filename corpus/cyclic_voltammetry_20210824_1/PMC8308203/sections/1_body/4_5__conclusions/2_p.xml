<p>The chemical reaction between the slurry without pH modification (pH 12.1) and the aluminum current collector, accompanied by hydrogen release during tape casting, leads to a large number of cavities in the dried cathode film. When the slurry pH is decreased below 10, no cavities inside the thick-film electrode or craters on the electrode surface were observed. With an increasing amount of acid, the viscosity of cathode slurries raised from 2 to 9 Pa·s at a shear rate of 50 s
 <sup>−1</sup>, which is beneficial for thick-film manufacturing. However, the corrosion and hydrogen generation are stronger with increasing electrode thickness due to the fact that the drying time is necessarily increased with increasing film thickness.
