<p>Another way to lower the production costs of LIBs is to increase the electrode film thickness. The state-of-the-art cathodes are limited to 100 µm thickness with a mass loading of about 20 mg/cm
 <sup>2</sup> after being deposited onto the current collector [

A higher film electrode thickness, i.e., a higher areal capacity, is preferred since this not only increases the electrode specific capacity but also reduces the proportion of inactive materials in batteries. The costs of other manufacturing steps during assembling such as cutting, welding, and stacking, will be reduced [

 <xref rid="B26-nanomaterials-11-01840" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In order to solve this problem, structuring of thick-film electrodes (“3-dimensional battery”) using ultrafast laser ablation opens a new path to simultaneously increase energy density and power density [
