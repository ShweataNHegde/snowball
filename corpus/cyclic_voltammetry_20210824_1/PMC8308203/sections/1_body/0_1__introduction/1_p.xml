<p>Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been widely applied in energy storage applications, especially in personal portable electronic devices, due to their high energy density, long cyclic stability, and good safety [

 <xref rid="B6-nanomaterials-11-01840" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], there are still several technical challenges for the application of LIBs in automotive industries in order to meet or exceed the requirements compared to conventional vehicles with internal combustion engines, such as long cycle life (&gt;500 cycles), a calendar life &gt;10 years, and stability at different temperatures ranging from −30 to 52 °C [
