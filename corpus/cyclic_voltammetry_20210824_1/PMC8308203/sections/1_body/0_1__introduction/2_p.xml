<p>There are two possible approaches for a further significant reduction of the battery costs. The first method is to lower the electrode processing costs, which are associated with the expensive organic solvent and the drying process of the wet electrode. Polyvinylidenfluoride (PVDF) is a state-of-the-art binder in commercial LIBs, especially for cathodes. It must be dissolved by a volatile solvent named 
 <italic>N</italic>-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), which is not only expensive but also highly toxic. Therefore, extra ventilation and filtration devices are necessary for the protection of production lines and workersâ€™ safety [

During aqueous processing, water serves as a solvent for the preparation of electrode slurry, which lowers the material costs and is also favorable for the environment. The removal of water during drying is 4.5 times faster than for NMP and requires nearly 10 times less overall energy for the processing [
