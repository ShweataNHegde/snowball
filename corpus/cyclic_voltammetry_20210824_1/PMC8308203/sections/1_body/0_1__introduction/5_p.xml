<p>Many researchers have studied the effect of different types of acid addition on the cathode materials [

 <xref rid="B34-nanomaterials-11-01840" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, only a few groups have studied the effect of pH value on the electrochemical properties of electrodes. Ibing et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-nanomaterials-11-01840" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] studied the effect of pH values at 12.5 and 7.6 on the electrochemical performance of NMC 532 electrodes, while Bauer et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-nanomaterials-11-01840" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] reported the performance of aqueous processed NMC 111 electrodes at pH values of 7â€“11. So far to the best of our knowledge, no related research was established for NMC 622. Therefore, in the present work, NMC 622 cathodes were manufactured using aqueous binders CMC and TRD 202A. Different amounts of acetic acid were applied during the mixing process in order to investigate the effect of slurry pH value on the electrochemical performance of electrodes assembled in half cells. In addition, ultrafast laser structuring of thick-film electrodes was applied to prove the feasibility of the 3D battery concept for aqueous processed electrodes.
