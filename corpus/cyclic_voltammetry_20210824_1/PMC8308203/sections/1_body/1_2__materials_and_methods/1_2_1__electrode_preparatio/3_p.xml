<p>Afterward, ultrafast femtosecond (fs) fiber laser (Tangerine, Amplitude Systèmes, Pessac, France) with a pulse duration of 380 fs and an operational wavelength of 515 nm (M
 <sup>2</sup> &lt; 1.2) was applied to structure selected thick-film electrodes. Line structures with 200 µm pitch and with depths down to the current collector were generated. A repetition rate of 500 kHz and an average laser power of 4.27 W were applied, while the laser scanning speed was kept constant at 500 mm/s and the number of scan passes was varied from 30 to 50 with regard to the applied cathode film thickness. Cross-sectional analyses of electrodes using different scan passes were performed in order to find appropriate structuring parameters. Samples with a size of 2 cm × 1.3 cm (width × height) were cut using an ultrafast laser from the calendered cathode sheets. Then the samples were held vertically with a plastic clip and were placed in a holder and were afterward filled with resin, hardener, as well as fluorescent powder, to acquire metallographic samples. Afterward, the samples were ground and polished. The electrodes were cut in circles with 12 mm in diameter for coin cell design using 200 mm/s scanning speed and 10 scan passes, while the other parameters remained unchanged with regard to laser structuring. The laser processing was performed in ambient air.
