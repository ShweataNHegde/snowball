<p>The slurry obtained from previous steps was tape cast with a doctor blade (ZUA 2000.100, Proceq, Schwerzenbach, Switzerland) onto a 20 µm aluminum-foil using a tape casting coater (MSK-AFA-L800-LD, MTI Corporation, Richmond, CA, USA) with vacuum pump. The coating speed was set at 5 mm/s and the thickness of the coated cathode film was controlled by varying the gap of the doctor blade. The cast electrodes were dried at room temperature to avoid possible accelerated chemical corrosion which might occur at elevated temperatures. The thicknesses of dried cathodes were kept at 186–240 µm (mass loading: 34–47 mg/cm
 <sup>2</sup>) for thick-film and 50–130 µm (mass loading: 10–14 mg/cm
 <sup>2</sup>) for thin-film electrodes, respectively. Afterward, the electrodes were calendered using an electric precision rolling press (MSK-2150, MTI Corporation, Richmond, CA, USA) at room temperature with a constant calendering speed of 35 mm/s. The average porosity of the thick-film NMC 622 electrodes was adjusted to 35%, while the thicknesses of thin-film cathodes were reduced by 10–15%. The porosity of the electrodes was calculated based on the weight and density of each component [
