<p>Commercially available NMC 622 powder (BASF SE, Ludwigshafen, Germany) with a particle size of 12.8 µm (D90) was used as an active material for cathode, while carbon black C-NERGY Super C65 (Imerys G &amp; C Belgium, Willebroek, Belgium) was used as a conductive additive. Na-CMC (CRT 2000PA, Doe Wolff Cellulosic, Bomlitz, Germany) with a substitution degree (the average number of substituent groups attached per base unit) of 0.82–0.95 and water-based fluorine acrylic copolymer latex TRD 202A (JSR Micro NV, Leuven, Belgium) were applied as binders for aqueous electrode preparation. The electrode slurries were mixed in a dissolver equipped with a vacuum pump (CDS, VMA-Getzmann, Reichshof, Germany). NMC 622, carbon black, and deionized water were added into a premixed 5 wt.% CMC solution and were mixed under vacuum using 2000 RPM rotation speed for 20 min. After that, acetic acid was immediately added to the slurry in order to adjust the pH value. The slurry was further stirred for 5 min under vacuum using the same rotation speed as in the previous step, followed by 90 min mixing without vacuum. Finally, TRD 202A was added to the slurry and stirred with 500 rpm under vacuum for 3 min, since TRD 202A is shear sensitive. The solid components were adjusted to a mass ratio of NMC 622:carbon black:Na-CMC:TRD 202A = 100:2:2:3. The pH value of the slurry was measured 10 min after the mixing process was finished via a pH-Meter FE30-Basic FiveEasy (Mettler-Toledo GmbH, Giessen, Germany). The viscosity of the slurries was measured at room temperature with a rheometer (MCR 72, Anton Paar GmbH, Graz, Austria) using the rotational flow measurements with a parallel plate (PP 50, Anton Paar GmbH, Graz, Austria).</p>
