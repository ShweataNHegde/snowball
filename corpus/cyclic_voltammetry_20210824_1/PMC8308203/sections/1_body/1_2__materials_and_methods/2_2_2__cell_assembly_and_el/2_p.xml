<p>The “constant current–constant voltage” (CCCV) method was carried out for rate capability tests using a battery cycler (BT 2000, Arbin Instruments, College Station, TX, USA). The first 3 cycles were carried out at C/20 as the formation step, followed by increasing C-rates from C/10 to 5C. C/10 and C/5 were carried out for 5 cycles and the others were carried out for 10 cycles. The C-rate was calculated based on the discharge time and applied current during the formation step. In this work, 1C = 0.99 h
 <sup>−1</sup>, as well as a specific capacity of 155 mAh/g, were applied for the calculation of currents under different C-rates. The lower and upper cut-off voltages were 3.0 and 4.2 V, respectively. The CV measurements with a scan rate at 0.02 mV/s were carried out to find out the redox reaction that occurred during the charge and discharge processes. The operating window was set to 3.0 to 4.3 V. The electrochemical analyses were performed at room temperature in an ambient atmosphere.
