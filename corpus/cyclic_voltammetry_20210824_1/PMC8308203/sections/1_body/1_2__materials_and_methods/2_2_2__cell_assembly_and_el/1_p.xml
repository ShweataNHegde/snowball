<p>NMC 622 cathodes were assembled versus 0.25 mm lithium foil (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) in coin cells CR2032 in an argon-filled glove box (LAB master pro sp, M. Braun Intergas-Systeme GmbH, Garching, Germany) with H
 <sub>2</sub>O &lt; 0.1 ppm and O
 <sub>2</sub> &lt; 0.1 ppm. A mixture of ethylene carbonate and ethyl methyl carbonate (EC/EMC 3:7) with 1.3 M lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF
 <sub>6</sub>) as conducting salt and 5 wt.% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as additive was used as electrolyte. The separator was polypropylene (PP, Celgard, Charlotte, NC, USA) foil with a thickness of 25 µm and a diameter of 15 mm. A total amount of 120 µL electrolyte was added to the cell. After stacking, all cell components were pressed using a digital pressure controlled electric crimper (MSK-160D, MTI Corporation, Richmond, CA, USA). The assembled batteries were stored at room temperature for 20 h in order to allow the cathode and separator to be fully wetted with liquid electrolyte.
