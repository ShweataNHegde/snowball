 <p>Lithium-ion batteries have led the revolution in portable electronic devices and electrical vehicles due to their high gravimetric energy density. In particular, layered cathode material Li(Ni

  <sub>0.2</sub>Co
  <sub>0.2</sub>)O
  <sub>2</sub> (NMC 622) can deliver high specific capacities of about 180 mAh/g. However, traditional cathode manufacturing involves high processing costs and environmental issues due to the use of organic binder polyvinylidenfluoride (PVDF) and highly toxic solvent 
  <italic>N</italic>-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP). In order to overcome these drawbacks, aqueous processing of thick-film NMC 622 cathodes was studied using carboxymethyl cellulose and fluorine acrylic hybrid latex as binders. Acetic acid was added during the mixing process to obtain slurries with pH values varying from 7.4 to 12.1. The electrode films could be produced with high homogeneity using slurries with pH values smaller than 10. Cyclic voltammetry measurements showed that the addition of acetic acid did not affect the redox reaction of active material during charging and discharging. Rate capability tests revealed that the specific capacities with higher slurry pH values were increased at C-rates above C/5. Cells with laser structured thick-film electrodes showed an increase in capacity by 40 mAh/g in comparison to cells with unstructured electrodes.
