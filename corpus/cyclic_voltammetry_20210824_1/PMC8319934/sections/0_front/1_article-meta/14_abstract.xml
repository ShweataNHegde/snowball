 <p>Carbon nanosphere (CNS) electrodes are the candidate of sodium-ion battery (SIB) negative electrodes with small internal resistances due to their small particle sizes. Electrochemical properties of low-crystallized CNS electrodes in dilute and concentrated sodium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) amide/ethylene carbonate + dimethyl carbonate (NaTFSA/EC + DMC) were first investigated. From the cyclic voltammograms, both lithium ion and sodium ion can reversibly insert into/from CNSs in all of the electrolytes used here. The cycling stability of CNSs in concentrated electrolytes was better than that in dilute electrolytes for the SIB system. The interfacial charge-transfer resistances at the interface between CNSs and organic electrolytes were evaluated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. In the Nyquist plots, the semicircles at the middle-frequency region were assigned to the parallel circuits of charge-transfer resistances and capacitances. The interfacial sodium-ion transfer resistances in concentrated organic electrolytes were much smaller than those in dilute electrolytes, and the rate capability of CNS electrodes in sodium salt-concentrated electrolytes might be better than in dilute electrolytes, suggesting that CNSs with concentrated electrolytes are the candidate of SIB negative electrode materials with high rate capability. The calculated activation energies of interfacial sodium-ion transfer were dependent on electrolyte compositions and similar to those of interfacial lithium-ion transfer.</p>
