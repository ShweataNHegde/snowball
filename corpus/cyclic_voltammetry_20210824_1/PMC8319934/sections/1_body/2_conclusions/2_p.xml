<p>The interfacial sodium-ion transfer reaction at the interface between the CNS-1100 electrode and electrolyte solutions was investigated with comparison to the lithium-ion transfer reaction. From the cyclic voltammograms, both lithium ion and sodium ion can reversibly insert into/from CNS-1100 in all of the electrolytes. In the Nyquist plots, the semicircles at the high-frequency region and the middle-frequency region were assigned to the SEI resistance and the charge-transfer resistance, respectively. The activation energies of both interfacial lithium-ion and sodium-ion transfer resistances were also measured. The values of activation energies of both interfacial lithium-ion and sodium-ion transfer resistances were dependent on the composition of electrolytes. In addition, these values of the activation energies for amorphous CNS electrodes were close to those for graphitized CNS electrodes, suggesting that the activation energies of the interfacial sodium-ion transfer might be independent of the graphitization degree. The chargeâ€“discharge curves indicated the better rate capability of CNS-1100 and AB electrodes in sodium salt-concentrated electrolytes than in dilute electrolytes. To fabricate the SIBs with high rate capability, applying nanocarbonaceous negative electrodes with concentrated organic electrolyte solutions is one of effective approaches.</p>
