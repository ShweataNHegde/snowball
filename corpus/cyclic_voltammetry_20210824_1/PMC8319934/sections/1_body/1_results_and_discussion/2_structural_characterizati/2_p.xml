<p>First, the structure of CNS-1100 (CNS treated at 1100 °C) was investigated.

 <sup>–1</sup> and a G-band

 </xref> shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of CNS-1100 composite electrodes. CNS-1100 had a spherical shape indicating the coverage by bent basal planes derived from low graphitization degree, and the lithium ion or sodium ion intercalates into CNS-1100 from the surface of CNS. The solution structures of organic electrolytes were also investigated using Raman spectroscopy.
