 </xref> shows the Nyquist plots of the CNS-1100 composite electrode in 0.9 and 4 mol kg
 <sup>–1</sup> LiTFSA/EC + DMC (1:1 by vol). Two semicircles appeared at the high-frequency and the middle-frequency regions in 0.9 mol kg
 <sup>–1</sup> LiTFSA/EC + DMC (1:1 by vol). The semicircles at the high-frequency region or at the middle-frequency region were assigned to the parallel circuits of capacitances and SEI resistances or charge-transfer resistances, respectively, because only the semicircle at the high frequency was observed at open-circuit potential (OCV) after cyclic voltammetry (CV). Only one semicircle was observed at the middle-frequency region in 4 mol kg
 <sup>–1</sup> LiTFSA/EC + DMC (1:1 by vol). As for the concentrated electrolytes, this semicircle was assigned to the charge-transfer resistance. The SEI resistance seemed to be negligibly small in the concentrated electrolyte because the SEI on CNS electrodes in this concentrated electrolyte might have good passivation ability than in 0.9 mol kg
 <sup>–1</sup> LiTFSA/EC + DMC (1:1 by vol), and the SEI formation reaction might finish earlier and the thickness of SEI in the concentrated electrolyte might be thinner than in the dilute electrolyte, as previously reported for concentrated carbonate-based electrolytes.
