 <sup>–1</sup> LiTFSA/EC + DMC (1:1 by vol) was 56 kJ mol
 <sup>–1</sup>, which was near to the reported values for highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) and glassy carbon electrodes.

 </sup> In the previous reports regarding the lithium-ion transfer resistances of carbon negative electrodes, the differences in activation energies of charge-transfer resistances measured in different electrolytes corresponded to the differences of interaction between lithium ions and solvents by calculating the heats of solvating reaction, and the rate-determining step was considered to be the final desolvation process.

 </sup> Based on the previous reports,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>
 </sup> solvents seem to be difficult to cointercalate into the bulk of low-crystallized carbons and desolvation process should be necessary for lithium-ion insertion into CNS-1100. Hence, the rate-determining step in the lithium-ion transfer reaction between the CNS electrode and the dilute electrolyte seemed to be the final desolvation process of EC. The activation energy in 4 mol kg
 <sup>–1</sup> LiTFSA/EC + DMC (1:1 by vol) was 75 kJ mol
 <sup>–1</sup> and very large. We speculated that the kinetics of the interfacial lithium-ion transfer reaction in concentrated electrolytes is controlled by the interaction between the lithium ion and anion, which might be stronger than the interaction between lithium ions and neutral solvents. These results were consistent with the previous reports of graphitized CNS.
