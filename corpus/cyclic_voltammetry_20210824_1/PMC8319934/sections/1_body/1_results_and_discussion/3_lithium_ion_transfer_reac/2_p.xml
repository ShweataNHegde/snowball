 <sup>â€“1</sup> CNS-1100 composite electrodes in LiTFSA/EC + DMC. The irreversible currents were observed only in the 1st cycle, suggesting the formation of SEI on CNS electrodes in all of the electrolytes. The redox peaks also appeared in all of the electrolytes and were assigned to the reversible lithium-ion insertion into/from CNS-1100.
