<p>Finally, 
 <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure

 </xref> shows the charge–discharge curves of CNS-1100 and acetylene black (AB) composite electrodes in 0.9 and 4 mol kg
 <sup>–1</sup> NaTFSA/EC + DMC (1:1 by vol). At the first cycle, the irreversible capacity of the CNS electrode in the dilute electrolyte was larger than that in the concentrated electrolyte, indicating that the passivation ability of SEI in the concentrated electrolyte was better than in the dilute electrolyte like the case of the cyclic voltammograms. The maximum reversible capacity of CNS-1100 electrodes was around 145 mAh g
 <sup>–1</sup>. To evaluate the rate capability of CNS-1100 electrodes in both electrolytes, the reversible capacities were plotted against the cycling number, as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>
 </xref>c. Based on the result in 
 <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>
 </xref>c, the rate capability of CNS-1100 electrodes in the concentrated electrolyte under medium current densities was better than in the dilute electrolyte. These results also indicated that internal resistances of CNS-1100 electrodes in the concentrated electrolyte can be smaller than in the dilute electrolyte. Under the largest current densities, capacity loss in the concentrated electrolyte was almost the same as in the dilute electrolyte. This seemed to be because IR drops in the concentrated electrolyte were larger than in the dilute electrolyte due to the smaller electrolyte conductivity and so on. Hence, decreasing the activation energies of charge-transfer resistances and increasing electrolyte conductivities in concentrated electrolyte systems are desired to fabricate the high-rate sodium-ion battery in the future.
