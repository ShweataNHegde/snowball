 <sup>â€“1</sup> NaTFSA/EC + DMC (1:1 by vol). At least one semicircle was observed at the middle-frequency region in all of the electrolytes. This semicircle at the middle-frequency region was assigned to the parallel circuits of charge-transfer resistances and capacitances like the cases of previous literatures.

 </sup> The SEI resistance seemed to be negligible in the concentrated electrolytes because the amounts of SEI formation might also be minimized due to the best stability of SEI. In addition, only the interfacial sodium-ion transfer resistances in concentrated electrolytes were as small as the interfacial lithium-ion transfer resistances. The origin of the small interfacial resistance in the concentrated electrolyte might be derived from the high stability of SEI to prevent degradation of electrodes and large activity of sodium ion in concentrated electrolytes, which leads to large prefrequency factors. These results indicated that CNS-1100 negative electrodes in concentrated electrolytes can be the candidate of negative electrodes with high rate capability in SIBs.
