 </xref> shows the CVs of CNS-1100 composite electrodes in 0.9 and 4 mol kg
 <sup>â€“1</sup> NaTFSA/EC + DMC (1:1 by vol). The irreversible currents were observed in all of the electrolytes, and most of the irreversible currents disappeared from the 2nd cycle, indicating the formation of SEI on CNS electrodes in the same manner of the lithium-ion system. The redox peaks also appeared in all of the electrolytes and were assigned to the reversible sodium-ion insertion into/from CNS-1100. However, redox peaks in the dilute EC-based electrolyte decreased during cycling. This seemed to be because the SEI in the SIB system is easier to dissolve into electrolytes than that in the LIB system.

 </sup> CNS has a large surface area owing to the small particle size, and the dissolution of SEI and degradation due to continuous electrolyte decomposition might be much severe. On the other hand, the redox peaks in concentrated electrolytes did not decrease during cycling, suggesting that the stability of SEI in concentrated electrolytes is the best. These results might be because the dissolution of SEI and the continuous electrolyte decomposition were the most minimized by the saturation of the high-salt-concentration electrolyte.
