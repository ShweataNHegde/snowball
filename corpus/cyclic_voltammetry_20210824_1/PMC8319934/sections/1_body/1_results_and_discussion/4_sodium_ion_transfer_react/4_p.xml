 </xref> shows the temperature dependence of charge-transfer reactions of CNS-1100 composite electrodes in 0.9 and 4 mol kg
 <sup>–1</sup> NaTFSA/EC + DMC (1:1 by vol). The activation energy in 0.9 mol kg
 <sup>–1</sup> NaTFSA/EC + DMC (1:1 by vol) was 56–64 kJ mol
 <sup>–1</sup>. On the other hand, the activation energy in 4 mol kg
 <sup>–1</sup> NaTFSA/EC + DMC (1:1 by vol) was 68–69 kJ mol
 <sup>–1</sup> and very large. These values of activation energies were close to those of graphitized CNS electrodes.

 </sup> Hence, the electrolyte dependency of activation energies of interfacial sodium-ion transfer seemed to be universal for carbonaceous electrodes independent of the graphitization degree. The activation energies of the interfacial sodium-ion transfer might be dependent on the interaction between sodium ions and solvents or anions. However, the rate-determining step of the interfacial sodium-ion transfer might not be the simple desolvation process but the multiple process because these values of activation energies of interfacial sodium-ion transfer were much larger than the expected values of activation energies decided by the simple desolvation process based on the weak Lewis acidity of sodium ion. Considering the large activation energies of sodium-ion transfer resistances in concentrated electrolytes, decreasing the activation energies is desired in the future to decrease the interfacial resistances due to changing the salt anions and so forth.
