<p>In this study, the interfacial sodium-ion transfer resistances and the activation energies of sodium-ion transfer reaction at the interface between amorphous CNS electrodes and EC-based organic electrolyte solutions were measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The EC-based electrolyte with ordinal concentration was first used because it is the most common organic electrolyte. The EC-based electrolyte with high salt concentration was also used to make SEI more stable and prevent degradation, as reported in previous studies.
