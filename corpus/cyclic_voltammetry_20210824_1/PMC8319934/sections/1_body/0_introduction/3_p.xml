<p>As for the batteries of EVs, high rate capability is also desired. Carbon nanosphere (CNS) is expected as the candidate for carbon negative electrode materials with high rate capability and good cycling stability because CNS has small particle sizes, short diffusion distances, and the basal planes covering the surface.

 </sup> To enhance the rate capability of electrode materials, the resistance of electron transfer in composite electrodes, the resistance of ion diffusion in composite electrodes, the resistance of ion diffusion inside the electrode material, and the resistance of interfacial ion transfer should be considered.

 </sup> To analyze each resistance inside batteries, electrochemical alternating current impedance spectroscopy is the specific tool because processes with different relaxation times can be divided by impedance spectroscopy.

 </sup> Based on these results, the interfacial lithium-ion transfer is especially the significant rate-determining step. The interfacial sodium-ion transfer at the interface between electrodes and electrolytes is also expected to be the significant step. However, the kinetic properties of interfacial sodium-ion transfer at the interface between the CNS electrode and electrolyte are still not fully understood.
