<p>The use of RTIL is supported by several crucial factors, which include low volatility, high concentration of redox-active species, high energy density, electrochemical and thermal stability so they can be used at moderate and even high temperatures. Here we reported the successful synthesis of (BMIM)(HSQ) bearing the electrochemically active hydroquinone sulfonate as an anion. The electrochemical characterization was performed on the sole RAIL with no other additives or solvents, revealing a diffusion driven electrochemical redox process, affected by a fairly slow kinetic. Replacement of the halide (chloride) anion with an organic (HSQ) anion resulted, as expected, in a lower water content of the final IL (higher hydrophobicity), together with a higher viscosity and higher thermal stability. This study demonstrates that ILs can be functionalized to include simple redox active species; thus, the RAILs can be used without any additional supporting electrolyte or additives. Of course, further studies are needed on the application of our system into electrochemical devices. For instance, studying the behavior of this novel RAIL with different electrode materials, including both carbonaceous and noncarbonaceous, will result in very useful findings. In this regard, we have already conducted an initial study using carbon paper as working electrode (JNTG carbon paper), which gave similar results compared to glassy carbon and the preliminary voltammograms are reported in the
