<p>In the future, the use of molecular engineering will add a further step to this study by modifying the anion/cation in order to achieve an optimum system with comparable stability but lower viscosity. Clearly, the flexibility and the possibility of designing a large number of hydroquinone-containing RTILs offer great opportunities for the development of new or improved electrochemical technologies, and the field is still widely open for further explorations and studies.</p>
