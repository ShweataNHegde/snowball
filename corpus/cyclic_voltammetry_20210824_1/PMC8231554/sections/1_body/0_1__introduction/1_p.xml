<p>Over the past two decades, ionic liquids (ILs) have received a great deal of attention, and extensive work has been devoted to developing their practical applications in various fields [

 <xref rid="B3-materials-14-03259" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The unique property of ionic liquids that makes them environmentally suitable for these purposes is their intrinsic low vapor pressure, which has significant advantages when replacing highly volatile organic solvents [

 <xref rid="B5-materials-14-03259" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], where they demonstrated their versatility and large range of applicability, not only as excellent solvents but, in many cases, in a more active role. For example, in the synthesis of porous materials (including zeolites and metal organic frameworks (MOFs)), ILs act as templates or structure directing agents, in addition to their principal role as reaction solvent [

Some physical and chemical key properties of ILs that make them attractive for many applications include their solubility and miscibility with water and many other solvents, intrinsic ionic conductivity, broad electrochemical potential window, good thermal stability, and very high boiling points [
