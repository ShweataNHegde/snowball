<p>ILs have widely been investigated as potential safe electrolytes for many electrochemical devices, and there are many reports on IL-based redox systems [
 <xref rid="B20-materials-14-03259" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. While some success was indeed achieved in terms of safety and increased cell voltages [
 <xref rid="B21-materials-14-03259" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-materials-14-03259" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], the issue of solubility for these redox materials is still a major challenge [
 <xref rid="B7-materials-14-03259" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In this context, RAILs present an elegant approach for increasing the concentration of redox active species in electrolytes, while overcoming the issue of poor solubility. This strategy extends the practicability of ILs beyond they mere role of inert electrolytes.
