<p>As part of our research interest in developing this burgeoning area further, we here report the synthesis and characterization of a new electrochemically active ionic liquid, 1-butyl-3-methyimidazolium hydroquinone sulfonate ((BMIM)(HQS)), having the redox species hydroquinone sulfonate as the anion. The studied RAIL result liquid at room temperature and characterized by a low water content. The electrochemical response of the developed RAIL was investigated at a wide range of temperatures, ranging from 20 to 70 Â°C, without any additional supporting electrolyte or additives. Viscosity and thermogravimetry analysis confirmed the high stability and low volatility of (BMIM)(HQS).</p>
