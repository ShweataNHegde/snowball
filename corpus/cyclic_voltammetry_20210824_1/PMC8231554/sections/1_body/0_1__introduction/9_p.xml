<p>Hydroquinone is a simple typical and important electroactive molecule well-known in fundamental electrochemistry research [

 <xref rid="B38-materials-14-03259" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The simplicity of the hydroquinone anion combined with a suitable cation may result in a RAILs that is liquid at room temperature (RT) with an optimum viscosity. This property is crucial in order to achieve solvent free electrochemical systems for many energy storage applications (such as redox flow batteries).
