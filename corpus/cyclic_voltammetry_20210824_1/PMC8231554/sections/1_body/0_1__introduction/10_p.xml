<p>Recently, the topic of redox-active ionic liquids (RAILs) has resulted in a tremendous increase in terms of publications. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-03259-f001">Figure 1</xref>a displays the recent references related to the RAIL field from 2007 to 2021, showing a constant and continual increase. Looking to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-03259-f001">Figure 1</xref>b, one might notice that the most influential disciplines are Chemistry, Materials Science, and Chemical Engineering with emergence in other closely related fields such as Energy. While the scientific articles are dominating this publication domain, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-03259-f001">Figure 1</xref>c, only a small percentage of reviews articles are available so far (~3.6% of the published documents), and it would be interesting to contribute to filling this critical gap.
