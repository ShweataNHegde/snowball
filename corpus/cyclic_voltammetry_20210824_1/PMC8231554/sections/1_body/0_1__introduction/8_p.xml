<p>While functionalizing ILs and introducing electroactive species is relatively straightforward, and might be easily accomplished using the common preparative methods for the synthesis of TSILs, [
 <xref rid="B31-materials-14-03259" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] developing RAILs add other requirements, which make their preparation very challenging. As a matter of fact, it is well known that a fairly narrow range of ILs structures are liquids at RT, and only a very few of the reported RAILs are liquids at RT [
