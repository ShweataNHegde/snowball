<p>In addition to the many advantages of ILs previously described, the appeal of ILs in electrochemical applications is driven by their three key features, namely (i) their ionic conductivity, (ii) their large electrochemical potential window, and (iii) their thermal stability. The large electrochemical window may prevent side reactions, and the thermal stability allows for operation over wide ranges of temperatures. Another important feature of ILs that has attracted academic interest is the possibility of rationally altering their physical and chemical properties by varying the anion or the cation elements, or by introducing specific functionalities into the cation and/or anion, also known as task specific ILs (TSILs). This property stimulated the electrochemistry community to design novel ILs where the structure can be tailored to include redox active species; hence, they can be used not only as electrolytes but also as redox species or redox shuttles [
