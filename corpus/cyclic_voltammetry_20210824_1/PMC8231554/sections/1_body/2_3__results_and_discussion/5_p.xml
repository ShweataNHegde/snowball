<p>The cyclic voltammograms depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-03259-f004">Figure 4</xref> show a clear dependence of the peak positions and peak current intensity on the temperature. It is clear that there is a significant reduction in peak potential separation (Î”E); hence, the kinetics were improved at higher temperatures, together with a significant increase in the peak current intensity as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-03259-f005">Figure 5</xref>. This indicates that increasing the temperature considerably reduces the viscosity of the IL, which allows for an increase in the diffusion rate of the active species.
