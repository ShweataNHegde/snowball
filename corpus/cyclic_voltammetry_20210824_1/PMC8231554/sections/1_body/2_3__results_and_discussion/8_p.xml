<p>The thermal stability of (BMIM)(Cl) and (BMIM)(HQS) was determined by thermo-gravimetric analyzer in order to know their upper temperature limit. (BMIM)(HQS) resulted in a better thermal stability than (BMIM)(Cl), based on the TGA graph in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-03259-f007">Figure 7</xref>. The onset of thermal decomposition started at 261 °C for (BMIM)(Cl), as previously reported in the literature [
 <xref rid="B45-materials-14-03259" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], whereas (BMIM)(HQS) started decomposing around 340 °C. This shows a high thermal stability for the RAIL here reported. It well established that anion type plays a major role in determining thermal stability, similar to determining the hydrophobicity of ILs [

 <xref rid="B47-materials-14-03259" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Previous investigations have reported that the thermal stability of ILs with different anions decreases with the increase of the coordinating nature, nucleophilicity, and hydrophilicity of the corresponding anion [
 <xref rid="B46-materials-14-03259" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This is in agreement with the difference of 80 °C in the onset temperature here measured in favor of HQS anion with respect to Cl
 <sup>−</sup>. Indeed, it is well known that ILs properties can be tuned by varying the cation or the anion or both. This work and several other previous theoretical and experimental studies [

 <xref rid="B53-materials-14-03259" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] clearly demonstrated that changing the ionic liquid anion greatly affects its physical properties (including viscosity, thermal stability, and melting point). As a matter of fact, in a study on several ionic liquids containing macrocyclic fragments [
 <xref rid="B49-materials-14-03259" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], it was clearly demonstrated that replacing the halide anions by TFSI anions considerably decrease the melting point of the resulting IL. Similarly in another study [
 <xref rid="B48-materials-14-03259" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], the ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethyl) phosphinate (BMIM (CF
 <sub>3</sub>)2PO
 <sub>2</sub>) did not show a melting point in the temperature range −120 to 100 °C; in contrast, BMIM TFSI has a melting point of −3 °C [
