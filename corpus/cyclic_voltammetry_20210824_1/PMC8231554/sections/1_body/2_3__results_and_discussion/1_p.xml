 <sup>1</sup>H NMR and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR confirm the molecular structure of (BMIM)(Cl), and NMR data are comparable with the literature [
 <xref rid="B40-materials-14-03259" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] (NMR spectra are reported in the 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-14-03259">ESI</xref>). The successful exchange of the chloride with hydroquinone sulfonate in (BMIM)(HQS) is clearly indicated in both 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR by the presence of the characteristic peaks of hydroquinone sulfonate with three additional peaks, observed in 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR of (BMIM)(HQS) in the range between 6.6–7.2 ppm, attributed to the aromatic protons in HQS. In addition to that, 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectrum illustrates the characteristic additional carbon peaks of hydroquinone sulfonate in the 110–160 ppm range. These results clearly demonstrate that the synthesis of (BMIM)(HQS) was successfully achieved. The 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR analysis for (BMIM)(HQS) revealed a strong attenuation of the NC
 <underline>H</underline>N peak (BMIM fragment) speculatively attributed to the acidity of this proton and accordingly a proton exchange with the HQS fragment or with the solvent.
