<p>Coulometric water content determination is primarily used for the determination of small amounts of water in the ppm range. In a coulometric titrator, electric current is used to generate the iodine needed for the Karl Fischer reaction. The current releases a stoichiometrically corresponding amount of iodine from the iodide-containing reagent. (BMIM)(Cl) is found to be highly hygroscopic and is more prone to quick hydration by absorbing moisture from the air. In contrast, (BMIM)(HQS) is more stable in air and does not absorb moisture, despite being soluble in water. This has been confirmed by the coulometric KF titration method. The moisture content in (BMIM)(HQS) was found to be 0.1% whereas (BMIM)(Cl) has been reported around 6.85% [
