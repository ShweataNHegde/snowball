<p>The incorporation of hydroquinone sulfonate as an anion in (BMIM)(HQS) was further confirmed using FT-IR. In the FT-IR, when infrared photons hit the sample, some wavelengths are absorbed while other pass through (i.e., transmitted). The resulting signal spectrum represent a footprint of the sample, with typical fingerprint signal for specific molecular functional groups. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-03259-f002">Figure 2</xref>, the IR spectrum for (BMIM)(HQS) shows the clear characteristic (S=O) peak located in the range of 1322 −1149 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and (S–O) peak at around 1072 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. In addition to that, the large broad peak in the range of 3400–3300 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> in (BMIM)(Cl) is not present in (BMIM)(HQS). The presence of this specific peak usually refers to an extensive H-bonding network between water molecules and the imidazolium cations [

As chloride ions are silent towards NMR analysis, and the FT-IR spectra of the ILs here reported do not provide quantitative information, to estimate the purity of (BMIM)(HQS) we have performed gravimetric silver nitrate test. This revealed the presence of 3.8% mol/mol of chloride traces with respect to (BMIM)(HQS).
