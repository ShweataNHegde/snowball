<p>In general, when ΔE is higher than 600 mV, the hydroquinone/quinone system is considered quasireversible or slow. However, in this system, the active species (HQ/Q) are in the form of ionic liquid and, as explained above, the viscosity can greatly affect the cyclic voltammetry behavior. This can be demonstrated from the electrode response upon increased temperature. As temperature increases, ΔE decreases. This indicates that the system is reversible, but its electrochemical behavior is being affected by the viscosity. Furthermore, the HQ/Q redox couple is well known for its reversibility; nevertheless, such reversibility (the degree of the anodic and cathodic peak) strongly depends on the nature of the working electrode and electrolyte (medium). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-03259-f004">Figure 4</xref> shows the cyclic voltammograms of our system using various scan rate at 30 °C. It is evident that the peak current increases nonlinearly with an increasing the scan rate, suggesting a diffusion driven electrochemical redox process. This is not surprising, and a similar electrochemical behavior was reported on a family of metal-based ionic liquids [
