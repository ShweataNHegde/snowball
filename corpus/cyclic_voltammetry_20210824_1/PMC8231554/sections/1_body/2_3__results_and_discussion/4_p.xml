 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-03259-f003">Figure 3</xref> shows the cyclic voltammogram for (BMIM)(HQS) recorded at different temperatures. At room temperature (21 °C) the potential difference between the anodic peak and its associated cathodic peak (ΔE = 0.8 V) is high enough to indicate that the kinetic is fairly slow. Similar behavior was previously reported for the electrochemistry of hydroquinone dissolved in the non-active IL 1-butyl-3-methyimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (BMIM)(PF
 <sub>6</sub>) and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluroborate (BMIM)(BF
 <sub>4</sub>) [
