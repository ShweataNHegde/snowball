<p>As illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-03259-f006">Figure 6</xref>, the effect of increasing the temperature on the viscosity of (BMIM)(HSQ) was experimentally validated by measuring the viscosity of (BMIM)(HSQ) over the temperatures range 20–70 °C. The initial viscosity of 5640 mPa·s drastically dropped with increasing the temperature, reaching 186 mPa·s at 70 °C. This is a crucial factor to consider, since a redox flow battery is likely to be operated at different temperatures. The measured viscosities are anyway higher than those reported for imidazole-based ILs, which usually do not exceed the value of 160 mPa·s at 10 °C [
