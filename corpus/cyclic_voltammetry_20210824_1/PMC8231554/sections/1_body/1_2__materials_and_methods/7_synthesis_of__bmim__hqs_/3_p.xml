<p>Under inert atmosphere conditions, degassed butylchloride (77.64 g, 0.566 mol) was added to redistilled N-methylimidazole (39.64 g, 0.482 mol) with constant stirring. The mixture was refluxed at 70 Â°C for 72 h under nitrogen atmosphere. After completion, the reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature. Ethyl acetate was added, and the product was crystallized from the solution. It was filtered, washed with ethyl acetate, and dried under vacuum for 24 h yielding a white solid. Yield: 94%.</p>
