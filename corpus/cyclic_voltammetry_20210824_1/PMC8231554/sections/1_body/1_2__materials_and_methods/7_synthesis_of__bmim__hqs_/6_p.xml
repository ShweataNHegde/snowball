<p>(BMIM)(Cl) (24 g, 0.137 mol) was dissolved in 40 mL of methanol. After that, an excess of potassium hydroquinone sulfonate (36 g, 0.157 mol) was added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature (21 °C) for 72 h, after which the KCl precipitate was removed by filtration. Then dry acetone was added, and the precipitate was removed via filtration. This last step was repeated 3–4 times until no further precipitation was observed. Solvents were removed using rotavapor and the resulting product was dried under high vacuum at 60 °C for 24 h. Yield: 70%.</p>
