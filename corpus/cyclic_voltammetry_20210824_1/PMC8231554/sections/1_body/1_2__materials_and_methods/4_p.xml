<p>All electrochemical measurements were performed on SP-300 potentiostat controlled by EC-Lab software using a Three-electrode cell setup with a 5 mm diameter glassy carbon as working electrode, Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a platinum mesh counter electrode. Cyclic voltammetry was carried out using 10 mV/s scan rate and was performed at temperatures ranging from RT (21 °C) to 70 °C.</p>
