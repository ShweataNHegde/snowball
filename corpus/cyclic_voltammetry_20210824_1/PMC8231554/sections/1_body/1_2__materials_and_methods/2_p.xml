<p>Products were characterized using 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR, 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR, FT-IR and TGA. Samples for NMR analyses were prepared by dissolving 20 mg of the product in about 0.5 mL of deutrated solvent (CDCl
 <sub>3</sub>/CD
 <sub>3</sub>OD). NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE III HD 800 MHz NMR spectrometer (Billerica, MA, USA) equipped with a 5 mm BBO H&amp;F cryoprobe. NMR data were reported using the Aspinâ€“NMR Data Reporting Tool (V 1.0). [
 <xref rid="B39-materials-14-03259" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] FT-IR measurements were carried out using a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS50 FTIR spectrometer (Waltham, MA, USA), via the KBr pellets method. The mass of the products was recorded using Thermo Scientific TSQ Quantitativa Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (Waltham, MA, USA) by dissolving the samples in methanol.
