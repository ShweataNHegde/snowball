<p>The thermal stability of the products was examined by the thermogravimetric analyzer TA SDT Q600 TGA (New Castle, DE, USA). Samples were heated over temperatures between 20 to 600 °C under an oxygen atmosphere at a heating rate of 20 °C/min. In addition, melting point was measured with DSC-Q2000 (TA Instruments, New Castle, DE, USA) differential scanning calorimetry. The samples for DSC analysis were 10–20 mg; the heating and cooling rate was 10 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> over a temperature range of −70–+150 °C and the carrier gas was nitrogen. The samples were placed in an aluminum crucible. The DSC traces are reported in the
