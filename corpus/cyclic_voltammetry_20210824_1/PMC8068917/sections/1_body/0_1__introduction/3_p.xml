<p>Multielectron exchanges in this type of conversion reaction provide high-energy densities but also an insufficient cycling stability and large hysteresis due to their low electrical conductivity and significant volume changes during cycling. The development of materials with an adequate pore distribution and interconnectivity is essential to overcome these constraints [
