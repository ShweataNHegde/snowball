<p>Different articles in the literature have examined the possibility of combining NiO with other oxides [

 <xref rid="B15-nanomaterials-11-00966" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] in order to achieve a synergistic effect and improve its electrochemical performance as an electrode for Na-ion batteries. In addition, it has been shown that the low electrical conductivity of oxides usually makes it necessary to incorporate conductive materials such as carbon or noble metals in the fabrication of electrodes. Numerous examples exist in the literature about this approach combining various oxides, most commonly NiO, with carbon materials, both in nanometric and highly porous forms [
