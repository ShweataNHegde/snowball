<p>In the field of metal oxide electrode layers, M. C. López et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-nanomaterials-11-00966" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] evaluated a NiO thin film prepared by electrodeposition and thermal oxidation as a potential anode for Na-ion batteries. Although the first discharge showed a high-capacity value (around 800 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup>), the capacity retention was poor with substantial drops in this parameter after eight cycles. Another example consisted of thin films of transition metal oxides (NiO and Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>) prepared by electrodeposition [

 <sup>−1</sup> during the first cycle. From the knowledge gained in this work, it appears that improving the electrochemical behavior of the sodium batteries requires an efficient management of the oxide thin film’s porosity, a possibility that can be done straightforwardly with the magnetron sputtering (MS) technique under an oblique angle deposition configuration (MS-OAD) [
