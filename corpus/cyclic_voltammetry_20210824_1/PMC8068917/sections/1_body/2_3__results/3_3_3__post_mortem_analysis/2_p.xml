<p>In addition, we used confocal micro-Raman (CRM) coupled with Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) and integrated software tools of a NiO electrode after charge (NiO-3V) and discharge (NiO-0V) processes to investigate the redox mechanism. The Raman spectra of NiO thin films after charge and discharge are shown in
