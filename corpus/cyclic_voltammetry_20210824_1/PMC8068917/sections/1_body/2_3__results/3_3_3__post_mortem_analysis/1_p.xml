<p>To further test the hypothesis of a reduction in the NiO to metallic Ni while sodium becomes incorporated in the electrode during cycling (c.f., Equation (1)), we have investigated by XPS the state of the electrodes at different stages of the cycling process. The general spectra of the NiO-3V and NiO-0V samples, as taken from the electrochemical cell, revealed the presence of a high concentration of Na, Ni, and C, together with oxygen. The first analysis of the characteristic zone spectra of these elements confirmed that sodium (i.e., Na (1s) band) was in a cationic form and carbon (C1s peak) had a complex shape with two main components attributable, respectively, to adventitious carbon (BE. 284.5 eV), due to contamination by exposure to air before the incorporation of the samples in the spectrometer chamber, and a carbonate-like species (road band around 289.3 eV), likely due to the carbonation of the sodium oxide/hydroxide incorporated in the electrodes according to (1) or from the electrolyte. Meanwhile, as reported in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00966-f002">Figure 2</xref>b, the Ni2p spectra in these samples presented a complex shape, resulting from the contribution of Ni
 <sup>0</sup> and Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> species and characterized by the Ni2p3/2 main contributions at approximately 852.5 and 856.0 eV, respectively [
 <xref rid="B39-nanomaterials-11-00966" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Due to the exposure of the electrodes to air before their analysis by XPS, the detected partial oxidation of nickel at the surface of these samples might be due to air oxidation. To avoid this problem and to reduce surface contamination effects, we subjected to samples to a mild Ar
 <sup>+</sup> sputtering treatment (see experimental section for details) that, under the working conditions of the calibrated ion gun, is equivalent to the removal of the outmost 5 nm surface layer. We assume that the spectra after this mild sputtering are a better representation of the chemical state and composition of the bulk of the electrodes. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00966-f007">Figure 7</xref>a shows that in the NiO-0V sample, the shape of the Ni2p spectrum after sputtering corresponds to that of Ni
 <sup>0</sup>, while in the NiO-3V sample, the spectrum (

 <sup>0</sup> and NiO [
 <xref rid="B41-nanomaterials-11-00966" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Interestingly, the Ni/Na atomic ratio determined from the analysis of the spectra presented values of 0.35 and 3.35 for the NiO-0V and NiO-3V samples, respectively. These values support a considerable incorporation of sodium in the bulk of the electrodes in the NiO-0V sample where, in agreement with Equation (1), nickel appears in a metallic form. In the NiO-3V sample, the amount of incorporated sodium is much smaller, very likely corresponding to a residual amount of sodium ions that remains in the electrode, likely causing the progressive decrease in performance indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00966-f004">Figure 4</xref>,

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00966-f006">Figure 6</xref>. In agreement with the residual character of the sodium remaining in this electrode, the chemical state is a mixture of Ni
 <sup>0</sup> and NiO (note that the relative amount of Ni
 <sup>0</sup> is likely enhanced due to the partial reduction of NiO to Ni
 <sup>0</sup>, known to occur when NiO is subjected to Ar
 <sup>+</sup> bombardment [
