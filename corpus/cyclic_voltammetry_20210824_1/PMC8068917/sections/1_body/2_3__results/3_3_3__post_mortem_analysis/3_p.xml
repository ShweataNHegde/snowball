<p>The spectra of the charged NiO thin film are quite similar to those of the as-prepared NiO (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00966-f002">Figure 2</xref>d), since the Na ions leave the electrode while Ni is oxidizing. However, the discharged NiO thin film presents significant differences that justified a more in-depth study of this sample. The Raman image of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00966-f008">Figure 8</xref>b is an XY surface mapping of the discharged NiO electrode (NiO-0V) where two different spectra can be observed and combined in a color-coded image. Both color zones, blue and red, correspond to the curves of the same color in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00966-f008">Figure 8</xref>c. The blue zone and spectra clearly reveal a minority region showing four peaks that can be discerned in the spectra at 466, 621, 820, and 1093 cm

 <xref rid="B37-nanomaterials-11-00966" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Two vibration modes, the small and narrow peak at 200 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, related to a one-phonon excitation, and the band, related to a two-magnon excitation at 1457 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, have disappeared in comparison with the results for the as-prepared NiO electrode. The red spectrum shows two vibration bands at 621 and 1093 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> related to Ni, and an intense Raman peak at 278 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> that can be indexed to the Ni–Na mode [
