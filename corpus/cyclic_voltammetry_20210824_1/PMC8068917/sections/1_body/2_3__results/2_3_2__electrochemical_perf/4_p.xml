<p>The curves show a performance similar to that observed during the cycling at 400 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>, with a decrease in the capacity. The explanation relies again on the incomplete reversibility of the conversion between NiO and Ni
 <sup>0</sup>. In this case, as a result of the higher discharge and charge rates, the value of the discharge capacity after 40 cycles was 169 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup>. This same sample, after the 40 charge–discharge cycles at 1000 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>, was evaluated at 1200 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup> for 50 cycles and then at 800 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup> for 50 cycles (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00966-f005">Figure 5</xref>b) in order to analyze the stability of the electrode. The observed continuous reduction in the discharge and charge capacity values is attributed to the certain partial irreversibility of the Na
 <sup>+</sup> ion during the insertion–extraction process.
