<p>The first cathodic scan of the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00966-f003">Figure 3</xref>) shows two peaks located at 0.55 and 0.30 V. These peaks can be associated with the conversion reaction of NiO to Ni
 <sup>0</sup>, the precipitation of Na
 <sub>2</sub>O, and the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) at the surface of the NiO electrode [

 <xref rid="B22-nanomaterials-11-00966" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These cathodic peaks decrease in intensity with the cycle’s number, indicating the end of the SEI formation and the stabilization of the Na
 <sup>+</sup> insertion-extraction processes. A similar behavior was observed [
 <xref rid="B10-nanomaterials-11-00966" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], associating the irreversible sodium-ion consumption to side reactions of the formation of the SEI layer. These assignments of the different peaks of the cyclic voltammetry also correlate to those of ultrathin NiO nanosheets (4–5 nm in thickness) synthesized via a solvothermal process followed by annealing in air [
 <xref rid="B16-nanomaterials-11-00966" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Meanwhile, the anodic scans show a very wide band at around 1.4 V, assigned to the conversion of Ni
 <sup>0</sup> to NiO and Na
 <sub>2</sub>O to Na
 <sup>0</sup>, and a feature close to 3.0 V during the first two cycles, possibly associated with the interaction of the liquid electrolyte with the sodium anode based on the relative stability of the carbonate solvents at high voltages. After the first cycle, the CV curves are very similar, indicating an adequate electrochemical reversibility with these measurement conditions.
