 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00966-f006">Figure 6</xref>). The figure shows the trend already observed in the previous figures with a rapid reduction in the capacity with the number of cycles. This decrease is particularly well-observed up to approximately 300 cycles and is possibly due to the aforementioned continued reduction in the amount of available NiO. In the last 150 cycles, the capacity values remain almost constant, which could be associated with a stabilization of the redox reactions at the electrode surface.
