<p>The galvanostatic discharge–charge curves (capacities vs. voltage) at 1000 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup> between 0.010 and 3.000 V (vs. Na
 <sup>+</sup>/Na) are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00966-f005">Figure 5</xref>a. This sample was previously charged–discharged three times at 400 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup> in order to consolidate the SEI before evaluating the cycling behavior at 1000 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>.
