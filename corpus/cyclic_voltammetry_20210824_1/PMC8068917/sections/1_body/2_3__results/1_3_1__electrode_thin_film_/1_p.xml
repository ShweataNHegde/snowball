<p>SEM micrographs of the NiO MS-OAD thin film deposited on silicon for both the cross-section and planar views are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00966-f001">Figure 1</xref>a,b, respectively. This NiO film exhibits a columnar microstructure with nanocolumns tilted at 71Â° with respect to the normal surface. The nanocolumns are about 560 nm in length and 75 nm in diameter and are separated by large voids and pores. It is worth noting that the presence of the tilted orientation of these nanocolumns is a characteristic feature of MS-OAD thin films, as a result of the enhancement of shadowing effects at the nanoscale during the deposition process [
