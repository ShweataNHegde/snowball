<p>The RBS experimental and simulated curves of the NiO MS-OAD are displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00966-f002">Figure 2</xref>a. RBS confirms the homogeneous distribution of nickel and oxygen atoms throughout the whole filmâ€™s thickness and the completely oxidized state of nickel, i.e., NiO. This is also confirmed by the Ni2p photoelectron spectrum of the as-prepared sample (
