<p>The density of the NiO MS-OAD thin film can be estimated using the mass thickness determined by RBS (i.e., the number of atoms per cm
 <sup>2</sup>) and the thickness can be determined from the SEM cross-section image (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00966-f001">Figure 1</xref>a). The calculated film density, 3.67 g cm
 <sup>−3</sup>, yields an estimated porosity of ca. 45% of the total volume. The XRD pattern of the NiO MS-OAD film is depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00966-f002">Figure 2</xref>c. The main diffraction peaks appear at 37.1°, 43.2°, 62.8°, 74.9°, and 79.2° and are assigned to NiO (JCPDS card no. 44-1049).
