<p>NiO thin films (560 nm thick) have been successfully prepared by magnetron sputtering (MS) deposition under an oblique angle configuration (OAD). NiO films show a columnar microstructure of about 75 nm in diameter, separated by large voids and pores. This architecture facilitates the diffusion of sodium ions as the electrolytes can penetrate into the empty spaces, and it accommodates the volume changes caused by the successive charge and discharge cycles. XPS and a micro-Raman analysis of the charged and discharged samples have confirmed the reversibility of the conversion reaction of NiO with sodium ions. The results of the electrochemical study indicate the high discharge capacities of NiO films during the first cycle at different current intensities. However, the continuous reduction in capacity with the number of cycles is a consequence of a limited reversibility in the charge-discharge cycling, as demonstrated by XPS and the micro-Raman analysis. The accessibility to NiO particles inside the nanocolumns with a well-defined porous structure could improve the electrochemical behavior of these electrodes. On the other hand, an enhancement of the electrical conductivity (not considered in this paper) should also lead to higher capacity values.</p>
