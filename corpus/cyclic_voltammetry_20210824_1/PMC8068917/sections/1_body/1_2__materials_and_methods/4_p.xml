<p>The Raman analysis was carried out using a confocal micro-Raman (Witec alpha-300R) with a laser excitation of 532 nm and a 100× objective lens (NA = 0.9) for coatings deposited on Cu substrates. The optical resolution of the confocal microscope is limited to 200 nm laterally and 500 nm vertically, while the Raman spectral resolution is limited to 0.02 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The spectra were acquired using the as-prepared samples and after their electrochemical characterization (at the full-charge and discharge electrodes).
