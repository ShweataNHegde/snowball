<p>The characterization of the NiO samples by XPS was carried out both for their “as-prepared” state and after their usage as electrodes. In this case, two samples were selected for analysis. A NiO-3V sample was taken from the electrochemical cell after cycling the voltage several times with the voltage set at 3V. Under these conditions, it is assumed that the electrode was “charged” and the Equation (1) set to the left. A NiO-0V sample was taken out from the cell after the same number of cycles but in a “discharged” state as expected by the fact that the applied voltage at that moment was 0.01 V (Equation (1) was displaced to the right). These samples were carefully handled after removing them from the electrochemical cell inside the glove box: they were soaked in propylene carbonate; carefully dried; and stored in a desiccator until they were introduced to the XPS analysis chamber. These electrodes were analyzed before and after a mild sputtering treatment with Ar
 <sup>+</sup> ions of 1000 eV kinetic energy. The utilized ion dose, as calibrated with a standard, was equivalent to that required to remove a layer of approximately 5 nm thickness in the case of homogeneous and compact samples.
