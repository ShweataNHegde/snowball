<p>The microstructure of the films deposited on doped silicon (100) wafers was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a Hitachi S4800 field emission microscope. The samples were diced for cross-sectional analysis. Rutherford backscattering (RBS) spectra were recorded in a tandem accelerator (Centro Nacional de Aceleradores, Universidad de Sevilla, Spain) with α particles of 2.0 MeV, a passivized implanted planar silicon (PIPS) detector located at a 165° scattering angle, with a beam current and diameter of 1.7 nA and ~1 mm, respectively. The spectra were analyzed with the SIMRA6.0 program. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), taken to chemically characterize the surface of the samples, were recorded in a PHOIBOS spectrometer working in the constant-pass energy mode at a value of 20 eV. The binding energy (BE) scale of the spectra was referenced to the C1s peak of the spurious carbon contaminating the surface of the samples at a value of 284.5 eV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a Panalytical X’Pert Pro diffractometer with Bragg–Brentano geometry and an X’Celerator detector. The diffraction patterns were recorded from 30° to 120° (2θ) with a step size of 0.05° and a counting time of 300 s per step. The analysis was performed using the X’Pert HighScore Plus software.</p>
