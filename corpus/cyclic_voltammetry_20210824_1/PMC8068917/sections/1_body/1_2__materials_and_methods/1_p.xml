<p>NiO thin films were prepared by reactive pulsed Direct Current DC MS-OAD using a nickel target of 50 mm diameter and 0.3 mm thickness. The magnetron head was operated at a power of 200 W and a pulsed voltage of 550–600 V at a frequency of 80 kHz. The base pressure in the chamber prior to the deposition and during the deposition was 3 × 10
 <sup>−6</sup> and 5 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> mbar, respectively. The plasma gas consisted of an O
 <sub>2</sub>/Ar mixture at a mass flow ratio of 0.06. The angle between the target, in a horizontal and upper position, and the perpendicular substrate was 80° and the distance between the center of the target and the substrates 10 cm. Silicon, soda lime glass, and high mirror-polished copper were used as substrates to carry out different characterization studies as indicated in the text.
