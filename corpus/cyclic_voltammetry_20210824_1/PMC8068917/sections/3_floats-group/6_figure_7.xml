  <p>The Ni2p photoelectron spectra of the NiO-0V sample (
   <bold>a</bold>) and the NiO-3V sample (
   <bold>b</bold>) before (thin black line) and after (red thick line) a mild sputtering with Ar+. (Note that the spectra before sputtering have been multiplied by the factors indicated in the plot). The Ni2p3/2 features associated with Ni
   <sup>0</sup> and Ni
   <sup>2+</sup> and a satellite that is particularly intense for the Ni
   <sup>2+</sup> species (marked with an asterisk) are highlighted in the plots.
