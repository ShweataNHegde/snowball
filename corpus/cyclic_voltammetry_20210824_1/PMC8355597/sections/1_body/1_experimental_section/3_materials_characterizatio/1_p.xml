<p>The morphologies and microstructures of samples were observed on field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4800) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F30) equipped with an energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) detector. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on Rigaku Ultima IV powder X-ray diffractometer by using Cu Kα radiation (
 <italic>λ</italic> = 0.15418 nm). Raman spectra were performed by Renishaw In
 <italic>Via</italic> Raman spectrometer (
 <italic>λ</italic> = 532 nm). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on SDT Q600 analyzer (TA Instruments) under a flowing Ar atmosphere.
