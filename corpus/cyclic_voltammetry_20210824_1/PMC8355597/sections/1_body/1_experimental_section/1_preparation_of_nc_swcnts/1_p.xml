<p>Melamine foam (3 cm × 3 cm × 3 cm) was washed with anhydrous ethanol and dried in an oven at 80°C for 12 h, then immersed in SWCNTs/NMP suspension (0.4%). After 6 h, the melamine foam impregnated with SWCNTs/NMP suspension was taken out and dried in a vacuum oven at 80°C for 24 h to obtain the precursor of melamine/SWCNTs. The above precursor was calcined at 700°C under flowing N
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere for 3 h to obtain NC@SWCNTs host.
