The pre-mixed Se and S mixture was obtained after ball milling (500 rpm) for 12 h. Subsequently, 0.6 g pre-mixed Se and S mixture and a piece of NC@SWCNTs (3 cm × 3 cm × 3 cm, ∼0.4 g) were put into a stainless-steel jar. Then, CO
 <sub>2</sub> was pumped into the jar until the gaseous pressure reached 8.5 MPa. After the jar was kept at 32°C for 24 h, NC@SWCNTs@Se
