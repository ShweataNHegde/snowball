 </sub> cathodes at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup> in the potential window from 1.0 to 3.0 V versus Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup>. At the initial scan, a sharp reduction peak at ∼1.38 V, a small reduction peak at ∼2.37 V, and a broadened oxidation peak at ∼2.14 V are clearly observed. The small reduction peak at ∼2.37 V disappears after the first scan, while the sharp reduction peak at ∼1.38 V shifts to ∼1.7 V during the subsequent scan. The peak shift indicates the activation process during the first lithification process, and the polarization is effectively reduced thereafter (

 </sub> cathodes are obviously different from S cathode, indicating the introduction of Se changes the electrochemical reaction process of S that is conducive to its stable work in carbonate-based electrolytes. Moreover, galvanostatic charge-discharge curves (

 </sub> cathodes are consistent with CV results. During the first discharge process, there are two plateaus: one is an extremely short plateau at ∼2.38 V, and another is a long plateau at ∼1.75 V. In the subsequent cycles, the short plateau at ∼2.38 V disappears, while the long plateau at ∼1.75 V becomes a little steeper and shifts to ∼1.88 V. The short plateau at ∼2.38 V is attributed to the transformation of Se

 <sub>0.8</sub> to polysulfides/polyselenides intermediates. And the disappearance of the short plateau is probably due to the dissolution of intermediates into the electrolyte (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Meanwhile, the long plateau at 1.75–1.88 V is assigned to the conversion of polysulfides/polyselenides to Li
