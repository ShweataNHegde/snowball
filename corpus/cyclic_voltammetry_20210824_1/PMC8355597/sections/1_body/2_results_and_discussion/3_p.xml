 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, all the samples have a wide peak in 2θ ranging from 15 to 40
 <sup>o</sup>, corresponding to the existence of NC@SWCNTs. Meanwhile, the characteristic diffraction peaks of Se and S are clearly observed in NC@SWCNTs@Se and NC@SWCNTs@S samples, respectively. With the introduction of Se, no characteristic diffraction peak of Se is detected in NC@SWCNTs@Se

 </sub> composites. However, some characteristic diffraction peaks of S with low intensity can be still observed, indicating a small amount of Se may occupy S position and further form Se

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>. Apparently, all the samples have three characteristic peaks located at 260, 375 and 470 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively, which are assigned to Se-Se, Se-S and S-S stretching vibrations, (
