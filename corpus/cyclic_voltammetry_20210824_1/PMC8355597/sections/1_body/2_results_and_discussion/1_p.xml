<p>The morphology and microstructure of NC@SWCNTs host are characterized by SEM and TEM as illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. As vividly depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s9">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>, NC@SWCNTs host exhibits a 3D honeycombed network structure, fully inheriting the 3D interconnected framework of melamine foam. Local magnification SEM images (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2B,C</xref>) demonstrate that numerous interlaced SWCNTs are covered the surface of melamine foam derived carbon skeletons, as well as SWCNTs are formed into small sheets between carbon skeletons. This unique interconnecting structure not only endows NC@SWCNTs a highly conductive 3D network to accelerate the electron/ion transport, but also effectively enhances the mechanical strength and flexibility of NC@SWCNTs host. Moreover, TEM results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>) further indicate that SWCNTs are crisscrossed in carbon skeletons, forming an intertwined 3D network structure. On the basis of EDS results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>), the main elements in NC@SWCNTs are C, O and N, which are uniformly distributed in NC@SWCNTs. Notably, N signal is derived from melamine foam since melamine has high content of N. According to the above analysis, NC@SWCNTs host has a typical 3D network structure that is composed of SWCNTs-coated N-doped carbon skeleton derived from melamine foam and wafery sheets interwoven by SWCNTs. The pores and layer gaps in NC@SWCNTs host are conducive to loading more Se

 </sub> active materials. Meanwhile, the 3D interconnected conductive network framework can not only effectively promote redox kinetics, but also endow NC@SWCNTs host with strong mechanical properties to buffer the volume expansion during cycling. Additionally, the doped N is also beneficial to the adsorption of intermediates.
