 <p>Selenium-sulfur solid solutions (Se

  </sub>) are considered to be a new class of promising cathodic materials for high-performance rechargeable lithium batteries owing to their superior electric conductivity than S and higher theoretical specific capacity than Se. In this work, high-performance Li-Se
  <sub>1-

  </sub>S
  <sub>
   <italic>x</italic>
  </sub> batteries employed freestanding cathodes by encapsulating Se

  </sub>S
  <sub>

  </sub> in a N-doped carbon framework with three-dimensional (3D) interconnected porous structure (NC@SWCNTs) are proposed. Se

  </sub>S
  <sub>
   <italic>x</italic>
  </sub> is uniformly dispersed in 3D porous carbon matrix with the assistance of supercritical CO
  <sub>2</sub> (SC-CO
  <sub>2</sub>) technique. Impressively, NC@SWCNTs host not only provides spatial confinement for Se

  </sub>S
  <sub>

  </sub> and efficient physical/chemical adsorption of intermediates, but also offers a highly conductive framework to facilitate ion/electron transport. More importantly, the Se/S ratio of Se
  <sub>1-
   <italic>x</italic>
  </sub>S
  <sub>

  </sub> plays an important role on the electrochemical performance of Li- Se

  </sub> batteries. Benefiting from the rationally designed structure and chemical composition, NC@SWCNTs@Se
  <sub>0.2</sub>S
  <sub>0.8</sub> cathode exhibits excellent cyclic stability (632 mA h g−1 at 200 cycle at 0.2 A g
  <sup>−1</sup>) and superior rate capability (415 mA h g
  <sup>−1</sup> at 2.0 A g
  <sup>−1</sup>) in carbonate-based electrolyte. This novel NC@SWCNTs@Se
  <sub>0.2</sub>S
  <sub>0.8</sub> cathode not only introduces a new strategy to design high-performance cathodes, but also provides a new approach to fabricate freestanding cathodes towards practical applications of high-energy-density rechargeable batteries.
