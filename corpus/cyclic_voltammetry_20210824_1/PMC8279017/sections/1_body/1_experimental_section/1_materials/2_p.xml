<p>The synthesis of the sulfur composite (S:Sn 80:20) was achieved in a previous work through a physical mixing and melting process of elemental sulfur (80% wt, ≥99.5%, Riedel-de Haën) and nanometric tin powder (20% wt, &lt;150 nm, ≥99% trace metal basis, Sigma-Aldrich) at 120 °C,

 </sup> while the LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub> (LFP) material was developed by advanced lithium electrochemistry (Aleees Taiwan, model A1100) and characterized by a carbon content of about 5%.
