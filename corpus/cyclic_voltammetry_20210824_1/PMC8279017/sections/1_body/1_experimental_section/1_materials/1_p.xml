<p>Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI, Sigma-Aldrich) and lithium nitrate (LiNO
 <sub>3</sub>, Sigma-Aldrich) salts were dissolved in diethylene-glycol dimethyl-ether (DEGDME, CH
 <sub>3</sub>O(CH

 <sub>3</sub>CH
 <sub>3</sub>, Sigma-Aldrich) solvents at room temperature overnight under magnetic stirring inside an Ar-filled glovebox (MBraun, O
 <sub>2</sub> and H
 <sub>2</sub>O content below 1 ppm). The final concentration of each salt was 1.5 mol kg
 <sub>solvent</sub>
 <sup>–1</sup> in DEGDME and 2 mol kg
 <sub>solvent</sub>
 <sup>–1</sup> in TREGDME, that is, amounts approaching the saturation limit of the solvents. Prior to use, LiTFSI and LiNO
 <sub>3</sub> were dried at 110 °C for 24 h under vacuum, while DEGDME and TREGDME solvents were dried under molecular sieves (3 Å, rods, size 1/16 in., Honeywell Fluka) until a water content lower than 10 ppm was achieved as measured by a 899 Karl Fischer coulometer (Metrohm). The highly concentrated electrolyte solutions are subsequently indicated as DEGDME_HCE and TREGDME_HCE. The analyses of the chemical and electrochemical properties of the electrolytes are reported in a previous work.
