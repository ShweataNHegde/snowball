 <p>The goal of this article is to highlight crucial breakthroughs in solid-state ionic conduction in borohydrides for battery applications. Borohydrides, M

  <sup>2+</sup>, which can participate in ionic conduction. This overview article will fully explore the phase space of boronâ€“hydrogen chemistry in order to discuss parameters that optimize these materials as solid electrolytes for battery applications. Key properties for effective solid-state electrolytes, including ionic conduction, electrochemical window, high energy density, and resistance to dendrite formation, are also discussed. Because of their open structures (for closo-boranes) leading to rapid ionic conduction, and their ability to undergo phase transition between low conductivity and high conductivity phases, borohydrides deserve a focused discussion and further experimental efforts. One challenge that remains is the low electrochemical stability of borohydrides. This overview article highlights current knowledge and additionally recommends a path towards further computational and experimental research efforts.
