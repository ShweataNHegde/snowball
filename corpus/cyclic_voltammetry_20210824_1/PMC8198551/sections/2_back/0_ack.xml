 <p>General support for early hydride work came from the NSF (grant # DMR1231153). Our use of the many reproductions of figures in preparation of this manuscript are attributed in citation, and use of these renderings is gratefully acknowledged. Data represented in these figures were approximated from the original works cited. Mention of particular commercial products or vendors in this paper is only intended to provide information and does not suggest recommendation or endorsement by the author or the authorâ€™s institution. It also does not imply that those products or vendors are necessarily the best available for the purpose or application. The author gratefully acknowledges those undergraduate students who collected data presented in this paper during their time at Rowan University: Jennifer Hildebrand for careful collection of the Raman data; Aaron Hopkins and Aadil Rathore for collection of the cyclic voltammetry and SEM data; and Frank Cifone, Andrew Cuje, Kyle Nemeth, and Jessica Wacker for preparation of the CSP pellet.</p>
