<p>In work documenting battery development by Scrosati, the timeline growth in lithium ion battery sales in various market sectors (i.e., HEV, cellular, notebooks, power tools, and camcorders) between 2000 and 2015 demonstrates the enormous potential of the technology to penetrate further into new markets [

There is a need for more research to understand key scientific barriers to the development of a new class of solid electrolyte materials, i.e., borohydrides. Ideal solid-state borohydride electrolytes will address the four scientific barriers of (i) low room temperature ionic conduction in the solid-state, (ii) formation of deleterious phases and dendrites at the electrolyte/anode interface, (iii) low electrochemical window (voltage range over which the phase is electrochemically stable), and (iv) low energy density owing to poor mechanical stability of thinner electrolytes. The development of new solid electrolytes could additionally lead to innovations in low temperature fuel cells (as well as safer ion conducting batteries). Boronâ€“hydrogen chemistry is versatile (forming bridge and cyclic structures), and this could lead to improved tunability in cationic conduction. Materials developments require a better understanding of scientific underpinnings in order to create new materials for all solid-state battery applications. Specifically, the knowledge gap yet to be addressed surrounds our understanding of which strategies for enhancing ionic mobility (i.e., additives, dopants, mixtures, adducts, and nanostructuring) ultimately perform best at enhancing solid-state diffusion in these materials.
