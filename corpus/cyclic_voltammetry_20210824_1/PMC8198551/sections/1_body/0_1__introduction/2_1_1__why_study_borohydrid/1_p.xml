<p>This overview article work seeks to provide discussion germane to materials based in the borohydride family for solid-state electrolyte applications. The development of borohydrides as a class of materials for use as solid electrolytes could lead to innovations in low temperature fuel cells and safer ion conducting batteries. This class of materials has not been fully explored experimentally or computationally for use as solid-state electrolytes. A review by Matsuo and Orimo published in 2011 describes fast ionic conduction in LiBH
 <sub>4</sub>, LiNH
 <sub>2</sub>, and LiAlH
 <sub>4</sub> systems (and their mixtures), providing a prospectus on improving room temperature ionic conduction [

 <xref rid="B8-molecules-26-03239" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. That comprehensive review is useful, and should be considered, for a very in-depth discussion of the ionic conductivity of borohydrides and carboranes as candidate solid-state electrolyte materials.
