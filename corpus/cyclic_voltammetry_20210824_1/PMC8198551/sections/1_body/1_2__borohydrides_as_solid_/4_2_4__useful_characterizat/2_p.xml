<p>Other advanced characterization techniques, such as quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS), which can deliver both structural information (such as H-H distances), diffusivities, and mechanism of motion (i.e., tumbling, hopping, etc.), should be considered when studying ionic mobility in borohydrides. Impedance spectroscopy was used to study superionic conduction in the Na
