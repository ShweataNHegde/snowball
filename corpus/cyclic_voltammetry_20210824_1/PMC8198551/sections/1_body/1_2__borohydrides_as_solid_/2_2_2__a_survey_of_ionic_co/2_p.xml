<p>The conductivity for Mg(BH

 <sub>2</sub> reaches ionic conductivity levels of 10
 <sup>−6</sup> S/cm at 150 °C [

 <xref rid="B42-molecules-26-03239" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This compares well with the highly researched Mg
 <sub>3</sub>(PO
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2,</sub> which has an ionic conductivity of 10
 <sup>−6</sup> S/cm at temperatures in excess of 400 °C. Another factor that is well known to affect ionic conduction in LiBH
 <sub>4</sub> is crystallographic phase. When measured above the orthorhombic to hexagonal phase transition (occurring at 130 °C), a higher ionic conduction is realized in the elevated temperature hexagonal phase [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-03239" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The lithium ion conductivity is realized in the hexagonal phase of LiBH
 <sub>4</sub> is 10
 <sup>−3</sup> S/cm [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-03239" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It will be useful to develop approaches to stabilize the elevated temperature phase down to room temperature. Work done by doping LiCa
 <sub>3</sub>(BH
 <sub>4</sub>)(BO
 <sub>3</sub>), formed by decomposing LiBH
 <sub>4</sub>, Ca(BH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> in the presence of carbon, has demonstrated a Li
 <sup>+</sup> conduction of 10
 <sup>−5</sup> S/cm at room temperature [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-26-03239" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The -BO
 <sub>3</sub> molecular unit is reported to define the transport pathway for the lithium ion [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-26-03239" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Additions of, Sr
 <sup>2+</sup>, Eu
 <sup>2+,</sup> and Na
 <sup>+</sup> have all demonstrated improved Li
 <sup>+</sup> conductivity when added to LiCa
 <sub>3</sub>BH
 <sub>4</sub>BO
 <sub>3</sub>. The larger-sized divalent substitutions, Sr
 <sup>2+</sup> and Eu
 <sup>2+</sup>, expand the lattice to enhance transport. The monovalent Na
 <sup>+</sup> substituting onto Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> O-sites also causes a lattice expansion when there is excess Li
