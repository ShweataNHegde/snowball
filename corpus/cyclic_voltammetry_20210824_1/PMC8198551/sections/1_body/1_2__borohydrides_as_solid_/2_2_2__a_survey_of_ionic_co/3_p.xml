<p>As noted earlier in this paper, the open structure of the closo-boranes (B
 <sub>n</sub>H
 <sub>n</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>) results in increased ionic conduction over the nido- BH
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>−</sup> units. In fact, closo-boranes realize ionic conductivities, which are five orders of magnitude higher than nido- structures. Other work has shown that rapid cationic conduction (3 × 10
 <sup>−2</sup> S/cm) occurs in the LiB
 <sub>10</sub>H
 <sub>10</sub> and NaB
 <sub>10</sub>H
 <sub>10</sub> phases [
