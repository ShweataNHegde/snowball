<p>Contemporaneous with work done using borohydrides inside of solvents, borohydrides in the closo-borane phases were being considered as superionic conductors for rapid ion motion through their open channel pore structures [

 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-03239" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Researchers doing theoretical work began to suggest that the superionic conduction would make closo-boranes promising for solid electrolytes [

 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-03239" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The reasons for this superionic conduction are described in the theory paper by Kweon et al. as a flat energy landscape (with many available sites for hopping), symmetry competition that ejects the cation from particular sites, and thermal reorientation of the anions [
