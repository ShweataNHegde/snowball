<p>A novel sandwiched alkaline polymer electrolyte membrane with high ionic conductivity and alkali resistance was prepared by solution-casting and solution polymerization approaches. The inner layer RDC served as the framework to improve the mechanical properties and alkali resistance, while the outer layers PAAK served as the conducting phase for ion transmission. The results showed that after the introduction of PAAK into the polymer electrolyte, the elongation at break increased from 52.50% to 82.13%, and the tensile strength was enhanced from 0.364 MPa to 0.455 MPa. A high ionic conductivity (0.25 Scm
 <sup>−1</sup>) and alkali resistance (8 M KOH) were achieved for the polymer electrolyte membrane. Furthermore, an electrochemical stability window of 2.0 V was measured via the cyclic voltammetry curve test. The prepared electrolyte membranes with the RDC/PAAK/KOH-based sandwich structure show promising potential in the application of Zn–Air batteries.
