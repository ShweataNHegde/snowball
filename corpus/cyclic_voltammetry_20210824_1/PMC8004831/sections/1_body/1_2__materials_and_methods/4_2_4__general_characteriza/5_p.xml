<p>The ionic conductivity of the RDC/PAAK/KOH alkaline polymer electrolyte was measured by an AC impedance method using an electrochemical impedance analyzer (CHI660E, Shanghai Chenhua Instruments Co., Shanghai, China) at room temperature, and the AC frequency was scanned from 10
 <sup>5</sup> to 10
 <sup>−2</sup> Hz with an amplitude of 5 mV. The samples with a diameter of 1 cm were sandwiched between two plates of stainless steel with a surface area of 0.785 cm
 <sup>2</sup> (SS|SPE|SS). The bulk resistance (Rb) was determined from the cross point of the Nyquist curve at the real axis. The calculation formula of ionic conductivity is σ = L/(Rb × A), where L, Rb, and A represent thickness (cm), bulk resistance (ohm), and area (cm
 <sup>2</sup>) of the sample, respectively.
