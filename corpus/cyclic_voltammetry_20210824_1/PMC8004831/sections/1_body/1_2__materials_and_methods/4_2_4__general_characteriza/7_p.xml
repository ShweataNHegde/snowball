<p>The charge–discharge performance of the battery was tested using LAND autocycler (CT2001A, Wuhan Blue Electrical Co., Wuhan, China). The extent of electric current for charging and discharging of Zn–Air cells was determined according to a calculation method J = (m − m0)*NC/A. Here, J was current density, m and m0 were the weight (g) of Zn electrode and nickel foam, respectively, N was multifarious values, C was theoretical specific capacity, and A was the area of alkaline polymer electrolyte membrane for Zn–Air battery.</p>
