<p>Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) measurements were carried out on an XRD diffractometer (XRD-6100, SHIMADZU Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The patterns with Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 30 mA were recorded in the 2θ region from 10° to 70°. Samples were soaked in liquid nitrogen for 10 min and then ground into pieces for the WAXD test.</p>
