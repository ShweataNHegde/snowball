<p>The molecular structures of alkaline polymer electrolyte membranes were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (NICOLET iS10, Madison, WI, USA) with ATR mode. Freeze-dried samples were ground into pieces and the IR spectra were recorded with a wavenumber resolution of 4 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> in the range of 500–4000 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. Here, air was selected as the background reference.
