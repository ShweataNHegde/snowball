<p>The electrochemical stability window was determined by a cyclic voltammetry curve which was tested using a CHI660E Electrochemical Workstation. The samples with a radius of 0.5 cm were placed between two plates of stainless steel (SS|SPE|SS). RDC/PAAK/KOH alkaline polymer electrolyte membranes were cycled in the voltage region of −1.5 V to 1.5 V with a scan rate of 10 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup> at 25 °C.
