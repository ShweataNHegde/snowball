<p>The mechanical properties of RDC/PAAK/KOH alkaline polymer electrolyte membranes were evaluated by a mechanical testing machine (WDL-005, Jinan Xinshijin Experimental Instrument Co., Jinan, China) with a crosshead speed of 20 mm/min. Specimens with a typical size of 30 mm × 11 mm (length × width) were used and coated with silicone wax to avoid water evaporation during the experiment.</p>
