<p>The assembly of the alkaline polymer electrolyte Zn–Air battery is schematically represented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-11-00224-f002">Figure 2</xref>, in which the solid-state Zn–Air cell consisted of a Zn electrode, RDC/PAAK/KOH alkaline polymer electrolyte, and air electrode. The above three parts were arranged and packaged into battery shells with micropores for the circulation of oxygen.
