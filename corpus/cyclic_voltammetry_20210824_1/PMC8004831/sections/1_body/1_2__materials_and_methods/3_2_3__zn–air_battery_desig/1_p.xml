<p>Preparation of air electrode: the carbon slurry for the active layer of the air electrode was prepared based on a mixture of 10 wt% acetylene black, 40 wt% KMnO
 <sub>4</sub>, 10 wt% Vulcan XC-72R, 40 wt% Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>, and an appropriate amount of PVDF dissolved in ethyl alcohol. The mixture was then coated on nickel foam under a pressure of 80 kg/cm. The thickness of the air electrode was maintained within a range of 0.6 to 0.8 mm.
