 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-11-00224-f001">Figure 1</xref> schematically illustrates the preparation process of the RDC/PAAK/KOH composite films. Three steps were implemented in the preparation of the membranes: (i) The DC was treated with urea/LiOH solution and freezing-thawing to obtain an aqueous solution. The aqueous solution was then poured into a PTFE dish and evaporated at ambient temperature. Finally, a membrane, named RDC, was coagulated by ethyl alcohol for later use; (ii) The RDC membrane was immersed into an aqueous solution consisting of 10 mL AA, 8 g KOH, 0.15 g MBA, and 10 mL ultrapure water for 12 h. Then, 1.5 wt% K
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>8</sub> solution was sprinkled on the surface of the membrane as an initiator. Finally, the membrane was placed in an oven for polymerization at 60 Â°C for 2 h to acquire an RDC/PAAK membrane; and (iii) The RDC/PAAK membrane was soaked in KOH solution with a concentration of 8 M for 3 h, and then kept in a humidity controlled oven to maintain equilibrium. The resultant membrane is named RDC/PAAK/KOH (8 M)-3 h. Similarly, the RDC/PAAK membranes soaked in various concentrations of KOH at different times are named RDC/PAAK/KOH (x M)-x h.
