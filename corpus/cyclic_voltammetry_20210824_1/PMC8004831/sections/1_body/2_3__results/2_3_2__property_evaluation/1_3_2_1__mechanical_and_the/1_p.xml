<p>Mechanical properties also played an important role in the application of alkaline polymer electrolyte membranes. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-11-00224-f006">Figure 6</xref>A demonstrates the mechanical properties of the prepared alkaline polymer electrolyte membranes. After the introduction of PAAK for RDC/KOH (8 M)-3 h alkaline electrolyte membrane, both the tensile strength and elongation at break improved remarkably. Specific values of the tensile strength, elongation at break, and Youngâ€™s modulus are displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-11-00224-f006">Figure 6</xref>C. When the alkaline polymer membranes were pressed by battery clamps (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-11-00224-f006">Figure 6</xref>B(d)). Clearly, the introduction of the PAAK significantly enhanced the mechanical properties of the RDC-based electrolyte membrane. As the homogenous morphology observed in the inner layer of the RDC/PAAK/KOH (8 M)-3 h membrane (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-11-00224-f003">Figure 3</xref>d), PAAK dispersed and penetrated into the RDC matrix and combined with the RDC network to form a coherent whole composite. This composite possessed higher mechanical strength in comparison with the RDC/KOH network without PAAK. On the other hand, the RDC network was also beneficial for the PAAK in terms of alkali-resistance. As 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-11-00224-f006">Figure 6</xref>A shown, after undergoing a soak by 8 M KOH solution for 3 h, the sandwich membrane with PAAK as the outer layers still demonstrated a good mechanical strength (0.455 MPa) and high elongation at break (85%).
