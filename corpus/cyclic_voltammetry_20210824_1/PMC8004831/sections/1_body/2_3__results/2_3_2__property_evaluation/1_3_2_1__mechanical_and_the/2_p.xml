<p>TGA curves demonstrated distinct weight-loss behaviors between the RDC/KOH (8 M)-3 h and the RDC/PAAK/KOH (8 M)-3 h samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-11-00224-f007">Figure 7</xref>). Combined with the DTGA curves, three weight-loss stages can be recognized on the curve of the RDC/PAAK/KOH (8 M)-3 h, while two weight-loss stages were recognized for the RDC/KOH (8 M)-3 h. The first stage ranging from 50 to 200 째C for both samples is attributed to the water loss. It can be found that compared to the RDC/KOH (8 M)-3 h, RDC/PAAK/KOH (8 M)-3 h showed a faster water loss behavior, indicating the water adsorption strength in the RDC/PAAK/KOH (8 M)-3 h membrane was weaker than that in the RDC/KOH (8 M)-3 h membrane. Two similar weight-loss peaks at around 250 째C on the DTGA curves were observed for these two samples, and the peaks were attributed to the thermal degradation of RDC. A distinct weight-loss peak at 450 째C can be recognized on the DTG curve for RDC/PAAK/KOH (8 M)-3 h. This peak can be attributed to the thermal degradation of PAA. Above 500 째C, no obvious weight-loss was observed, and the remained component was attributed to the residual KOH. It can be found that the remained KOH content is 32% for RDC/PAAK/KOH (8 M)-3 h which is higher than the remained KOH content of 28% in the RDC/KOH (8 M)-3 h sample. The higher KOH content in the RDC/PAAK/KOH (8 M)-3 h system indicated higher KOH retention capacity and possible better ionic conductivity for the alkali polymer electrolyte.
