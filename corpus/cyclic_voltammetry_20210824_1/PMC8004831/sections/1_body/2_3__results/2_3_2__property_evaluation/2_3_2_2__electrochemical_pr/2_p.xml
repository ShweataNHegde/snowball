 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-11-00224-f008">Figure 8</xref>C exhibited the ionic conductivities for all the alkaline polymer electrolyte membranes. It can be found the ionic conductivity increased first and then decreased with the increase of the KOH solution concentration. The same tendency was observed for the ionic conductivity when the soaking time increased. The highest ionic conductivity was 0.25 S cm
 <sup>âˆ’1</sup> which was obtained when an 8 M KOH solution and 3 h soaking time were applied in the preparation of the electrolyte membrane.
