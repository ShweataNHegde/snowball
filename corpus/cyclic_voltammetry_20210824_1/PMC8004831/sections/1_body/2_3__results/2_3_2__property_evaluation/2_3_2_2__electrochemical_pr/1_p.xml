<p>All the alkaline polymer electrolyte membranes were measured by AC impedance at ambient temperature. Based on the AC impedance spectra (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-11-00224-f008">Figure 8</xref>A,B), the bulk resistance Rb of the alkaline polymer electrolyte membranes can be obtained. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-11-00224-f008">Figure 8</xref>A showed that the Rb was in the order of 0.4–2.2 Ω for alkaline polymer electrolyte membranes which were soaked by KOH solution with various alkaline concentrations. In contrast, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-11-00224-f008">Figure 8</xref>B showed the Rb was in the range of 0.4–0.7 Ω upon undergoing different immersing time. The relationship between ionic conductivity σ and the impedance Rb is characterized via Equation (1).
