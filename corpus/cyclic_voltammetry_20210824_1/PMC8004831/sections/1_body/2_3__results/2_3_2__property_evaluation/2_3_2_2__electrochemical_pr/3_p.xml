<p>In addition to high ionic conductivity, the wide electrochemical stability window was also an important factor for the alkaline polymer electrolyte membrane in the application of Zn–Air batteries. The electrochemical stability window was defined as a potential platform area where no induced current occurs with the variation of the voltage. The cyclic voltammetry curves for the RDC/PAAK/KOH alkaline polymer electrolytes with different KOH concentrations and soaking times are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-11-00224-f009">Figure 9</xref>. It can be found an electrochemical stability window of about 2.3 V was obtained for the RDC/PAAK/KOH electrolytes. Though the width of the stability window barely reduced with the increase of the KOH concentration and the soaking time, a value of about 2 V was still available for the alkaline electrolytes. Clearly, the good alkali resistance was attributed to the RDC network laminated in the inner layer of the sandwiched electrolyte. This RDC network acted as a role of the skeleton structure, avoiding the collapse of the PAAK outer layers and supporting the entire sandwiched membrane even in a high-concentration alkali environment. Simultaneously, the PAAK outer layers, together with the PAAK phase, dispersed in the inner layer were responsible for the ion transmission. These results indicate that the sandwiched RDC/PAAK/KOH electrolytes possess a relatively stable voltage and a high ionic conductivity simultaneously, showing promising potential in the application of Zn–Air batteries.
