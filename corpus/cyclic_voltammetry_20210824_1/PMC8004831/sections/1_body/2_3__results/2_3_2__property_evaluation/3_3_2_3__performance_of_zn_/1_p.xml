<p>The performance of RDC/PAAK/KOH (8 M)-3 h electrolyte membrane in the application of Zn–air batteries was conducted via discharge experiment. Here, the discharge curves of Zn–air batteries with different current densities ranging from 0.26 mAcm
 <sup>−2</sup> to 5.11 mAcm
 <sup>−2</sup> were measured by LAND autocycler (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-11-00224-f010">Figure 10</xref>A). A voltage platform lasting 500 min can be recognized when the current density is 0.26 mAcm
 <sup>−2</sup>. With the increase of the current density, the width of the voltage platform kept decreasing. No voltage platform can be found in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-11-00224-f010">Figure 10</xref>A when the current density is higher than 5 mAcm
 <sup>−2</sup>. This phenomenon implies the rapid consumption of Zn electrodes with the increase of the current density. In addition, it can be speculated from the discharge curves that a relatively good diffusion of OH
 <sup>−1</sup> in the alkaline electrolyte membrane can be achieved when the current density is no higher than 0.26 mAcm
 <sup>−2</sup>. As for a current density higher than 5 mAcm
 <sup>−2</sup>, the RDC/PAAK/KOH-based alkali electrolyte would cause an insufficient OH
 <sup>−1</sup> transmission and lead to a rapid voltage decline. The variation of the power density, capacity density, and energy density with the current density are displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-11-00224-f010">Figure 10</xref>B,C. It can be seen that the power density and energy density obtained the maximum values when the current density reached 2.04 mAcm
 <sup>−2</sup>, while the maximum capacity density appeared when the current density reached 1.02 mAcm
 <sup>−2</sup>. The luminescence experiment was conducted as 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-11-00224-f010">Figure 10</xref>D shown, in which a LED bubble was connected with the prepared Zn–Air battery and the glowing time lasted about 15 h. Based on the RDC/PAAK/KOH system, the alkali polymer electrolyte membranes demonstrate a promising potential in the application of Zn–Air battery. On the other hand, higher current density endurance and powder density are necessary to improve the battery performance, and further efforts are required in future.
