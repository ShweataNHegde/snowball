<p>Structural features of the membranes were further revealed via Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Distinct IR features between samples are displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-11-00224-f005">Figure 5</xref>. Compared to RDC/KOH (8 M)-3 h, a sharp absorption peak at 1700 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> was observed for RDC/PAAK/KOH (8 M)-3 h. This signal was attributed to the carboxyl groups of the acrylic acid, indicating the successful introduction of AA into the polymer matrix. This carboxyl group is beneficial for OH
 <sup>−1</sup> absorption, and was further confirmed by the broad absorption band at around 3300 cm. This band was attributed to the –OH vibration which is a combination of the –OH groups of KOH and cellulose. Compared to RDC/KOH (8 M)-3 h, it is noteworthy that the band was much stronger for RDC/PAAK/KOH (8 M)-3 h, indicating that more KOH had been absorbed by the polymer matrix. Combined with the homogenous dispersion of KOH in the membrane matrix as observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-11-00224-f003">Figure 3</xref>d, it can be speculated that the introduction of PAA within the polymer matrix and its interaction with the KOH enhance the KOH retention capacity and facilitate the ionic conductivity for the electrolyte membrane.
