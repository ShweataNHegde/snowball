<p>SEM measurements were conducted to reveal the morphologies of RDC/KOH polymer electrolyte membranes. The cross-sections of the RDC/KOH (8 M)-3 h and RDC/PAAK/KOH (8 M)-3 h membranes are displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-11-00224-f003">Figure 3</xref>a,b, respectively. Compared to the RDC/KOH (8 M)-3 h membrane, a sandwich structure with two outer layers of about 0.1 mm thickness can be discerned on the cross-section of the RDC/PAAK/KOH (8 M)-3 h membrane. The formation of this sandwich structure can be attributed to the polymerization of acrylic potassium on the surface of the RDC, by which a surface layer, consisting of the polymerized acrylic potassium (PAAK), was achieved. Moreover, it is noteworthy that compared to the RDC/KOH (8 M)-3 h membrane, after the introduction of AA, no remarkable KOH aggregates were found in the inner layer of the RDC/PAAK/KOH (8 M)-3 h membrane (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-11-00224-f003">Figure 3</xref>c,d). This phenomenon can be attributed to the PAA components formed via the polymerization of AA monomers in the RDC membrane matrix by which the carboxylic groups on the PAA chains would facilitate the interaction with KOH and improve the homogenous dispersion of KOH in the polymer matrix. It can be speculated that the improved dispersion of KOH in the inner layer of the electrolyte membrane would benefit the ionic conductivity. Moreover, PAAK outer layers would play an important role as the continuous phase for the ionic conduction. A remarkable performance improvement can be imagined for the electrolyte membrane with sandwich structure compared to the one-layer counterpart.
