<p>In order to explore the crystallinity of the alkaline polymer electrolyte membranes, WAXD was used in the experiment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-11-00224-f004">Figure 4</xref>). For the RDC sample, three distinct peaks at 2θ = 12, 20°and 22° were recognized, indicating the typical absorption signals of cellulose II crystal planes (101), (10

This result indicated that PAAK reduced the crystallinity of the RDC. Moreover, a broad peak was found at around 2θ = 30° for the RDC/PAAK/KOH (8 M)-3 h. This peak can be attributed to the KOH component as evidenced by the typical crystal signals at 2θ ranging from 30°to 35° for the neat KOH. Compared to the sharp peaks of the neat KOH, the broad peak indicates the low crystallinity degree and imperfect crystal of KOH in the RDC/PAAK/KOH (8 M)-3 h membrane. This result is consistent with the morphologies observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="membranes-11-00224-f003">Figure 3</xref> in which no obvious KOH aggregate was observed due to the homogenous dispersion of KOH in the membrane matrix.
