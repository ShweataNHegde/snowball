<p>In our previous work, we also reported that modified microcrystalline cellulose composited with PVA/PEO can increase alkali resistance, ionic conductivity, and mechanical properties simultaneously [

However, our previous study showed that the addition of more MCC would result in the creation of an MCC aggregate in the electrolyte membrane which impaired the battery performance and caused a decrease in the ionic conductivity.
