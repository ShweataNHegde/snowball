<p>Considering the issue mentioned above, a polymer electrolyte membrane with a sandwich structure was developed in this paper. Instead of the commonly used MCC, regenerated degreasing cotton (RDC) was selected. Successful polymerization of the acrylic acid on the surface of the RDC network (soaked by KOH solution) was achieved. The resultant poly-acrylic potassium (PAAK) served as the outer layers, and the RDC network acted as the inner layer, yielding an alkali polymer electrolyte membrane with a sandwich structure. This design avoids the issue of MCC aggregation by directly using the RDC network as the inner layer to support the entire membrane in the alkali environment. On the other hand, the PAAK outer layers can be used as an effective conducting phase for ion transmission. The structure and performance of this polymer electrolyte membrane were studied in this paper to show the possibility of its use in Znâ€“Air batteries.</p>
