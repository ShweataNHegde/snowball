<p>Cellulose has recently been considered an effective filler in electrochemical polymer matrices. Qing et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-membranes-11-00224" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] added 3 wt% cellulose nanofibrils into a poly (acrylic acid) (PAA) matrix and observed enhanced ionic conductivity and mechanical performance when compared with pristine PAA. Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-membranes-11-00224" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] prepared a laminated, cross-linked nanocellulose/graphene oxide (GO) membrane functionalized with quaternary ammonium (QA) for a flexible rechargeable Znâ€“Air battery. The QA-functionalized nanocellulose/GO (QAFCGO) membrane showed superior OH-conductivity at room temperature.
