<p>Because of their high specific capacity, high energy density, stable discharge voltage, and no pollution, Zn–Air batteries have recently received enormous attention as promising green energy devices, especially as a reliable power source for portable electronics [

Zn–Air batteries generally comprise Zn metal anodes, metal oxide cathodes, a potassium hydroxide (KOH)-based alkaline electrolyte solution, and separator membranes. However, there is a risk of liquid leaking and corrosivity severely restricting the practical application of such batteries. Thus, alkaline polymer electrolyte membranes with nontoxic, low leakage, and abundant raw materials with high electrical conductivity were developed [
