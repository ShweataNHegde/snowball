<p>However, as the cathode for rechargeable LIBs, SVOs suffer from considerable capacity loss and low Coulombic efficiency (CE) during the repeated charge-discharge process. This intrinsic hurdle of SVOs is mainly caused by two reasons: (1) the collapse of its layered structures and the amorphization of the electrode surface [
