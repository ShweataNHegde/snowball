<p>Currently, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are known as the most suitable energy storage devices for application in vehicle-carried electronic devices and portable electronics due to their high energy density, excellent sustainability, high voltage, and long lifespan [

 <xref rid="B2-nanomaterials-11-00569" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Since the cathode plays a significant role in current LIBs, its properties significantly affect the electrochemical performance of the whole system [
