<p>In this work, a facile hydrothermal method was first presented to synthesis β-AgVO
 <sub>3</sub> nanowires. Then, thin Al
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> ALD coatings of about 1 to 10 nm were explored as stable artificial cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI) on the SVO electrodes. The galvanostatic charge-discharge test revealed that the SVO electrodes with Al
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> coatings exhibited higher specific capacities and better cycling stability than the pristine SVO. The CE of SVO electrodes was also significantly improved by using ALD Al
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> coatings. The underlying mechanism was explored by cyclic voltammetry (CV), cyclic voltammetry (EIS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the main reason for the improved electrochemical performance of β-AgVO
 <sub>3</sub> was attributed to the artificial CEI with improved ion transport properties. The Al
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> coatings could effectively inhibit the side reaction between the electrode and electrolyte by suppressing the collapse of its layered structure and alleviate vanadium dissolution into the electrolyte.
