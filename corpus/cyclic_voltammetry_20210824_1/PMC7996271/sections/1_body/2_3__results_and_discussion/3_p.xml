<p>To further evaluate the electrochemical reversibility, the CV curves of all the samples in the first two cycles are compared in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00569-f003">Figure 3</xref>. It can be observed in the first cycle, all the SVO samples show three strong cathodic peaks at around 3.06, 2.38, and 1.86 V, and three anode peaks at about 3.43, 2.66, and 2.12 V, corresponding to the multistep electrochemical lithium-ion intercalation-deintercalation processes [
 <xref rid="B33-nanomaterials-11-00569" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. According to the previous reports [

 <xref rid="B34-nanomaterials-11-00569" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], the cathodic peak at 3.06 V is assigned to the reduction of Ag

 <sup>0</sup>. The peak at 2.38 V corresponds to the reduction of V
 <sup>5+</sup> to V
 <sup>4+</sup> and the partial reduction of V
 <sup>4+</sup> to V
 <sup>3+</sup>. The peak at 1.86 V is attributed to the further reduction of V
 <sup>4+</sup> to V
 <sup>3+</sup> and Ag
 <sup>+</sup> to Ag
 <sup>0</sup>. However, SVO-100 shows a new pair of a cathodic peak at 2.72 V and an anode peak at 3.06 V, similar to the Ag
