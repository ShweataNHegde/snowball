<p>The potential differences between each redox process vary with the increase of Al
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> coating layers on the electrodes, resulting in different voltage hysteresis (Î”
 <italic>V</italic>) between the anodic and cathodic peaks. The exact values are summarized in 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-11-00569-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. It can be found that SVO electrodes coated with Al
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> show higher voltage hysteresis than SVO-0 in each CV cycle. With increasing ALD cycles, the SVO cathodes exhibit higher average voltage hysteresis. It might stem from the hindrance of the Li
 <sup>+</sup> transport across the interface between SVO and the electrolyte by the Al
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> coating in the first cycle. In the second and third cycles, the average voltage hysteresis becomes smaller, indicating the decreased polarization and increased electrochemical kinetics benefiting from CEI formation. It can be found that the thick Al
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> coating on SVO-100 may cause the phase transformation that occurred upon cycling, which shows decreased polarization during the following electrochemical process.
