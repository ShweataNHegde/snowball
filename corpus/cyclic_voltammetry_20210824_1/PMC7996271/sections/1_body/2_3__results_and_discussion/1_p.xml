<p>The crystal structure of the as-prepared sample is determined by XRD, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00569-f001">Figure 1</xref>a. All the characteristic peaks agree with monoclinic β-AgVO
 <sub>3</sub> (JCPDS card No. 86-1154). It should be noted that the strongest diffraction peak for β-AgVO
 <sub>3</sub> is (−601), different from (311) for standard monoclinic β-AgVO
 <sub>3</sub>, suggesting anisotropic growth of the β-AgVO
 <sub>3</sub> nanowires with preferred orientation [
 <xref rid="B30-nanomaterials-11-00569" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. There is no other peak detected in the XRD analysis, indicating the high purity of the sample. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00569-f001">Figure 1</xref>b shows the SEM morphology of the as-obtained β-AgVO
 <sub>3</sub> nanowires. It can be seen that all the synthesized β-AgVO
 <sub>3</sub> is composed of nanowires with lengths from 2 to 20 μm. Some of the nanowires adhere to each other into bundles. The morphology and microstructure of the β-AgVO
 <sub>3</sub> are further characterized by TEM, and the results are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00569-f001">Figure 1</xref>c. It can be seen that the width of a single nanowire is about 40–100 nm. The HRTEM image (inset in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00569-f001">Figure 1</xref>c) reveals that the interplanar distance is 0.20 nm for both nanowire and protuberant nanoparticle and matches with the d
 <sub>(−204)</sub> of monoclinic β-AgVO
 <sub>3</sub>. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of an individual nanowire (inset in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00569-f001">Figure 1</xref>c) shows the concentric diffraction rings of the (–202), (–112), and (110) planes. The above results suggest the successful synthesis of monoclinic β-AgVO
 <sub>3</sub> nanowires by the facile hydrothermal method. The SEM image of the Al
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> coating fabricated by ALD on the β-AgVO
 <sub>3</sub> electrode is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00569-f001">Figure 1</xref>d. The thickness of the Al
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> coating on the β-AgVO
 <sub>3</sub> electrode was controlled by the number of ALD cycles. The deposition rate is about 1 Å per cycle [
 <xref rid="B24-nanomaterials-11-00569" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The Al
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> coating deposited with 100 ALD cycles is approximately 10 nm. The composition is further confirmed by elemental mapping of the Al
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>-coated β-AgVO
 <sub>3</sub> electrode (
