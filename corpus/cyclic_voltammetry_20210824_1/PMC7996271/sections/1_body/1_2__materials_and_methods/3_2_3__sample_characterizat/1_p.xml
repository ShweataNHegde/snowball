<p>The morphology and crystalline structure of the above all samples were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) with Rigaku D/max rA X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The 2
 <italic>θ</italic> scan range was from 10° to 80° at a scan rate of 7° per minute. The field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken on an FEI Sirion-200 SEM (FEI Company, Houston, TX, USA). The energy dispersive X-ray spectra (EDS) were recorded by JEOL-7001F SEM/EDS microscope (Jeol Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were performed with a Hitachi Model H-800 instrument (Hitachi, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were carried out on a JEOL-2010 TEM (Jeol Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).
