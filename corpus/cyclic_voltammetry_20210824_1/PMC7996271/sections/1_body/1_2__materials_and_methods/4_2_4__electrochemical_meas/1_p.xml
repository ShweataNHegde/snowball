<p>The electrochemical characterization was carried out in CR2032 coin-type half cells, assembled in an argon-filled glovebox. The AgVO
 <sub>3</sub> electrodes with and without Al
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> coating ALD were used as the cathode, lithium metal as the anode, and 1 M LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> in volume ratio of 1:1:1 ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate/ethylene methyl carbonate as the electrolyte. Galvanostatic discharge-charge cycling tests were carried out at room temperature using the LANDCT2001A (Wuhan Jinnuo, China). The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted using the Zahner Zennium E electrochemical workstation (Zahner Scientific Instruments, Kronach, Germany) over the frequency range of 0.01 Hzâ€“100,000 Hz with an amplitude of 5 mV.
