<p>All chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co.,Ltd. Shanghai, China). First, NH
 <sub>4</sub>VO
 <sub>3</sub> with an amount of 0.117 g (1 mmol) was dissolved into 30 mL of deionized water at 80 °C, and AgNO
 <sub>3</sub> with the same equal molar was dissolved in 10 mL of deionized water. Then the NH
 <sub>4</sub>VO
 <sub>3</sub> solution was added slowly to the AgNO
 <sub>3</sub> solution under magnetic stirring, with orange precipitate observed. After the solution was stirred for 15 min, the mixture was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, which was sealed and maintained at 200 °C for 18 h before naturally cooling to room temperature (RT) after the reaction. The precipitate was collected and washed three times with distilled water and absolute ethanol, respectively. Finally, the collected powders were dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 6 h.
