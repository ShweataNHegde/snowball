<p>The SVO electrodes were fabricated by mixing the as-prepared SVO nanowires, acetylene black, and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder in a weight ratio of 75:15:10 in N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) solvent. The prepared SVO electrode was employed as the substrates for the deposition of Al
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> thin film. The deposition of Al
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> was performed at 150 °C by sequentially introducing trimethylaluminum (TMA) and H
 <sub>2</sub>O as precursors into a commercial ALD reactor (GEMStar™ XT Atomic Layer Deposition System). Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 20 sccm, and the ALD reactor was sustained at a base pressure of typically 200 millitorrs. The ALD procedure was set as follows: (1) a 21 mSec supply of TMA; (2) a 5 s extended exposure of TMA to SVO electrode; (3) a 20 s purge of oversupplied TMA and any byproducts; (4) a 21 mSec supply of H
 <sub>2</sub>O vapor; (5) a 5 s extended exposure of H
 <sub>2</sub>O to SVO; (6) a 20 s purge of oversupplied H
 <sub>2</sub>O and any by-products. The thickness of Al
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> coating on SVO was controlled by varying ALD cycle number. The deposition rate was about 1 Å per cycle. The Al
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> coating was conducted with various ALD cycles of 0, 10, 50, and 100 on SVO, referred to as SVO-0, SVO-10, SVO-50, SVO-100, respectively, from now on.
