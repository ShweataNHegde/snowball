<p>In summary, we have successfully prepared β-AgVO
 <sub>3</sub> nanowires by a facile hydrothermal method. Al
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> coating was conducted directly on the prepared β-AgVO
 <sub>3</sub> cathode by using different ALD cycles to construct artificial CEI and improve the electrochemical performance for LIBs. The optimal Al
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> coating was 10 nm (100 ALD cycles). The Al
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> coating significantly promoted the durability and CE in the galvanostatic charge–discharge test by suppressing the collapse of its layered structures and the dissolution of vanadium into the electrolyte. The phase transformation during the redox reaction affected by the thickness of Al
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> coatings is also revealed by the CV test. Simultaneously, the CEI resistance and the charge transfer resistance were greatly reduced, resulting in decreased polarization and increased electrochemical kinetics. The protective Al
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> ALD coating is a promising method to protect SVO material and other vanadium-based electrode materials for the stable operation of rechargeable LIBs to extend the service life for implantable medical devices.
