<p>The response of QUI 
 <bold>6</bold> in buffered solutions is depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02227-f007">Figure 7</xref>. Below pH = 9, a second oxidation peak was visible and it increased in size as the pH decreased. It corresponds to the oxidation of dihydroquinoxaline (
 <bold>7</bold>) to yield the hydroxyl derivative 
 <bold>8a</bold>, which then may tautomerize to 
 <bold>9a</bold> (
 <bold>8a</bold> to 
 <bold>9a</bold>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02227-f002">Figure 2</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-02227" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The degradation process to form 
 <bold>8a</bold> was less pronounced in unbuffered solutions, likely due to the local increase of the pH (near the electrode surface) caused by the reduction of QUI 
 <bold>6</bold>. The appearance of multiple peaks at pH = 1.7 was likely due to a combination of different reasons. The oxidation and reduction peaks split into two separate one-electron peaks at low pH [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-26-02227" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Additionally, QUI 
 <bold>6</bold> may undergo irreversible electrochemically driven degradation reactions at positive potentials (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02227-f002">Figure 2</xref>), likely explaining the most positive observed small oxidation peak.
