<p>In the absence of buffer, the proton coupled reduction process of QUI 
 <bold>6</bold> to 
 <bold>7</bold> causes an increase in the pH close to the electrode surface due to the removal of protons from the solution. The electrochemical behavior of QUI 
 <bold>6</bold> was also examined in buffered solutions where the pH was practically constant [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-26-02227" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Britton–Robinson universal buffer solution was used due to the wide range of pH available (2–12), alongside the ease of tuning the pH to the desired value by adding KOH without changing the substrate.
