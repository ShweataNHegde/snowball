<p>The obtained aggregation constants (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-02227">Supporting Info., Figures S4â€“S6</xref>) using the two different models were almost identical, indicating that the dominating aggregate formed was a dimer, and that any higher aggregates were only present at very low concentration. The bulky and charged side groups reduced dimerization likely due to both steric hindrance effects and coulombic repulsion.
