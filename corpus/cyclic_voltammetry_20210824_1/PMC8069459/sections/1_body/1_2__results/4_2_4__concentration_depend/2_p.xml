<p>Concentration dependent peak shifts observed in NMR spectra were monitored in order to gain more information regarding the aggregation constant and the structure (dimers, trimers, etc.) of the possible aggregates. 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectra at different concentration of DSMeQUI 
 <bold>20</bold> (from 1 M to 25 mM in the 0.1 M KOH/0.9 M KCl) were recorded. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02227-f010">Figure 10</xref>a, with increasing concentrations of the analyte, there was a shift of the aromatic signals toward lower fields and of the CH
 <sub>2</sub> connected to the sulfonates group to higher fields. This is indicative of a fast equilibrium between the monomer and the aggregate structure(s) formed by a Ï€-stacking interaction.
