<p>The introduction of functional group alters the physicochemical and electrochemical properties of pristine pyrazine [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-02227" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The type and number of substituents play major roles in the response [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-02227" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Herein, methyl and carboxylic acid groups were chosen as electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups, respectively. The effect of the nature and the number of substituents on the pyrazine ring was studied by cyclic voltammetry. The structures of six of the investigated pyrazines are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02227-f003">Figure 3</xref>. It consists of pristine pyrazine (
 <bold>1</bold>) and mono- (
 <bold>10</bold>,
 <bold>13</bold>), di- (
 <bold>11</bold>,
 <bold>14</bold>), and tetra-substituted (
 <bold>12</bold>,
 <bold>15</bold>) pyrazines with methyl and carboxylic acid substituents.
