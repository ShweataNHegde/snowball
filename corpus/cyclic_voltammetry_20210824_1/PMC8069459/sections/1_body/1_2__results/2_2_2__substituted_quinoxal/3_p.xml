<p>Closer inspection of the observed average peak potentials (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02227-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) shows that the influence of a functional group on the redox potential depends on its relative position to the quinoxaline core. For example, the measured average peak potential of 2-methyl quinoxaline 
 <bold>16</bold> was 40 mV more negative than the one of 5-methyl quinoxaline 
 <bold>17</bold>.
