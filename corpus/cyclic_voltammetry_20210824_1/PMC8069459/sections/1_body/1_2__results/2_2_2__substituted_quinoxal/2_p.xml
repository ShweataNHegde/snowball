 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02227-f005">Figure 5</xref> illustrates the resulting voltammograms of solutions of 5 mM analyte dissolved in 0.1 M KOH/0.9 M KCl. The kinetics and the redox potential were affected both by the type and the position (relative to the active ring) of the functional groups. Molecules 
 <bold>20</bold> and 
 <bold>18</bold> have charged functional groups attached to the pyrazine ring and displayed the slowest electrochemical kinetics. When similar groups (e.g., â€“COOH) were attached further away from the pyrazine ring, it had a significantly smaller effect on the kinetics (
 <bold>19</bold>).
