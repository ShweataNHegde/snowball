<p>The current work focused on the electrochemical behavior of substituted pyrazines and quinoxalines under aqueous buffered and unbuffered solutions. Pyrazine 1,2-methylpyrazine 
 <bold>10</bold>, 2,5-dimethylpyrazine 
 <bold>11</bold>, 2,3,5,6-tetramethylpyrazine 
 <bold>12</bold>, pyrazine-2-carboxylic acid 
 <bold>13</bold>, pyrazine-2,5-dicarboxylic acid dihydrate 
 <bold>14</bold>, QUI 
 <bold>6</bold>, quinoxaline-6-carboxylic acid 
 <bold>19</bold>, 2-methylquinoxaline 
 <bold>16</bold>, 5-methylquinoxaline 
 <bold>17</bold>, and 3 hydroxyquinoxaline-2-carboxylic acid 
 <bold>18</bold> were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Søborg, Denmark) and used without any further purification, while pyrazine-2,3,5,6-tetracarboxylic 
 <bold>15</bold> acid was synthesized in-house. Sodium quinoxaline-2,3-bismethylsulfonate (DSMeQUI) was synthesized in house by an SN2 type reaction on 2,3 bis(bromomethyl)quinoxaline. The unbuffered solutions were based on KCl, KOH, and 37% HCl as electrolytes, while for the buffered solutions the Britton–Robinson universal buffer was used and adjusted to the desired pH by the addition of solid KOH.
