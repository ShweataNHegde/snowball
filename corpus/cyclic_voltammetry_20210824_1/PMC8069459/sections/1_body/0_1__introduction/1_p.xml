<p>The rapid increase in installed capacity of intermittent renewable energy sources motivates research into sustainable and low cost stationary energy storage technologies. Redox flow batteries (RFBs) are particularly attractive for large-scale energy storage due to the decoupled power and energy inherent in such systems, and the resulting falling cost of energy storage with increasing discharge times. Aqueous organic flow batteries are particularly attractive for large-scale energy storage due to the use of a non-flammable electrolyte and the promise of environmentally-benign components. Mass production costs of the active materials and electrolyte lifetime are the primary barriers for widespread introduction of commercial aqueous organic flow batteries. It has been projected that large scale production of organic active materials for flow batteries can have low production costs [
