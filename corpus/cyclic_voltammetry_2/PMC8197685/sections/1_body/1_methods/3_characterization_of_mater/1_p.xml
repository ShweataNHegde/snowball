<p id="Par30">The crystal structure of the as-synthesized samples was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 Discover Bruker). X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) was performed to analyze the elemental composition of the samples using a K-Alpha 1063 analyzer. The morphology of the samples was studied using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-7100F, JEOL) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2100F). The specific surface area of the samples was calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method based on the N
 <sub>2</sub> adsorption–desorption isotherms obtained by using a V-Sorb 2800P. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out in air with a heating rate of 10 °C min
