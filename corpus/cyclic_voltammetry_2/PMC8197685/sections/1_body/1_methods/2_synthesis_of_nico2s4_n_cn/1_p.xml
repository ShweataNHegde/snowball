 <sub>2</sub>O and 0.037 g of Ni(Ac)
 <sub>2</sub>·4H
 <sub>2</sub>O were added, and the mixture was stirred on a water bath at 80 °C for 2 h. Next, 2 mL of NH

 <sub>2</sub>O and 0.078 g of thiourea were added to the solution, and the reaction mixture was stirred for 2 h. The reaction mixture was transferred to a 50-mL autoclave, followed by a hydrothermal reaction at 170 °C for 3 h. The product was cooled to room temperature and centrifuged with deionized water several times and freeze-dried. NiCo
