 <sub>2</sub>·4H
 <sub>2</sub>O and 0.037 g of Ni(Ac)
 <sub>2</sub>·4H
 <sub>2</sub>O were dissolved in 40 mL ethanol. The solution was stirred on a water bath at 80 °C for 2 h and at room temperature for another 2 h. Then, 0.078 g of thiourea was added to the mixture, which was further continuously stirred for 20 h before transferring the reaction mixture to a 100 mL autoclave. The hydrothermal reaction was carried out at 170 °C for 3 h. After cooling to room temperature, the product was washed several times with deionized water and freeze-dried under reduced pressure.
