<p id="Par36">The electrochemical characteristics of NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>/N-CNT for Li storage were evaluated by CV and charge–discharge cycling, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> at a potential range of 0.01–3.00 V (vs. Li
 <sup>+</sup>/Li). The cathodic process consisted of three reduction peaks (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a) situated at 1.71 V, 1.33 V, and 0.70 V. The strongest peak is positioned at 1.33 V, and two weaker peaks correspond to the reduction of NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub> to Ni and Co. In comparison, the peaks at 1.71 V and 0.70 V correspond to the formation of Li
 <sub>2</sub>S and the SEI film, respectively. In the anodic process, the oxidation peaks at 1.33 V and 2.05 V can be attributed to the oxidation of metallic Co to CoS
 <sub>x</sub>. In addition, there is an intensive peak at 2.32 V resulting from the oxidation reactions of metallic Ni and Co to NiS
 <sub>x</sub> and CoS
 <sub>x</sub>, respectively. The shape of the curve, peak position, and the intensity of peaks are relatively stable in the following cycles, indicating that NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>/N-CNT has good stability and reversibility.
