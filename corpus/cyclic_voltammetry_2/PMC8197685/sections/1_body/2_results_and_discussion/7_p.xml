<p id="Par38">To further study the electrochemical performance of NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>/N-CNT, the rate capability was evaluated at current densities from 0.1 to 5 A g
 <sup>–1</sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c). The results indicate that the capacity of NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>/N-CNT decreased with the increase in current density. When the current density was returned to 0.1 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>, the capacity of NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>/N-CNT returned to a value of 796.1 mAh g
 <sup>–1</sup>, exhibiting about 84% capacity retention and demonstrating that NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>/N-CNT exhibits an excellent rate performance. The cycling performance data of NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>/N-CNT, NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>/CNT, and NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub> for 100 cycles at 0.1 A g
 <sup>–1</sup> are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d. For the initial 50 cycles, the anode undergoes a slight capacity fading. Then, NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>/N-CNT anode stabilized its capacity for the rest of the cycles and demonstrated a value of 623.0 mAh g
 <sup>–1</sup> after 100 cycles. These results show that compared with the NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>/CNT and NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub> electrodes, the NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>/N-CNT electrode exhibited a remarkably higher discharge specific capacity and better cycle stability. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>e shows the EIS data. The high-frequency semicircles in the Nyquist plots correspond to the charge transfer resistance (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>ct</sub>) of the electrodes. The NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>/N-CNT electrode clearly exhibits the lowest 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>ct</sub> values, suggesting a remarkably enhanced charge/mass transfer kinetics. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>f shows the cycling performance of NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>/N-CNT electrode at 0.5 A g
 <sup>−1</sup> over 500 cycles. The NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>/N-CNT electrode delivers an initial specific discharge capacity of 750.2 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> and maintains a reversible capacity of 539.3 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> after 500 cycles, further confirming an excellent cycling and rate capability of this high capacity anode for lithium batteries.
