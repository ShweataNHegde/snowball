 <xref rid="Sch1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the preparation route of NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>/N-CNT composite. Initially, the surface of CNT was pretreated with a solution of Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> and Co
 <sup>2+</sup>. Then, the N atoms were doped into the CNTs via a hydrothermal reaction at 170 °C, while NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub> was grown in situ on the surface of CNTs. The crystal structures of NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>, NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>/CNT, and NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>/N-CNT composites were characterized by XRD (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). The characteristic diffraction peaks of NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub> (JCPDS 20-0728) were observed in all the three samples. Moreover, the peaks in NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>/N-CNT were more pronounced and sharper than those in NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>/CNT [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. It is believed that N-CNT can be used as active nucleation sites to promote the uniform and dense growth of NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b shows the BET results for the NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>/N-CNT nanocomposites. The specific surface area of NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>/N-CNT nanocomposites is 62.67 m
 <sup>2</sup> g
 <sup>−1</sup>. As shown in the TGA analysis data (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c), the NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>/N-CNT nanocomposite exhibited a weight loss at a temperature range of 400–600 °C, which was caused by the combustion of CNTs. Therefore, the content of NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub> in the NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>/N-CNT composite was determined as ~ 30 wt%.
