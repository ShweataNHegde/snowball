 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b shows the charge–discharge curves of NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>/N-CNT at 0.1 A g
 <sup>–1</sup> for the 1st, 2nd, and 10th cycles. The first charge and discharge capacities of the NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>/N-CNT electrode reached 807.6 and 1412.1 mAh g
 <sup>–1</sup>, respectively, with the initial coulombic efficiency of 57.2%. The discharge capacities of the 2nd and 10th cycles are 970.7 mAh g
 <sup>–1</sup> and 891.1 mAh g
 <sup>–1</sup>, respectively. The reversibility of the charge/discharge process improved with the cycle number accompanied with an increased coulombic efficiency. The obtained CV profiles correspond to the charge/discharge curves of NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>/N-CNT.
