 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, b. The as-synthesized NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub> nanoparticles appear to be more tightly packed and agglomerated. On the other hand, through the introduction of CNT and N-CNT, the NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub> nanoparticles were uniformly distributed and deposited to form NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>/CNT composite (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, d) and NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>/N-CNT (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e, f), respectively. However, the density of NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub> nanoparticles on the N-CNT surface in NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>/N-CNT was significantly higher than that in the NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>/CNT composite. This confirms that the introduction of N atoms in CNTs promotes the denser growth of NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub> nanoparticles.
