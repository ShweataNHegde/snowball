<p id="Par34">The TEM images in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a show that the NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub> particles have an average diameter of ~ 5 nm and are uniformly distributed on the surface of N-CNTs. In the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>/N-CNT shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b, the nanoparticles of about 5 nm in diameter exhibit a clear lattice fringe of 0.35 nm, corresponding to the (220) plane of NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>. Besides, many crooked graphitic lattice fringes were observed around the nanoparticles. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) and lattice spacing profiles in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b further confirmed the incorporation of NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub> nanoparticles into the N-CNT structure.
