<p id="Par27">To overcome the issues of NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub> anodes related to the volume change and LPS dissolution, various approaches including nanostructuring and use of carbonaceous additives and carbon-based hosts have been developed with promising results. Nanostructuring and its combination with carbon/graphene networks can increase the electrode–electrolyte interface contact area and shorten the Li-ion pathways, leading to a higher specific capacity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Therefore, this study reports the in situ growth of NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub> nanoparticles onto carbon nanotubes (CNT) structure using a hydrothermal method. Furthermore, to increase the electroactivity of the electrode material, the nitrogen (N) heteroatoms were incorporated into the CNT matrix. Such a processing makes N-CNT more conducive, leading to the uniform growth of NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub> and thus improving the crystallinity of NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>/N-CNT anode. In this unique structure, CNT forms an elastic matrix that enhances the structural stability, improves the ionic conductivity of the composite, and mitigates the volume variation of NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub> particles. The NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>/N-CNT material maintains good capacity retention during cycling and significantly restrains the voltage fading. The NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>/N-CNT composite anode exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 1412.1 mAh g
 <sup>–1</sup> at 0.1 A g
 <sup>–1</sup>, and the discharge capacity remains at 623.0 mAh g
 <sup>–1</sup> after 100 cycles.
