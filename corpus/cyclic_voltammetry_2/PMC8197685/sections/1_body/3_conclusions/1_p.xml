<p id="Par39">In summary, a NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>/N-CNT composite was prepared using a one-pot facile hydrothermal synthesis route. By introducing the N atoms into the CNT structure, uniformly distributed NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub> nanoparticles with reduced particle sizes were obtained. The assembled cells with the NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub>/N-CNT anode demonstrated a high specific capacity of about 623.0 mAh g
 <sup>–1</sup> and excellent cycling stability at 0.1 A g
 <sup>–1</sup> after 100 cycles. Furthermore, this electrode exhibited an excellent cycling property at 0.5 A g
 <sup>−1</sup> over 500 cycles, confirming its ability to maintain its high performance at elevated current densities. Our study shows that this synthesis method is a feasible way to grow NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>4</sub> nanoparticles with uniform distribution on the surface of a CNT substrate as a high-performance anode for LIBs.
