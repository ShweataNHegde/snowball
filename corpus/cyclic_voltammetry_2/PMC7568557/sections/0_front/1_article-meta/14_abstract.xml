 <p id="Par2">Sodium sulfur batteries require efficient sulfur hosts that can capture soluble polysulfides and enable fast reduction kinetics. Here, authors report hollow catalytic bipyramid prism CoS
  <sub>2</sub>/C as efficient sulfur carriers, and investigate the reaction mechanism in the sodium sulfur battery.
