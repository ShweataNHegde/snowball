 <sub>2</sub>/C (BPCS) have been designed as an efficient sulfur host for Naâ€“S batteries. BPCS have a unique architecture with a hierarchical surface and wide internal spaces that provide sufficient room to accommodate sodium polysulfides (NaPSs) and can withstand volume expansion during sodiation and desodiation. This study provides a systematic method for further understanding of the reversible reaction mechanism during the charge/discharge process. In/ex situ experimental results elucidate the discharge mechanism and confirm the importance of polar and catalytic BPCS in accelerating the electrochemical reaction and enabling the direct conversion of short-chain polysulfides to long-chain polysulfides (instead of Na
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>5</sub>) without affecting the reactants or products, thereby reducing the one-step reaction process and accelerating the reaction kinetics. Furthermore, DFT calculations support the mechanism that polysulfide adsorption is superior for metal sulfides, selenides and tellurides with interwoven surfaces and chemical composition when compared to carbon hosts. This study shows that a polar and catalytic sulfur host with unique architecture can catalyze the polysulfides conversion reactions and suppress the shuttle effect by chemisorption, resulting in good electrochemical performance. While the focus of this study was on cobalt based catalytic sulfur hosts, the combined experimental and computational methodology used in this work is widely applicable to other transition metal dichalcogenide systems.
