 </sup>. Bulk phases of CoS
 <sub>2</sub> and CoTe
 <sub>2</sub> were modeled with the pyrite (
 <italic>Pa</italic>-3) and marcasite (
 <italic>Pnnm</italic>) structures, respectively, and will subsequently be referred to as p-CoS
 <sub>2</sub> and m-CoTe
 <sub>2</sub>. In this study, the CoSe
 <sub>2</sub> bipyramidal host primarily adopted the marcasite structure (m-CoSe
 <sub>2</sub>). However, previous studies have shown that the energies of the pyrite and marcasite structures of CoSe
 <sub>2</sub> are similar and so both the pyrite (p-CoSe
 <sub>2</sub>) and m-CoSe
 <sub>2</sub> phases were considered in this study for comparison. Additional details of the DFT calculations are presented in Supplementary Note
