<p id="Par34">The ex situ HRTEM and SAED patterns were obtained at different stages of discharge. Firstly, batteries were discharged up to the required potential using a LAND workstation and at the end of discharge, the batteries were opened in a glove box to collect sample material. Afterward, the samples were further used for TEM measurements. For ex situ XPS, the batteries were discharged up to the mentioned potential and after batteries were opened in the glove box and collected sample used for XPS analysis. The ex situ XPS of battery electrolyte was also performed after full discharge at 0.8â€‰V.</p>
