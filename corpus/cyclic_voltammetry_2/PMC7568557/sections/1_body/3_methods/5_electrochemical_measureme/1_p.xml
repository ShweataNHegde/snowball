<p id="Par35">The electrochemical measurements were performed using CR2032 coin-type cells. Films of the active materials were formed from a slurry of active material (cathode material), acetylene black (AB) carbon and polyvinylidene difluoride, mixed in the ratio of 8:1:1 in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone solvent. After mixing, the slurry was spread on a circular disk of aluminum with a doctor blade and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. CR2032 coin cells were assembled in an Ar filled glove box, pure sodium foil was used as a counter and a reference electrode and a Whatmann glass fiber disk was used as a separator with 1 M NaClO
 <sub>4</sub> in tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether as an electrolyte. The separator was used after drying at 120 °C for 12 h. The long cycle performance and rate capabilities were performed on LAND (Wuhan, China) electrochemical workstation in the potential window of 0.8–2.8 V and CV was performed at Arbin electrochemical workstation at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s
