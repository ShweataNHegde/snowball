<p id="Par32">The morphological investigations were done by FESEM (JSM-7800F, Japan), SEM (JSM-6510LV) and TEM (JEM-2100, Japan). The elemental composition was measured by EDS using EDS, JEOL-6300F. Phase purity and chemical compositions of all the samples were investigated by XRD (MAXima-X XRD-7000) in the range of 5–90° at a scan rate of 5° min
 <sup>−1</sup> and by XPS was using a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi electron spectrometer. TGA was performed to measure the sulfur contents in the host using an SDTQ600 analyzer (TA instrument) in the Ar atmosphere at 600 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup>. The textural properties (pore size and surface area) were investigated by nitrogen adsorption–desorption using BET (Quantachrome Instruments, USA).
