 <italic>Synthesis of S@BPCS:</italic> For the synthesis of sulfur cathode, the sulfur host and sublimed sulfur were well mixed in mortar with the weight ratio of 1:4 and then transferred to a heating boat covered with Al-foil and heated at 155 °C in a tube furnace for 12 h with a ramp rate of 2 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> under an Ar atmosphere. Additionally, the sulfur composite was heated at 190 °C for 30 min. to remove the excessive sulfur from the surface. Sulfur composites of all other metal chalcogenides were also prepared by the similar method.
