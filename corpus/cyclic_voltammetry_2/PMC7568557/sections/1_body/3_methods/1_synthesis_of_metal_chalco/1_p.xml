 <italic>Synthesis of Co-bipyramid prisms:</italic> Typically, 1.0 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and 0.135 g of cobalt acetate tetrahydrate were dissolved in 500 ml of ethanol at room temperature under sonication to form a clear solution. The solution was then heated to 90 °C under reflux conditions for 1.5 h. Afterward, the precipitates were collected via centrifugation at 2795 ×
