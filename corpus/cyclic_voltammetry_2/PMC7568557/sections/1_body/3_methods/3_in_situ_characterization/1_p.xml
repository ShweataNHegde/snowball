<p id="Par33">The in situ Raman spectra were collected using Lab-RAM HR Evolution (Horiba) Raman microscope (EL-CELL Germany), with excitation wavelengths laser of 532 nm under discharged/charged at a sweep rate of 1 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup> using CHI workstation (CHI 660D). For in situ XRD, the preparation method of half-cell was similar, 4 mm hole was punched on the steel caps and steel spacer on both the anode and cathode sides and the holes were completely sealed with Kapton film and an AB glue coating. To enhance the intensity of XRD peaks, a thicker layer of cathode material was deposited (7 mg cm

 <sup>2</sup>) on an aluminum substrate. The discharge/charge was performed on a LAND workstation (Wuhan, China) at a current density of 500 mA g
