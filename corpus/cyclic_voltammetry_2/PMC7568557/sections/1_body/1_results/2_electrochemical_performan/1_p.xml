<p id="Par10">To investigate chemical interactions between BPCS and NaPSs, ex situ XPS analysis was employed, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>. To understand the chemical interactions between the host BPCS and NaPSs we made three different samples for ex situ XPS as pure BPCS and two discharged cell samples at 2.0 and 0.8 V. The binding energies of cobalt decreases as electrons transfer from NaPSs to BPCS when discharged at 2.0 and 0.8 V, which is attributed to the strong chemical interaction between BPCS and NaPSs during the discharge process. This type of interaction between BPCS and NaPSs suppresses the shuttle effect, increases the cycling stability, and improves the capacity.
