<p id="Par14">In order to take full advantage of the high theoretical capacity of the S cathode, a high mass loading is a key factor to scale up the practical application of the Na–S battery. However, high loading of insulating sulfur will facilitate the shuttling of NaPSs and the capacity decay will be more serious with a decrease in the utilization rate of active sulfur and a decrease in the capacity of active sulfur. Therefore, it is still a great challenge to optimize the performance of high sulfur loading in Na–S batteries. Previous studies have reported that only batteries with a capacity greater than 4 mAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup> can exceed commercial LIBs
 <sup>

 </sup>. In addition to this, considering that the voltage of the Na–S battery is lower than that of SIBs, a higher areal capacity is required for the former system. In this work, with the mass loading of 4.4 mg cm
 <sup>−2</sup>, the capacity of the S@BPCS cathode was more than 4 mAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup>. To verify the superiority of the S@BPCS cathode, batteries with high mass contents of 7.3 and 9.1 mg cm
 <sup>−2</sup> were cycled at 0.5 C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d, e</xref>). An initial areal capacity of 6.24 mAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup> was measured and this value stabilized to 5.5 mAh cm
 <sup>−</sup>
 <sup>2</sup> after 10 cycles when the mass content was 7.3 mg cm
 <sup>−2</sup>. For sulfur content as high as 9.1 mg cm
 <sup>−2</sup>, the initial areal capacity of the S@BPCS cathode was 8 mAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup>, stabilizing at 6.6 mAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup> after 10 cycles. It is noteworthy that the current density is calculated to be as high as 9.7 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup>. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref> summarizes the areal capacities of different sulfur-loaded batteries. The electrode masses of 7.3 and 9.1 mg cm
 <sup>−2</sup> used in this study are much higher than those of previously reported Na–S batteries (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">22</xref>) and commercial LIBs (4.0 mg cm
 <sup>−2</sup>). To illustrate the importance of this work, we compared the capacity and rate capabilities of the Na–S batteries in Fig.
