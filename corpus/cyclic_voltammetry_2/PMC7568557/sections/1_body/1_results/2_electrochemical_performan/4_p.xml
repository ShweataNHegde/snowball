<p id="Par13">The rate performance of the sulfur cathodes was also measured. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref> shows the rate performance of S@BPCS at different current densities from 0.5 to 3 C. The cathode S@BPCS composite exhibits capacities as high as 755, 565, 475, 415, 382 and 349 mAh g
 <sup>−</sup>
 <sup>1</sup> at current densities of 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3 C, respectively. Compared to other metal chalcogenides, the S@BPCS composite has a higher rate capability, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">21</xref>. Also, when the current density was switched back to the initial value, the S@BPCS composite exhibits a high reversible capacity of 727 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> as compared to other metal chalcogenides (486, 432 and 399 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> for S@BPCO, S@BPCSE, and S@BPCTE, respectively). To the best of our knowledge, the S@BPCS composite has remarkable rate capabilities as compared with state-of-the-art materials previously reported in the Na–S battery literature, as shown in Fig.
