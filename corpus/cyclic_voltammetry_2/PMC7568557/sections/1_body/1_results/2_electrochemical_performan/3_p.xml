<p id="Par12">The GCD of the S@BPCS composite was also evaluated. Higher capacity and longer potential plateaus suggest that the BPCS sulfur host can assist as an electrocatalyst to accelerate the cathode redox reactions and enhance the utilization of active sulfur. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref> shows the 1st, 2nd, and 50th charge–discharge profiles of the S@BPCS composite electrode with 4.4 mg cm
 <sup>−2</sup> mass loading and 29 μm thickness (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16</xref>). The 1st reversible discharge capacity is 1347 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> at a high current density of 0.5 C and the profiles clearly show long plateaus. The plateaus at higher potentials are due to the formation of the solid–liquid state of sulfur and NaPSs, while, the plateaus at lower potential are due to the reduction of long-chain NaPSs (Na
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>8</sub>, Na
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>6</sub>, and Na
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>5</sub>) to short-chain polysulfides (Na
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>3</sub>, Na
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub>, and Na
 <sub>2</sub>S). The cycling performance of the S@BPCS composite shows excellent stability (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>), the specific capacity of 2nd discharge was 755 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> and after 350 cycles, it was 701 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> at a high current density of 0.5 C with 98.5% Coulombic efficiency. The coulombic efficiency of all the metal chalcogenide@S electrodes are given in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>. The capacity decay per cycle is 0.0126 %, which is significantly lower than anything previously reported in the literature (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">17</xref>). It is worth noting that pure BPCS has a negligible contribution to the capacity under the same charge-discharge conditions (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">18</xref>). The cycling performance of other metal chalcogenides is shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">19</xref>. In addition, the Celgard polymer separator was used to test the cycle performance of BPCS@S and KB@S, and compared with the glass fiber separator in the supporting information (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">20</xref>). When using the glass fiber separator instead of the Celgard polymer separator, diffusion of polysulfides is slowed because of its thickness and porous structure, resulting in good electrochemical performance.
