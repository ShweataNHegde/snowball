<p id="Par11">To examine the electrochemical storage properties and NaPSs redox reactions of polar catalytic BPCS and other metal chalcogenides, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) plots were recorded as shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">15</xref>. Impressively, the CV plot of S@BPCS exhibits comparatively higher current density and peak potential because of its high electrical conductivity as well as catalytic and high polar nature that results in enhanced electrical conductivity and strong chemical interaction between BPCS and NaPSs. The CV curves of the S@BPCS composite exhibit two reduction peaks. The peak at 2.12 V corresponds to the reduction of sulfur to long-chain Na-polysulfides (Na
