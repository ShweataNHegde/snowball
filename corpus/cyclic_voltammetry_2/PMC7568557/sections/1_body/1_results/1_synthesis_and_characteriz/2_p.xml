<p id="Par8">In order to study the structure and morphology of the as-prepared precursor, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>) along with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping was performed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). The bipyramid Co prisms were converted into hollow bipyramid Co/C prisms. To confirm the phase purity and hollow interior of Co/C, XRD and TEM tests were performed (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4b</xref>), respectively. Afterward, the Co/C hollow prisms were converted into Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>/C (BPCO). The phase purity and morphology of BPCO were investigated by XRD and FESEM, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e, f</xref>, respectively. FESEM images of BPCO show that it has a unique hierarchical surface with interweaving plate-like structures. To confirm the elemental composition, EDS mapping was performed, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>. Furthermore, BPCO was converted into CoS
 <sub>2</sub>/C (BPCS), CoSe
 <sub>2</sub>/C (BPCSE) and CoTe
 <sub>2</sub>/C (BPCTE) by an ion-exchange method, their formation and phase purity was confirmed by XRD analysis as represented in Supplementary Figs.
