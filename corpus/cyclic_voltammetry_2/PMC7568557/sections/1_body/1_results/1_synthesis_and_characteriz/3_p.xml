<p id="Par9">Furthermore, the chemical composition and morphology of BPCS was confirmed by TEM; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2h</xref> shows that the bipyramid hollow prisms of BPCS have 376 nm hollow wide space to accommodate sulfur and polysulfides within it. In addition, HRTEM and single-crystal spot transmission electron diffraction patterns confirm the synthesis of BPCS, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2i–k</xref>. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of BPCS is 119.9 m

 <sup>−1</sup> and the hysteresis loop is of type H4 indicates the physisorption isotherm of type I, which conforms to IUPAC, demonstrating that BPCS is composed of uniform slit-like pores, representing microporous structure, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref>. Finally, sulfur was injected into the hollow prisms using a melt-diffusion method to achieve the S@BPCS composite, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b–d</xref>. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> shows that sulfur efficiently steamed into the inner side of the prism wall and there is no sulfur agglomeration on the hierarchical surface of the BPCS, indicating sulfur removal from the surface at 190 °C. The XRD pattern of the S@BPCS composite confirms the cubic sulfur loading in the hollow bipyramid with interweaving plates like surfaced BPCS (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). An EDX line scan was recorded to examine the position of sulfur; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref> clearly shows sulfur efficaciously loaded inside the hollow prism. Furthermore, a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed to measure the content of loaded sulfur in the hollow prism S@BPCS composite. The mass of loaded sulfur was calculated using Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14</xref>, and determined to be as high as 64.5%.
