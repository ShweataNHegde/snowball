<p id="Par7">Inspired by the advantages of hollow, polar, interweaving surface structure, and catalytic activity of Co for Na–S batteries, we synthesized hollow polar bipyramid prism cobalt chalcogenides and used them as sulfur hosts. The bipyramid prisms of cobalt were synthesized by simple reflux methods (see “Methods” section). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern confirmed the formation of C
