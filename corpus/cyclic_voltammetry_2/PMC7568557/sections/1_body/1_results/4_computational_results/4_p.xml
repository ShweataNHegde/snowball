 </sub> phases is likely to be beneficial, in which reactions in the molecular state are expected to be facile. For example, if the binding of a Na

 <sub>2</sub> to Na
 <sub>2</sub>S is 1.82 V, a large overpotential of 1.23 V would be required to facilitate the reaction in the molecular state. If the cathode host binds the NaPSs too strongly, then the energy of the anchored Na
 <sub>2</sub>S molecule will be lower than the Na
 <sub>2</sub>S solid. Na
 <sub>2</sub>S molecules will therefore cover the cathode host surface instead of forming bulk Na
 <sub>2</sub>S particles, reducing the ability for it to catalyze further reactions. By balancing the energy between the anchored and bulk Na
