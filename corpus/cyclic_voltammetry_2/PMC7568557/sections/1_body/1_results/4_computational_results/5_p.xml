<p id="Par22">The formation energy of Na
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>y</sub> molecules bound to the marcasite p-CoSe
 <sub>2</sub> (100), m-CoSe
 <sub>2</sub> (010), m-CoSe
 <sub>2</sub> (101), and m-CoTe
 <sub>2</sub> (010) surfaces were also calculated, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">27</xref>. It can be seen from Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">27</xref> that all of the CoX
 <sub>2</sub> hosts strongly bind the NaPS molecules, resulting in formation energies that are close to those of the solid Na
 <sub>2</sub>S

 </sub> phases. For the Na
 <sub>2</sub>S end member, a small difference in the formation energy is observed on analogous surfaces of materials with the same structure, but with a different anion, i.e., p-CoS
 <sub>2</sub>(100) vs. p-CoSe
 <sub>2</sub>(100) and m-CoSe
 <sub>2</sub>(010) vs. m-CoTe
 <sub>2</sub>(010). The difference in the formation energy of a Na
 <sub>2</sub>S molecule is larger on different surfaces of the same structure, e.g., m-CoSe
 <sub>2</sub>(101) vs. m-CoSe
 <sub>2</sub>(010), suggesting that structural differences in these materials (pyrite vs marcasite) may play a more important role in this family of materials than the nature of the anion (i.e., S, Se, and Te). This result is in line with the experimental electrochemical results in Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S20</xref>, where the marcasite based BPCSE and BPCTE structures have similar rate performance, whereas the pyrite based BPCS structure has markedly better rate performance.
