<p id="Par18">DFT calculations were performed with the SCAN + rvv10 functional to understand the interactions of NaPSs with CoX
 <sub>2</sub> cathode hosts. The lattice parameters of the structures optimized with SCAN + rvv10 are in excellent agreement with experimental results, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">23</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. As can be seen from the density of states plots in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">24</xref>, there are states at the Fermi level in the spin up-channel for all structures resulting in half-metallic behavior. The binding of polysulfides to the surface of CoX
 <sub>2</sub> materials were further investigated with slab calculations. The energies of different surface terminations of pyrite (p-CoS
 <sub>2</sub>) and marcasite (m-CoTe
 <sub>2</sub>, m-CoSe
 <sub>2</sub>) CoX
 <sub>2</sub> structures are shown in Supplementary Table

 <sub>slab</sub> is the slab energy for a given surface (single point or relaxed surface),

 <sub>bulk</sub> is the energy of relaxed bulk geometry per formula unit, 
 <italic>N</italic> is the number of formula units in the slab, and

 <sub>2</sub> structures, the cheaper PBEsol functional was used instead of the SCAN + rvv10 functional. Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> shows the surface energy of the eight-lowest energy surfaces of p-CoS
 <sub>2</sub> and the ten lowest energy surfaces of m-CoSe
 <sub>2</sub> and m-CoTe
 <sub>2</sub>. As can be seen from Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>, the lowest energy surface for p-CoS
 <sub>2</sub> is (100), followed by the (210) surface, which is consistent with previous XRD and TEM results

 <sub>2</sub> and m-CoTe
 <sub>2</sub> marcasite structures, including the (010), (101), and (211) surfaces, which is consistent with low energy surfaces observed computationally and experimentally for analogous marcasite surfaces

 <sub>2</sub> and the (101) and (010) surfaces of m-CoSe
 <sub>2</sub> and m-CoTe
 <sub>2</sub> were chosen to study the binding of polysulfides. The geometries of all of the low energy slabs predicted with PBEsol were reoptimized with SCAN + rvv10 before further binding calculations.
