<p id="Par20">In comparison, the formation energy of all NaPSs bound to the p-CoS
 <sub>2</sub> (100) surface are lowered significantly, primarily due to the strong interaction between the Na
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>
  <italic>y</italic>
 </sub> molecules and the polar p-CoS
 <sub>2</sub> surface. The difference in the energy between the NaPSs bound to the p-CoS
 <sub>2</sub> (100) surface and the ‘liquid state’ increases systematically as the chain length, 
 <italic>y</italic>, decreases (
 <italic>x</italic> increases), reaching 2 eV for the Na
 <sub>2</sub>S molecule. As discussed further in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">26a</xref>, the strong binding of the NaPSs to the surface is related to charge transfer between the undercoordinated Co
 <sup>2+</sup> sites on the surface to the S atoms in the Na
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>
  <italic>y</italic>
 </sub> cluster.
