 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5j</xref>, the XRD pattern has a diffraction peak at 23.08°, which is indexed to the (240) plane of sulfur (JCPDF# 08-0247). The intensity of the sulfur vibrational band was reduced and a new vibrational band appears at 451 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> at a potential of 2.25 V, which is attributed to long-chain Na-polysulfides (Na

 <sub>8</sub>). This result was supported by in situ XRD, where the diffraction peak appearing at 22.95° is due to the formation of Na-polysulfides by the reduction of sulfur. After the long-chain Na-polysulfides reduced to short-chain polysulfides on further discharge, the reduction mechanism was studied. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, b</xref> shows HRTEM/SAED images, which confirm the reduction of sulfur to Na-polysulfides (Na
