<p id="Par17">Lastly, the visible difference in the adsorption of polysulfides in the BPCS was performed using a Na
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>6</sub> solution. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref> clearly shows that when carbon was added to the Na
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>6</sub> solution, there was no change in the yellow color of polysulfides whereas, when BPCS was added to Na
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>6</sub> solution, the yellowish color turns colorless after few hours demonstrating the strong interaction and adsorption capability of polar BPCS towards NaPSs. The S@BPCS composite has internal void space of about 376 nm, which is enough to provide adequate space for NaPSs and tolerate the strain during sodiation and desodiation as shown in Fig.
