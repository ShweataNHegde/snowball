<p id="Par6">Here, inspired by the above encouraging strategies of hollow, polar and catalytic S hosts, we synthesized a unique architecture, hollow polar bipyramid prism catalytic CoS
 <sub>2</sub>/C as a sulfur carrier (S@BPCS) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). S@BPCS is an efficient host for solid-phase S and NaPSs, because every bipyramid prism structure has a wide hollow cavity for sulfur loading and for the entrapment of NaPSs. When used as a cathode in Na–S batteries, S@BPCS exhibits good electrochemical performance with stable cycling and rate capability that suggests maximum utilization of S, strong binding of NaPSs, is catalytically active for converting long-chain polysulfides into small chain polysulfides, and it delivers good electrical conductivity. Here, the charge/discharge mechanisms of S@BPCS for reversible battery reactions have been studied using in situ Raman spectroscopy, in situ XRD, ex situ TEM, ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
