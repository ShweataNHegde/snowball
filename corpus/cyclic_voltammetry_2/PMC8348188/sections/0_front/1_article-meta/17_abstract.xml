 <p>The maximally disordered (MD) phases with the general formula Y
  <sub>5−x</sub>Pr
  <sub>x</sub>Sb
  <sub>3−y</sub>M
  <sub>y</sub> (M = Sn, Pb) are formed with partial substitution of Y by Pr and Sb by Sn or Pb in the binary Y
  <sub>5</sub>Sb
  <sub>3</sub> compound. During the electrochemical lithiation and sodiation, the formation of Y
  <sub>5-x</sub>Pr
  <sub>x</sub>Sb
  <sub>3-y</sub>M
  <sub>y</sub>Li
  <sub>z</sub> and Y
  <sub>5−x</sub>Pr
  <sub>x</sub>Sb
  <sub>3−y</sub>M
  <sub>y</sub>Na
  <sub>z</sub> maximally disordered–high entropy intermetallic phases (MD-HEIP), as the result of insertion of Li/Na into octahedral voids, were observed. Carbon nanotubes (CNT) are an effective additive to improve the cycle stability of the Y
  <sub>5−x</sub>Pr
  <sub>x</sub>Sb
  <sub>3−y</sub>M
  <sub>y</sub> (M = Sn, Pb) anodes for lithium-ion (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Modification of Y
  <sub>5−x</sub>Pr
  <sub>x</sub>Sb
  <sub>3−y</sub>Sn
  <sub>y</sub> alloys by carbon nanotubes allowed us to significantly increase the discharge capacity of both types of batteries, which reaches 280 mAh · g
  <sup>−1</sup> (for LIBs) and 160 mAh · g
  <sup>−1</sup> (for SIBs), respectively. For Y
  <sub>5−x</sub>PrxSb
  <sub>3−y</sub>Pb
  <sub>y</sub> alloys in which antimony is replaced by lead, these capacities are slightly smaller and are 270 mAh · g
  <sup>−1</sup> (for LIBs) and 155 mAh · g
  <sup>−1</sup> (for SIBs), respectively. Results show that structure disordering and CNT additives could increase the electrode capacities up to 30% for LIBs and up to 25% for SIBs.
