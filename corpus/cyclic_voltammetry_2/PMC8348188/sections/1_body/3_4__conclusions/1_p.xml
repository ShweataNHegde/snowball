 <sub>y</sub> (M = Sn, Pb) alloys by structure disordering and carbon nanotube additives allowed us to significantly increase the discharge capacity of both types of batteries, which reached 280 mAh · g
 <sup>−1</sup> (for LIBs) and 160 mAh · g
 <sup>−1</sup> (for SIBs), respectively. A CNT-modified electrode also shows higher corrosion resistance in electrolyte solutions and, as a result, demonstrates an increased battery life. The effect of the addition of CNTs and PVDF binder on the improvement of capacity and cycle stability of electrodes is due to the following factors: CNTs provide diffusion pathways for Li+ or Na+ ions to most of the grains inside the material, improving charge/discharge kinetics; PVDF provides good adhesion between the electrode materials and current collectors, giving excellent electrochemical, mechanical, and thermal stability of electrodes.
