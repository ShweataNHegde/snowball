The single crystals data were collected using an automatic four-circle Xcalibur Oxford Diffraction diffractometer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) with CCD detector (graphite monochromatized Mo-radiation, ω-scan mode). The analytical absorption corrections were made by CrysalisRed [
