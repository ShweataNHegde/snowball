<p>The maximally disordered Y
 <sub>5−x</sub>Pr

 <sub>3−y</sub>M
 <sub>y</sub> (M = Sn, Pb; 0 ≤ x,y ≤ 0.5) alloys were prepared from high purity metals: yttrium (ingot, 99.9 at.%, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA), praseodymium (ingot, 99.9 at.%, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA), antimony (rod, 99.99 at.%, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA), tin (99.8%, shot, 3 mm, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) and lead (shot, &lt;2 mm, 99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA). These alloys were synthesized by arc-melting of pure metals under the argon atmosphere. The Y

 <sub>y</sub> alloy were used. The samples synthesized by the thermal method were annealed at 670 K for 24 h. The reaction product was analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) using Rigaku MiniFlex 600 powder diffractometer (Cu-radiation), Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan. The phase content of alloys was determined by means of a TESCAN VEGA3 electron microscope (Tescan, Brno, Czech Republic) equipped with Oxford Instruments energy dispersive X-ray analyzer, Aztec ONE system, High Wycombe, UK. In some cases, the flame photometry (Flapho-4 flame photometer, Carl Zeiss Jena, Jena, Germany) for detection of lithium was used.
