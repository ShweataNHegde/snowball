<p>Multi-cycle chronopotentiometry (CP), voltammetry (CVA) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed in three-electrode Swagelok-type cells. All electrochemical measurements were carried out by means of the electrochemical station from CH Instruments (Austin, TX, USA) and 8 Channel Battery Analyzer (BST8-MA, MTI Corporation, Richmond, CA, USA). Galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles were received at

 <sup>−2</sup>. The cyclic voltammograms were registered at scan rate = 0.001 V/s. The impedance spectra were taken on electrodes cycled between 1 and 4.5 V using a 0.001 Hz–100 kHz frequency range. To determine the values of the standard deviation for discharge capacity and parameters of EIS measurements, the experiments were repeated three times. The relative standard deviation of discharge capacities does not exceed 8%. The relative standard deviation for all EIS parameters does not exceed 12%.
