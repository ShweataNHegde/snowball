<p>The lithium-ion cells contain prepared alloy as a working electrode with Li reference and LiCoO
 <sub>2</sub> counter electrodes. The sodium-ion cells contain Na as a reference and Na
 <sub>x</sub>CoO
 <sub>2</sub> as counter electrodes, respectively. The ethylencarbonate/dimethylcarbonate nonaqueous electrolyte, containing Li
 <sup>+</sup> or Na
 <sup>+</sup> ions were used. The anode and cathode were separated by Celgard 2320 separator (Celgrad, Charlotte, CA, USA) impregnated with an electrolyte.
