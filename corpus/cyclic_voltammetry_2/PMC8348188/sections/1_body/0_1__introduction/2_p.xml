<p>The rationale for the use of high entropy alloys as electrode materials is based on the assumption defined by Jien-Wei Yeh and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B7-materials-14-04331" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] that the presence of several (five or more) elements in the alloy would increase the configurational entropy of mixing by an amount sufficient to overcome the enthalpies of compound formation, thereby, inhibiting the formation of potentially undesirable additional intermetallics. So, at the increasing of the number of elements in an alloy, the entropic contribution to the total free energy would overcome the enthalpic contribution and, thereby, stabilize solid solution phases [

In some metallic systems, depending on the composition of the alloys, ordered intermetallic compounds, limited solid solutions, and unlimited solid solutions can be formed simultaneously [
