<p>Chawla et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-materials-14-04331" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] described the inclusion of Pd catalyst in CNT cathode materials in Li-O
 <sub>2</sub> batteries and received electrochemical data with significant improvement in discharge capacities. The batteries with CNTs and Pd catalyst cycled have 35% more cycles. The activity of the germanium catalyst was investigated to improve the electrochemical performance of SnO
 <sub>2</sub>/graphene nanocomposite anode material for LIBs [
