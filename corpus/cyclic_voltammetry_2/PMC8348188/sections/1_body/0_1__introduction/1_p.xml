<p>Intermetallics with sufficiently large interatomic voids are favorable for the insertion of lithium or sodium ions. The intermetallic compound LaSn
 <sub>3</sub> (AuCu
 <sub>3</sub>-type) as a possible negative electrode for the lithium-ion batteries was described by Vaughey et al. [
 <xref rid="B1-materials-14-04331" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The insertion of lithium atoms into octahedral voids of hexagonal Zr
 <sub>5</sub>Sn
 <sub>3</sub> and RE
 <sub>5</sub>M
 <sub>3</sub> (RE = Y, La and Gd; M = Ge and Sn) binary phases were described earlier by us [
 <xref rid="B2-materials-14-04331" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-materials-14-04331" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-materials-14-04331" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The crystal structure of RE
 <sub>5</sub>M
 <sub>3</sub> intermetallic compounds belongs to Mn
 <sub>5</sub>Si
 <sub>3</sub>-type. The RE atoms are located at 4
 <italic>d</italic> and 6
 <italic>g</italic> sites, respectively. The M components (Ge or Sn or Pb atoms) are located at the additional 6
 <italic>g</italic> site. For this binary structure, the presence of an octahedral void in the 2
 <italic>b</italic> site is typical. The incorporation of the third element (alkaline or transitions metals, marked as T) into the 2
 <italic>b</italic> site leads to the realization of the RE
 <sub>5</sub>TM
 <sub>3</sub> ternary phase with a Hf
 <sub>5</sub>CuSn
 <sub>3</sub> structure type [
 <xref rid="B5-materials-14-04331" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. We detected the new ternary phase of Tb
 <sub>5</sub>LiSn
 <sub>3</sub> with fully filled 2
 <italic>b</italic> site (Hf
 <sub>5</sub>CuSn
 <sub>3</sub> structure type) during the systematic study of the alloys of Tb—Li—Sn system [
 <xref rid="B6-materials-14-04331" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The La
 <sub>5</sub>Li
 <sub>x</sub>Ge
 <sub>3</sub> phase, which formed by partial incorporation (up to x = 0.4) of lithium atoms into octahedral voids of the La
 <sub>5</sub>Ge
 <sub>3</sub> binary, was observed in La—Li—Ge system [
