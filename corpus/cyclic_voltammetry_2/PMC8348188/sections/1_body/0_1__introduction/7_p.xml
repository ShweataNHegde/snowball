<p>In this study, we implemented two goals: first, we determined the effect of disordering the structure of Y
 <sub>5−x</sub>Pr
 <sub>x</sub>Sb
 <sub>3−y</sub>M
 <sub>y</sub> (M = Sn, Pb) electrodes due to component substitution, and second, we determined the effect of a modifying additive (CNT) on the electrochemical activity of electrodes for LIBs and SIBs. A CNT-modified electrode shows better kinetics of Li
 <sup>+</sup> /Na
 <sup>+</sup> intercalation into electrodes and higher corrosion resistance in electrolyte solutions and, as a result, increases the battery life. The positive effect of these two actions leads to improved cyclic stability and increased electrode capacity up to 30% for LIBs and up to 25% for SIBs.
