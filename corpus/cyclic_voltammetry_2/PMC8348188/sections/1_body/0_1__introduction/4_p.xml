<p>It is shown that increasing entropy by introducing one or more elements leads to a completely different electrochemical behavior and stability of cycles. In addition, there is a unique opportunity to fine-tune the electrochemical characteristics of high-entropy materials, using the different effects of each element on the electrochemical processes. Based on these studies, a possible reaction mechanism is proposed, which takes into account the stabilization of entropy and the maintenance of the invariance of the structure of the initial matrix throughout the cycling process.</p>
