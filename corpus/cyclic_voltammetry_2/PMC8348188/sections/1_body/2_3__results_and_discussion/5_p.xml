<p>After several initial cycles of electrochemical lithiation/delithiation, as well as sodiation/desodiation of disk electrodes that were cut from the alloy, their amorphization was observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-04331-f002">Figure 2</xref>d–i), and their capacity decreased slightly. After 5–8 cycles of activation, the electrodes stabilized and could continue to operate for many cycles without significant loss of capacity. There are no significant differences when using electrodes that were made by pressing powders from crushed alloys. It should be noted that the electrodes from the ordered binary phaseY
 <sub>5</sub>Sb
 <sub>3</sub> have a discharge capacity in the range of 200 mAh · g
 <sup>−1</sup> (for LIBs) and 120 mAh · g
 <sup>−1</sup> (for SIBs), respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-04331-f004">Figure 4</xref>). The use of electrodes from the MD phases increases the discharge capacitance for both LIBs and SIBs by almost 10%. Moreover, slightly higher values of capacitance have electrodes in which the Sb atoms are replaced by Sn, in comparison with electrodes in which the Sb are replaced by Pb atoms.
