<p>Electrochemical studies have shown that the optimal amount of CNT is 10 wt.%. It has been experimentally established that if the content of carbon nanotubes in the electrodes exceeds 10 wt.%, for example, 15 wt.%, the capacity and cyclic characteristics of the electrodes begin to deteriorate due to the formation of grains of carbide phases during sintering. It is also important to ensure the mechanical stability of the electrodes so that they do not crack during numerous charge–discharge cycles. This is realized by adding a binder material, the optimal amount of which was 10 wt.%. The addition of CNTs and PVDF binder to electrodes improved capacity and their cycles’ stability. The CNTs provided diffusion pathways for Li+ or Na+ ions to most of the grains inside the material, improving charge/discharge kinetics, and the PVDF binder provided good adhesion between the electrode materials and current collectors, giving excellent electrochemical, mechanical, and thermal stability of electrodes. Modification of alloys with carbon nanotubes allowed us to significantly increase the discharge capacity of both types of batteries as LIBs and SIBs (

 <sub>y</sub> (M = Sn, Pb) alloys by carbon nanotubes allowed us to significantly increase the discharge capacity of both types of batteries, which reached 280 mAh · g

 <sup>−1</sup> (for SIBs), respectively. These maximum capacities are for Y
 <sub>5-x</sub>Pr

 <sub>3-y</sub>Sn
 <sub>y</sub> alloy electrodes in which antimony is partially replaced by tin. For Y
 <sub>5-x</sub>Pr
 <sub>x</sub>Sb
 <sub>3-y</sub>Pb
 <sub>y</sub> alloys in which antimony is replaced by lead, these capacities are slightly smaller and are 270 mAh · g
 <sup>−1</sup> (for LIBs) and 155 mAh · g
 <sup>−1</sup> (for SIBs), respectively. The study of cyclic stability shows that for CNT-modified electrodes after 50 cycles of charge–discharge, capacity decreases by no more than 8% (
