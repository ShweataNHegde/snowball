<p>CNT additives fill the intergranular space during sintering and improve the electrical connectivity within the electrode, thus, improving capacity by connecting and maintaining more electron conduction pathways between the active material and the current collector and then, finally, increasing the specific capacities and cycle stability of electrodes.</p>
