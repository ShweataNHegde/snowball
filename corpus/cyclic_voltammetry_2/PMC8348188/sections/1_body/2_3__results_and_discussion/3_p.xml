<p>For detailed structural analysis and to confirm that the obtained phases were MD-HEIP, a thorough high-precision structural study was performed using single-crystal X-ray methods. Two single crystals were selected from thermally synthesized and homogenized alloys Y
 <sub>4.5</sub>Pr
 <sub>0.5</sub>Sb
 <sub>2.5</sub>Sn
 <sub>0.5</sub>Li and Y
 <sub>4.5</sub>Pr
 <sub>0.5</sub>Sb
 <sub>2.5</sub>Sn
 <sub>0.5</sub>Na and used to completely determine the crystal structure. Initial X-ray studies showed that all single crystals had the same hexagonal structure as Hf
 <sub>5</sub>CuSn
 <sub>3</sub>-type, which is a filled variant of the Mn
 <sub>5</sub>Si
 <sub>3</sub>-type, in which the binary phase of Y
 <sub>5</sub>Sb
 <sub>3</sub> crystallizes. Since these phases are multicomponent, it was important to more accurately determine the distribution of atoms in the crystallographic positions, which allows us to make an X-ray single crystal method. General information on the obtained structural results is summarized in
