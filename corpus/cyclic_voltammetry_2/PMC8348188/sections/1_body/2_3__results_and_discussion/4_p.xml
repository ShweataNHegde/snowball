<p>The structural feature of these phases based on the possibility of insertion/deinsertion of lithium and sodium atoms into octahedral voids prompted the study of the possibility of carrying out these processes using electrochemical methods. The insertion of lithium or sodium atoms significantly increases the volume of the unit cell, more significantly along the lattice period 
 <italic>c</italic>, since in this direction, the octahedron expands more during the insertion of atoms (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-04331-f003">Figure 3</xref>). At the insertion of Li into octahedra, the volume of the unit cell increases by 4.65 Å
 <sup>3</sup>, and there are even greater changes up to 11.36 Å
 <sup>3</sup> when sodium atoms are inserted.
