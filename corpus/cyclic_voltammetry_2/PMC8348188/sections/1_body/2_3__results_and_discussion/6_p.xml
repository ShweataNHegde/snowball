<p>The next important step was the modification of the electrodes by carbon nanotubes in order to increase their capacity and improve cyclic stability. This modification was performed for MD phases of Y
 <sub>5−x</sub>Pr
 <sub>x</sub>Sb
 <sub>3−y</sub>Sn
 <sub>y</sub> and Y
 <sub>5−x</sub>Pr
 <sub>x</sub>Sb
 <sub>3−y</sub>Pb
 <sub>y</sub>. Different amounts of CNT were added, namely 5, 10, and 15 wt.% to alloys with subsequent mixing, pressing, and sintering. For example, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-04331-f005">Figure 5</xref> shows the SEM images of the initial alloy, nanotubes, and the product of their sintering. It is seen that the nanotubes wrap the grains of the alloy, filling the intergranular space.
