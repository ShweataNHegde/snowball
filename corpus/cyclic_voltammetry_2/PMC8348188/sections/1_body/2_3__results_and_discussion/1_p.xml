<p>Disordered and high-entropy alloys are suitable for the development of advanced materials with unique properties that cannot be achieved by conventional materials based only on ordered phases. High-entropy alloys can be used to create materials with high heat resistance and oxidation resistance, with improved mechanical, magnetic, and electrochemical properties. The MD and MD-HEIP were received from Y
 <sub>5</sub>Sb
 <sub>3</sub> by concept based on two mechanisms: 
 <italic>substitution</italic> and 
 <italic>insertion</italic>. For the partial substitution of the Y atoms in crystallographic positions 4
 <italic>d</italic> and 6
 <italic>g,</italic> the Pr atoms were used, and Sn or Pb atoms were used for the partial substitution of Sn. As a result of this substitution, a MD phase of Y
 <sub>5−x</sub>Pr
 <sub>x</sub>Sb
 <sub>3−y</sub>M
 <sub>y</sub> is formed. The structure of the Y
 <sub>5</sub>Sb
 <sub>3</sub> binary phase contains typical empty octahedral voids in which lithium or sodium can be inserted. Moreover, atoms can be inserted in an octahedral void either thermally or electrochemically.
