 <p>Electrocatalytic materials offer numerous benefits due to their wide range of applications. In this study, a polyol technique was used to synthesize PdNi nanoparticles (NPs) with different percent atomic compositions (Pd = 50 to 90%) to explore their catalytic efficiency. The produced nanoparticles were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electrochemical investigations. According to XRD measurements, the synthesized NPs were crystalline in nature, with crystallite sizes of about 2 nm. The electrochemical properties of the synthesized NPs were studied in alkaline solution through a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) technique of cyclic voltammetry. The PdNi nanoparticles supported on carbon (PdNi/C) were used as electrocatalysts and their activity and stability were compared with the homemade Pd/C and Pt/C. In alkaline solution, PdNi/C electrocatalysts showed improved oxygen reduction catalytic activity over benchmark Pd/C and Pt/C electrocatalysts in all composition ratios. Furthermore, stability experiments revealed that PdNi 50:50 is more stable in alkaline solution than pure Pd and other PdNi compositions.</p>
