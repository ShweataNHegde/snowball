<p>The oxygen reduction reaction was carried out in alkaline solution in the presence of nanoelectrocatalysts; Pd/C, PdNi/C (in five different atomic ratios of both metals) and Pt/C. The physical and electrochemical properties of the synthesized series of catalysts were thoroughly investigated. XRD data confirmed the alloy formation between the Pd and Ni metals with a crystalline nature and approximately 2 nm crystallite sizes. In all ratios, the catalytic efficiency of PdNi/C was better than the benchmark Pd/C and Pt/C. Among the different ratios of the PdNi/C, the catalytic activity of PdNi/C 50:50 was significantly higher than that of homemade Pd/C and Pt/C and its other ratios. Because the ORR proceeded by a four-electron mechanism in alkaline medium, the formation of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> was low when PdNi/C catalysts were utilized. The presence of Ni in the alloy, which increased the ECSA for hydrogen peroxide adsorption, was confirmed by CV curves. With a decrease in H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> output, all PdNi/C catalysts outperformed Pd/C and Pt/C in terms of specific and mass activities for ORR. PdNi/C catalysts have shown stability over Pd/C and Pt/C, with up to 1000 cycles in alkaline solutions. To summarize, PdNi/C electrocatalysts outperform standard electrocatalysts in terms of catalytic activity and stability in an alkaline medium, proving to be a cost-effective and stable elecrocatalyst for ORR in an alkaline medium.
