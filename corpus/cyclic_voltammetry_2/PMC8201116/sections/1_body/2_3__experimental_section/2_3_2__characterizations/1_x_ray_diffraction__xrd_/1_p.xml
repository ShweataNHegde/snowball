<p>The X-ray experiments were conducted in a Rigaku equipment, model D Max 2500PC, in the range of 20 to 100 degrees in 2 theta, scan rate of 1 degree min
 <sup>−1</sup>, and incident radiation wavelength of 1.5406 Å (Cu K α). The lattice constant and average crystallite size were investigated using XRD findings.
