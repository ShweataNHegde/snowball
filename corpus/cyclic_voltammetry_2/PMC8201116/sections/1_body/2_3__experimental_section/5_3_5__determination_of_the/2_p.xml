<p>CV measurements were first carried out in the potential range of 0.050 to 1 V vs RHE in order to evaluate the real surface area of Pd electrocatalysts. The experiments were performed by adjusting the higher positive potential limit with varied potential intervals (0.050 V and 0.025 V) up to 1.650 V to identify the potential where one monolayer of Pd-oxide is created. These tests were carried out at a scan rate of 50 mV s
 <sup>âˆ’1</sup> in a 0.5 M H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> solution that was kept saturated with argon (Ar). For each potential limit, a new catalyst layer was applied. The charges were estimated by integrating the PdO reduction peaks for each experiment performed up to a specific voltage limit. The palladium oxide monolayer completion was used to measure the electrochemical active area of the prepared nanomaterials.
