<p>The real surface area of the Pt can be determined using standard cyclic voltammetry because only hydrogen adsorption happened on the surface of the Pt electrocatalyst. However, due to adsorption and absorption on the surface of the Pd electrocatalysts, the same method is inconvenient for calculating the true surface area of the Pd electrocatalysts. As a result, calculating electrochemical surface active area (ECSA) from hydrogen adsorption/desorption peaks in the potential deposition region is difficult. Because of the uncertain chemical surface nature of the PdNi/C alloys, the CO stripping approach is likewise ineffective. Consequently, the reduction charges of Pd oxides were used to determine the electrochemical active area of all synthesized nanomaterials.</p>
