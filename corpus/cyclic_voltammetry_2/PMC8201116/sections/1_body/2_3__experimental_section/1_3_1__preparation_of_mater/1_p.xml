<p>In the dioctylether, nanoparticles of PdNi supported on carbon (PdNi/C) at varied atomic ratios were produced. Metallic precursors of Pd(II) acetylacetonate (Sigma Aldrich: St. Louis, MO, USA) and Ni(II) acetylacetonate (Aldrich) were employed in these experiments. Metal precursors, reduction reagent 1, 2-hexadecanediol, and dioctylether were mixed in a conical flask. The resulting mixture was heated to 110 °C with a constant supply of an inert gas. During the experiment, two compounds were added to control agglomeration, that is, oleylamine and oleic acid. To create nanoparticles (NPs), the temperature of this process was increased until it reached reflux (298 °C). Black colored PdNi NPs were formed, which were subsequently cooled in an open atmosphere. Following that, these NPs were supported on carbon (Vulcan XC-72, Cabot) in the presence of n-hexane and stirred for 12 h. PdNi NPs were washed with different solutions after filtration, including double distilled water, acetone, and ethanol. The washed NPs were dried in an oven for two hours at 80 degrees Celsius [
