<p>Cyclic voltammetry was used to investigate the general electrochemical behavior by recording cyclic voltammograms (CVs). CVs were recorded in alkaline solutions for all prepared electrocatalysts. In alkaline medium, the CV studies were conducted in the potential range of −0.876 to 0.074 V (vs. Hg/HgO/OH
 <sup>−</sup> electrode), which is comparable to (0.050–1 V vs. RHE) at a scan rate of 50 mV s
 <sup>–1</sup>. The experiments were carried out in argon-saturated solutions of 0.1 M NaOH. The rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) technique was used to measure polarization curves in O
 <sub>2</sub> saturated alkaline solution to assess catalytic activity for the ORR. A ring-disk electrode with a platinum ring (0.186 cm
 <sup>2</sup> geometric area) around a glassy carbon disk (0.247 cm
 <sup>2</sup> geometric area) was employed as the working electrode, and a catalyst layer was deposited on the disk electrode.
