<p>A Pine CBP potentiostat and a three-electrode electrochemical cell were used to make the electrochemical measurements. The working electrodes were a rotating ring-disk electrode (for ORR and CV) and a glassy carbon disk with a layer of the catalyst deposited on its surface (for accelerated stability test). The auxiliary electrode was a platinum wire, whereas the reference electrodes were mercury/mercury oxide (vs. Hg/HgO/OH
 <sup>âˆ’</sup>) and reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).
