<p>The polarization curves were collected in alkaline medium at a sweep rate of 0.005 mV s
 <sup>–1</sup> in the potential range of −0.876 to 0.074 V (versus. Hg/HgO/OH
 <sup>−</sup>). The amount of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> generated was determined by the oxidation current on the ring, while the amount of oxygen reduced was determined by the current generated by the reaction on the disk. The RRDE was operated at different rotation speeds (1225, 1600, 2025, 2500 rpm). These experiments were carried out in oxygen-saturated 0.1 M NaOH solutions.
