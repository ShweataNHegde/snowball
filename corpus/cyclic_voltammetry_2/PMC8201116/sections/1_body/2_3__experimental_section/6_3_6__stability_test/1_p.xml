<p>For a cathode fuel cell, one of the most important characteristics of the electrocatalyst is stability. In order to study long-term accelerated stability testing in both acid and alkaline media, 150 cycles in acidic medium and 1000 cycles in alkaline medium were swept. The continuous potentials between 0.05–1 V (vs. RHE) and −0.876 to 0.074 V (vs. Hg/HgO/OH
 <sup>−</sup>) were measured at a scan rate of 0.050 V s
 <sup>–1</sup> in Ar saturated 0.5 M H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> and 0.1 M NaOH media. The effect of degradation on electrochemical active area and other kinetic parameters was measured before and after the stability test in both acidic and alkaline solutions, whereas ORR catalytic activity was measured using a linear sweep voltammetry in an electrolyte continuously bubbled with oxygen. A Pine CBP potentiostat was used in all electrochemical studies.
