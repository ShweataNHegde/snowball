<p>An ultra-thin layer of the catalyst was deposited on a glassy carbon electrode (0.247 cm
 <sup>2</sup> geometric area). The resulting electrode was employed as working electrode in the electrochemical measurements. For this, the appropriate amount of catalyst powder was suspended in 1 mL of isopropanol containing 15 μL of Nafion solution for 15 min under continuous ultrasonic stirring. The complete suspension of the catalyst powder resulted in a black ink, which was then applied on the glassy carbon electrode. With the help of a micro-syringe, a suitable volume of suspension was applied to create a layer with a load of 30 μg cm
 <sup>−2</sup> of active metal. After the formation of an ultra-thin layer of catalyst over the electrode surface, it was hydrated with ultra-pure water.
