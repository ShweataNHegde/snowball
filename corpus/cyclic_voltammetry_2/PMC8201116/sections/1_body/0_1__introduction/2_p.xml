<p>It is thought that combining transition metals with Pd improves its catalytic ability for oxygen reduction. Palladium alloys containing other transition metals have shown increased oxygen reduction efficiencies [

The addition of transition metals to Pd alloys alters the structural properties of the developed alloy, and the electronic bands of Pd exhibit different electrical charge transportation efficiency as a result of these structural changes [
