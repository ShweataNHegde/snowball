<p>To develop an efficient electrode for oxygen reduction, transition metal such as nickel (Ni) was added to palladium in various ratios in the current study and tested for its oxygen reduction capabilities. The polyol method was used to prepare PdNi electrocatalysts with different atomic ratios, which were then supported on carbon. The nanoelectrocatalysts that were synthesized are thought to be able to reduce oxygen molecules and would have a higher stability than previously reported expensive electrocatalysts. The structural and physical behaviors of the prepared samples were determined using XRD. Because the support material was carbon rather than an oxide or a mix of oxides, FTIR is not a primary technique for the PdNi supported on carbon. The morphology of materials can be determined using TEM or HRTEM. We did not employ TEM or HRTEM because our main focus is on electrocatalysis rather than morphology. The oxygen reduction activity of the prepared materials was calculated by electrochemical measurements using the RRDE process. The alkalinity of medium was maintained with dilute sodium hydroxide (NaOH) during the experiments to compare the oxygen reduction activities of the catalysts in alkaline medium and check their stabilities.</p>
