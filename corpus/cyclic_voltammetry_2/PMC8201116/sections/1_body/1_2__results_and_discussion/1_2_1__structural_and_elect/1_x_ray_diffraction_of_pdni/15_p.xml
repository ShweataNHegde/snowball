<p>As a result of the PdO monolayer completion approach, the electrochemical active area of Pd/C and PdNi/C has been determined. In comparison to Pd/C, the inflexion point in PdNi/C 60:40 and PdNi/C 50:50 is shifted to lower charge values in the continually rising potentials. This could be due to the second metal, Ni, interfering. For DC, a similar finding has been observed [
