 <xref rid="molecules-26-03440-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows that the lattice constant falls as the atomic percentage of Ni increases in all PdNi/C ratios, demonstrating the creation of an alloy between Pd and Ni [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-03440" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, when comparing PdNi/C alloys to reference Pd/C, the reduction in lattice parameter revealed a lattice contraction due to the partial replacement of Pd sites in PdNi/C alloys by smaller Ni atoms. A similar finding has already been reported in the literature [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-26-03440" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The decrease in Pd-Pd distance for all of the prepared PdNi/C catalysts is explained by changes in the lattice parameter.
