<p>The different values of the inflexion points were recognized as the charge corresponding to the formation of a complete PdO monolayer for different proportion of Pd/Ni. The reference charge Q/μC was computed from the value of Pd per unit surface area, which is in close agreement with the literature value, that is, 420 μC/cm
