 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> with varied upper potential limits ranging from 1V to 1.650 V (vs. RHE) for the computation of electrochemical active area of PdNi/C (50:50). This probable potential range has been chosen based on the literature [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-03440" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The oxide reduction peak has been seen to increase with the stepwise increase of potential ranges from 1 to 1.650 V (vs. RHE). Furthermore, cyclic voltammograms revealed that an increase in potential corresponds to a higher oxide reduction peak for each material.
