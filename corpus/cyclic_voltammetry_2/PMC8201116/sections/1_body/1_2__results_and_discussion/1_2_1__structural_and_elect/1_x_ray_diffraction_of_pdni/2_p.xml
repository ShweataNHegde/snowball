<p>When comparing the signals for PdNi/C to the reference monometallic Pd/C catalyst, the signals for all proportions are sequence wise shifted toward higher values of 2θ. This change in peak position is commonly interpreted as evidence of alloy production, which results in lattice contraction. When compared to the other materials including reference Pd, the shift in 2θ towards higher values is more pronounced in the PdNi/C 50:50 material, most likely due to a higher incorporation of the second metal, which leads to a smaller lattice spacing. The inclusion of Ni also resulted in a reduction in particle size, as demonstrated by the widening of the peaks. These findings are consistent with those seen in the literature [

Furthermore, PdNi/C nanoparticles have lower lattice parameter values than Pd/C nanoparticles, showing that the metals (PdNi) have been alloyed [
