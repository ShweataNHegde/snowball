<p>In the preceding Equation (1), 
 <italic>λ</italic> is the incident radiation’s wavelength, 
 <italic>ω</italic> is the peak width at half intensity, and 
 <italic>θ</italic> is the highest intensity position. Because the particles are assumed to be spherical, the factor 0.9 emerges. The peak with indices 220 of the Pd fcc structure was chosen in the computations because the broad carbon peak has no effect in this region. The apparent lattice parameter at (220) diffraction and the corresponding Pd-Pd distance were also estimated.
