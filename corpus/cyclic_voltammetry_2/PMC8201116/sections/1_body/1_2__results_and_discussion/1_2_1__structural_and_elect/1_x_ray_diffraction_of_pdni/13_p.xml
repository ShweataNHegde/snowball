<p>Furthermore, the integrated charge (after double layer correction) for the reduction of oxygen-covered Pd surface was plotted as a function of the upper potential limit from 1 to 1.650 V as given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03440-f004">Figure 4</xref>b (PdNi/C 50:50). The coordinates at the point where the straight line changes its slope (potential/V versus Q/C) correspond to the formation of a complete PdO monolayer when the reference is taken into account. In
