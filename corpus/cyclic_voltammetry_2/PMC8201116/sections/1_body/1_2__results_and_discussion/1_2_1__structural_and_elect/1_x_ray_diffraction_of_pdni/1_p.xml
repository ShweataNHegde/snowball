<p>X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to characterize the structural properties of the Pd/C and PdNi/C catalysts, and the results are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03440-f001">Figure 1</xref>. The usual signs of Pd face centred cubic (fcc) structure can be seen in the XRD pattern. In the XRD pattern of any of the PdNi catalysts, the signals show the characteristic peaks of the fcc structure of Pd. In general, the main peaks of PdNi/C lie between the signals of Pd/C and pure Ni, 2θ in degrees are indicated at the bottom of

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03440-f001">Figure 1</xref> clearly shows five peaks: The peak at 2θ around 25 degrees; the diffraction peak corresponds to the indices (002) indicating the planes of carbon Vulcan XC-72. The other four peaks for Pd/C appeared at around 39° (Pd (111)), 46° (Pd (200)), 67° (Pd (220)) and 80° (Pd (311)) also confirm the presence of Pd in the prepared alloy. Similar result has been reported in the literature [
