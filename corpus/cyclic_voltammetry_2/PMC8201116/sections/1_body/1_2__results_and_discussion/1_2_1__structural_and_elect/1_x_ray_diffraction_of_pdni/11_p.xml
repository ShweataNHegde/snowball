<p>According to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03440-f003">Figure 3</xref>, the lattice parameter of PdNi solutions is dependent on the Ni content, as evidenced by literature [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-03440" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], with PdNi/C solid phase lattice parameter (
 <italic>a</italic>
 <sub>alloy</sub> 3.762) at Ni molar proportion of 0.436 and Pd/C lattice parameter (
 <italic>a</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> 3.990). Furthermore, the resulting XRD data were plotted with PdNi solid solution data described in the literature. Its figure revealed that a lattice constant of 3.86 corresponds to a PdNi alloy with a Ni content of roughly 11% [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-03440" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It can be concluded from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03440-f003">Figure 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03440-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> that the uniformed strain fugitive Ni fraction from the alloy phase in PdNi/C (90:10, 80:20, 70:30, 60:40, and 50:50) is around 11%. The molar fraction (Ni) will be larger if Ni is included in the Pd/C lattice parameter. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03440-f003">Figure 3</xref> also shows a curve of uniform Pd strain with lattice parameter (
 <italic>a</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> = 3.970) for further comparison. The uniform strain reduces as the percent of Ni increases in the calculation from reference Pd to PdNi solid solution (
 <italic>a</italic>
 <sub>alloy</sub> = 0.436) devoid of any strain. For various Pd-based alloys, a comparable conclusion has been examined [
