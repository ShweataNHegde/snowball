 <xref rid="molecules-26-03440-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> lists the estimated values of electrochemical active surface area (ESA) of Pd/C and PdNi/C with various percent atomic compositions. The active area reduces as the percent of Pd in Pd/Ni decreases, according to the findings. For example, the computed area of pure Pd/C is 3.45 cm
 <sup>2</sup>, while it is roughly 1.17 cm
 <sup>2</sup> for the PdNi/C 50:50 ratio. Furthermore, the Pt/C electrochemical active area was determined using the hydrogen adsorption/desorption region in cyclic voltammetry as well as Equation (6) and shown in
