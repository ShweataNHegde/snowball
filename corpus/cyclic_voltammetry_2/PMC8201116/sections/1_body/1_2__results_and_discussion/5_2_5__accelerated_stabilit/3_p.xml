 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03440-f011">Figure 11</xref> also shows the relative charge of Pd/C, PdNi/C (different proportions), and Pt/C. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03440-f011">Figure 11</xref> followed the previous discussion in terms of overall Ni stability (PdNi/C 50:50 and PdNi/C 60:40). Although other electrocatalysts had similar electrocatalytic activities prior to the stability test over 1000 potential cycles, this one is obviously more resistant to ECSA loss under potential cycling and thus a more promising ORR electrocatalyst in alkaline solution. In the literature, stability tests for PdCu nanodendrites in acidic medium have been discovered [
