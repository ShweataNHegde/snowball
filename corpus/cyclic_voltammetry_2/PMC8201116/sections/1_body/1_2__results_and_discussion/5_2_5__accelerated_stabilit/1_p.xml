<p>To examine the electrochemical stability of the prepared materials, the nanoparticles were electrochemically cycled in 0.1 M NaOH in the presence of Ar gas for a long period of time, that is, 1000 continuous cycling at 0.050 V/s with the potential profile between −0.876 V and + 0.074 V (vs. Hg/HgO/OH
 <sup>−</sup>). The voltammograms (CVs) for Pd/C, PdNi/C 50:50, and homemade Pt/C are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03440-f010">Figure 10</xref>a–c. After long-term stability, PdNi/C 50:50 performed well as active electrocatalyst, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03440-f010">Figure 10</xref>b. Interestingly, the active region of Pd/C and PdNi/C 90:10 increases in the first 250 to 300 cycles and then gradually decreases. It’s possible that this is due to the roughness and cleanliness of the catalyst’s surface [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-03440" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This activity of Pd/C and PdNi/C 90:10 suggests that alkaline solutions help to rearrange the surface of Pd atoms during the cycling process, resulting in more active sites. Similar findings for PdCu porous materials in acidic solution have been published in the literature [

Surprisingly, after 250 potential cycles, the hydrogen adsorption desorption regions of PdNi/C 80:20, PdNi/C 70:30, PdNi/C 60:40, and PdNi/C 50:50 are continuously increased, implying an increase in the electrochemical active area. ORR polarization curves were also tested in the first five cycles and after 1000 cycles of the stability test. According to the ORR results, activity increases after 1000 cycles as the percent of Ni increases, while it decreases for Pd/C and Pt/C. The continuous enhancement of active regions of the CVs may be due to the roughness of the catalyst’s surface, according to these findings. The shift of hydrogen adsorption/desorption regions was used to assess the growth of the catalyst-skin roughness [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-26-03440" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Chun-Hua Cui et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-26-03440" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] published the results for PtNi/C with a description of the dissolution in acidic medium of the second metal, Ni, and how the Pt-Ni surface could adjust for better catalytic performance and build coordinated active surface sites on catalysts. These findings corroborate our findings for PdNi/C in alkaline solution. Similarly, during this long-term stability test, the active area of all materials is continuously increased after the initial 5 to 1000 cycles and raises the active area. On the other hand, there is no such influence on the Pt/C. This impact may be due to the second metal’s surface cleaning and stability, namely Ni. The CV shapes after electrochemical cycling were consistent with what would be anticipated for a Pd-based material in alkaline solution [
