<p>In addition, the electrochemical active area generated by the charge passing through the hydrogen absorption area is complicated by hydrogen absorption into the Pd. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03440-f010">Figure 10</xref>a,c show that Pd/C, PdNi/C 90:10, and Pt/C had low catalytic efficiency and substantial loss of active area after potential cycling, retaining only around 25%, 40%, and 10% of their initial ECSA, respectively. PdNi/C 80:20, PdNi/C 70:30, PdNi/C 60:40, and PdNi/C 50:50, on the other hand, retained and increased the stability of their initial ECSA by 100%, 120%, 150%, and 200%, respectively. This demonstrates that the electrocatalysts with higher Ni percent have better electrochemical stability than Pd/C, PdNi/C 90:10, and Pt/C electrocatalysts, which all have low electrocatalytic activity in alkaline medium.
