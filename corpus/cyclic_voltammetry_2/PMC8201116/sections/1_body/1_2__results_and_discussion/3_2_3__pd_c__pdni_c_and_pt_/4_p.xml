<p>Measured current, kinetic current, and diffusion-limited current are represented by i, ik, and i
 <sub>L</sub>, respectively. To compare the mass and specific area activities of the catalysts, the diffusion-limited current was standardized against and then normalized to the mass and active area of Pd or Pt. PdNi/C 90:10, PdNi/C 80:20, PdNi/C 70:30, PdNi/C 60:40, and PdNi/C 50:50 have computed specific activity of 0.07, 0.11, 0.16, 0.29, and 0.62 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup>, respectively. Specific activity for reference Pd/C and Pt/C electrocatalysts were determined at 0.02 and 0.03 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup>, respectively. ORR was used to calculate the specific activities of all materials, which are listed in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03440-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. On the basis of these estimated values of specific activities, it is determined that all PdNi/C alloys, particularly PdNi/C 50:50, have higher catalytic activities than home-made Pd/C and Pt/C. The presence of Ni accounts for the greater specific activity of the PdNi/C 50:50. When compared to Pd/C and Pt/C, it improves catalytic activity, consequently. Changes in electronic structure caused by the addition of a second metal alter the catalytic activity of PdNi/C. In the literature, hollow Pd

 <sup>1</sup>/C has been shown to improve catalytic activity in an alkaline environment [
