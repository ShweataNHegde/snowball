<p>Several traits emerge during the experimentation process. When compared to Pd/C and Pt/C, the potential region of mixed kinetic diffusion control on PdNi/C is deviated towards higher potentials, indicating that the second metal, Ni, is helping in the most active surface for the ORR in alkaline solution. In terms of hydrogen peroxide production, a lesser quantity is always formed on the PdNi/C (all proportions), whereas the generation of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> detected a bigger amount on the reference Pd/C and homemade Pt/C. In the literature, similar results have been reported for thin Pd films supported on Pt and Pd-based alloys [

 <xref rid="B32-molecules-26-03440" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In addition, all ORR curves had a well-defined diffusion-limiting current region between −0.8 and −0.2 V (vs. Hg/HgO/OH
 <sup>−</sup>) and a mixed kinetic-diffusion control region from −0.2 to 0.05 V (vs. Hg/HgO/OH
 <sup>−</sup>). When compared to the benchmarks Pd/C and Pt/C, the mixed kinetic-diffusion control region is higher for all PdNi/C ratios, especially for the PdNi/C 50:50. In comparison to Pd/C and Pt/C, PdNi/C electrocatalysts (all compositional ratios) enhance ORR activities in alkaline solution.
