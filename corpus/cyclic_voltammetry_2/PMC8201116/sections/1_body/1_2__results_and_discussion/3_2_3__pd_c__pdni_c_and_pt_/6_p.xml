<p>To summarize, ORR polarization curves for Pd/C, Pt/C, and PdNi/C electrocatalysts indicate that the electrochemical reaction is led by kinetic and mixed activation-diffusion control across almost the entire potential range. Increased oxygen transport causes an increase in current as rotation rates increase. Considering the low levels of H
