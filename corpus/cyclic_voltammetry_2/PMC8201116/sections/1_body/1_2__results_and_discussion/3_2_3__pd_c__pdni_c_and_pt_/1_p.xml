 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03440-f006">Figure 6</xref> summarizes the ORR polarization scheme. The ORR experiments were performed in a 0.1 M NaOH medium with a continuous flow of O
 <sub>2</sub> gas. Pd/C and Pt/C have had their polarization curves recorded in various rotations [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-26-03440" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, differing PdNi/C atomic proportions resulted in distinct limiting currents. On the rotating ring disc electrode, Pd/C and PdNi/C show moderate variances in limiting current, however Pt/C has a substantial divergence in limiting current. Furthermore, as the fraction of Ni grows, the potential range of kinetic-diffusion controlled current densities expands. On the ring electrode, hydrogen peroxide is also detected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03440-f006">Figure 6</xref>). Hydrogen peroxide is identified in the potential range of about −0.1 V (vs. Hg/HgO/OH
 <sup>−</sup>) and continues to occur up to −0.826 V. The polarization curves of the Pd/C, PdNi/C, and Pt electrodes were compared at 2500 rpm.
