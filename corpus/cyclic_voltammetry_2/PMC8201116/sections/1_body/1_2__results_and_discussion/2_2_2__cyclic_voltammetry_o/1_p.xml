<p>Electrochemical properties of the electrocatalysts; Pt/C, Pd/C and PdNi/C with its different compositions were studied by cyclic voltammetry in 0.1 M NaOH solution saturated with argon. Initially, four cycles were conducted to clean the surface of the materials using a potential range of −0.876–0.474 V (vs. Hg/HgO/OH
 <sup>−</sup>), and then normal CVs were measured at a scan rate of 0.05 V s
 <sup>−1</sup> in a potential range of −0.876 to 0.074 V (vs. Hg/HgO/OH
 <sup>−</sup>).
