<p>Among the PdNi/C varied proportions, PdNi/C 90:10 had the highest hydrogen adsorption/desorption, while PdNi/C 50:50 had the lowest. The oxides phase is initiated at −0.4 V to −0.1 V (vs. Hg/HgO/OH
 <sup>−</sup>) and the reduction region is between −0.2 V and 0 V (vs. Hg/HgO/OH
 <sup>−</sup>). The presence of a large amount of Pd in PdNi/C 90:10 compared to the other proportions of the PdNi/C causes this behavior of CVs for the PdNi/C at all proportions compared to the Pd/C. It could be owing to lower Pd atomic ratios in PdNi/C alloys, such as PdNi/C 50:50, and the surface of the catalyst engaged in hydrogen adsorption/desorption and alloy oxidation/reduction (formation/reduction of Pd hydroxide and oxyhydroxide). The alloy formation effect, that is, smaller lattice size in PdNi/C 50:50 compared to Pd/C, could explain the lower hydrogen adsorption/desorption charge. CVs have been shown to behave similarly in alkaline medium [
