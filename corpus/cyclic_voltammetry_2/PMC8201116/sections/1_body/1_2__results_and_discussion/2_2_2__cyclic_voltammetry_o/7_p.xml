 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03440-f005">Figure 5</xref> shows that the CV of the hydrogen adsorption/desorption region of Pt/C electrocatalyst is lower than that of Pd/C and PdNi/C electrocatalysts. This is most likely owing to the high concentration of OH
 <sup>−</sup> ions in the alkaline solution. These OH
 <sup>−</sup> ions are deposited on the surface of the Pt/C by adsorption, inhibiting the hydrogen adsorption active sites. As a result, among all the prepared materials, Pt/C had the lowest hydrogen adsorption/desorption region [
