<p>Furthermore, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03440-f005">Figure 5</xref>, the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of PdNi/C electrocatalysts were identical to that of Pd/C in Ar-saturated alkaline media, that is, 0.1 M NaOH solution. Pt/C, on the other hand, has a distinct behavior when compared to other materials. Literature [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-03440" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] has published similar CVs of Pt and Pd supported on graphene sheets. However, two peaks can be seen in the hydrogen adsorption/desorption region (P1 and P2). This suggests that the peaks P1 and P2 for Ni-containing catalysts may be changed positively or negatively, and that this change may be linked to the interference of nickel oxide formation [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-03440" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. As the Ni content increases, there is a small shift to lower positive values of the onset potential of the oxides formation in the potential range of about −0.426 to 0.074 V (vs. Hg/HgO/OH
 <sup>−</sup>), as documented in literature. In comparison to Pd/C and Pt/C, the charge involved in the hydrogen adsorption/desorption region (approximately −0.876 V–0.500 V vs. Hg/HgO/OH
 <sup>−</sup>) varies among the different composition of PdNi/C electrocatalysts.
