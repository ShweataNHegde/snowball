<p>In alkaline solution, different processes were observed in CVs. The Pd/C curve on the positive scan reveals three current peaks linked to different electrochemical processes occurring on the catalyst surface. Peaks P1 and P2, with potential ranging from −0.876 to −0.576 V (vs. Hg/HgO/OH
 <sup>−</sup>), may be attributed to the oxidation of hydrogen adsorbed (and absorbed) as shown in Equation (7).
