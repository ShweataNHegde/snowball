<p>It is typical to express mass activity as kinetic current at any given potential normalized by the mass of the catalytic metal for electrodes other than functional cathodes. In the case of PdNi atomic ratios, mass activity was determined by dividing the ORR kinetic current at 0.85 V by the mass of Pd, while in the case of Pt mass activity, Pt mass was used (

Clearly, the molar ratio of the two metals influences the mass activities of the PdNi/C electrocatalysts. This sort of normalization indicates the economic relevance of the prepared PdNi/C catalysts because the catalyst’s performance is also quantified in terms of kW/$ [

 <xref rid="B40-molecules-26-03440" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], is another effective technique to compare activity. The current per unit area, which is a genuine physicochemical parameter, is obtained using this method of normalization. PdNi/C 50:50 has the highest specific activity, which is more than six times that of Pd/C and more than seven times that of home-made Pt/C, according to ECSA-normalized currents (
