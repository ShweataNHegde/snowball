<p>Finally, the estimates revealed that the ORR process uses roughly four electrons, except in the case of Pt/C. This behavior of PdNi/C electrocatalysts reveals that hydrogen peroxide production is reduced at about 4 electrons mechanism. The large creation of hydrogen peroxides at Pt/C is due to the fact that the ORR in alkaline occurs via two-electron pathway [
