<p>For ORR in 0.1M NaOH, Tafel plots of the mass transport corrected currents (ik) were generated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03440-f009">Figure 9</xref>). Pd/C, Pt/C, and PdNi/C electrocatalysts have two distinct areas with corresponding two values of the Tafel slopes. Equation (12) was used to determine the kinetic currents (ik). When comparing the kinetic current densities at −0.076 V (vs. Hg/HgO/OH
 <sup>−</sup>), the PdNi/C (all compositions) appear to be significantly more active for the ORR than the Pd/C and Pt/C, indicating an activity improvement. In addition, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03440-f009">Figure 9</xref>, there is a linear relationship between log ik and the applied potential (E/V) for all materials. 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03440-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> shows the Tafel slopes, which were recorded in the applied potential region of mixed kinetic-diffusion control for prepared materials. The slopes were found between (57 mV dec
 <sup>−1</sup>, 62 mV dec
 <sup>−1</sup>) and (119 mV dec
 <sup>−1</sup>, 120 mV dec
 <sup>−1</sup>) in low and high overpotential ranges, respectively. The adsorbed ion (OH
 <sup>−</sup>) may be responsible for a small deviation in Tafel slopes for Pd/C, Pt/C, and PdNi/C 90:10 at low overpotential [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-26-03440" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In principle, the tangent at each point has a different slope. However, at a rotation rate of 2500 rpm, the observation yields values in the possible region of 0.850 V &lt; E &lt; 0.985 V (vs. Hg/HgO/OH
 <sup>−</sup>) for a rough estimate of the range of the Tafel slopes.
