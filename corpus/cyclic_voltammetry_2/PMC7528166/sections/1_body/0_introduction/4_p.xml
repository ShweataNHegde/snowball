<p>As a first step toward this direction, we chose spinach to conduct proof-of-principle studies because spinach contains appreciable amounts of N and Fe, among other elements such as S and P,

 </sup> which are important elements for carbon-based ORR catalysts. We found that by using spinach as the precursor, melamine as a nitrogen promoter, and NaCl/KCl as the pore producer, multielement-doped carbon with high ORR activity can be obtained through pyrolysis at 900 °C under Ar. The resultant carbon materials have a sheet-like structure with a specific area of 289.6 m

 <sup>–1</sup> and a high density of active sites for ORR, as demonstrated by the high oxygen reduction current peak in the cyclic voltammograms. The polarization measurements further show that the obtained carbon sheets have ORR performance superior to Pt/C in alkaline solutions in terms of half-wave potential, methanol tolerance, and long-term stability. They are also active ORR catalysts in acidic media. The Fe–N

 </sub> moiety is the main active center, as supported by the results from the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements and the acid etching studies, as well as from the observations of poisoning effects of cyanide and fluoride. Control experiments revealed that the presence of micro- and mesopores and the sufficiently high density of Fe–N
