<p>Electrochemical energy conversion and storage play a key role in sustainable and clean energy production. Among different electrochemical devices, fuel cells and metal–air batteries show great promises. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the cathode reaction of these devices and is one of the bottlenecks of their practical applications because of its sluggish kinetics that limits their power output. Platinum-based carbon-supported catalysts have long been recognized as the most effective electrocatalysts for ORR. However, the scarcity and high cost of Pt, together with the lack of long-term stability and the vulnerability to surface poisoning by various chemicals such as methanol and carbon monoxide, call for the development of non-Pt group metal (NPGM) catalysts. To address these issues, carbon-based catalysts have attracted increasing attention because of their excellent stability, resistance to surface poisoning, and use of low-cost and earth-abundant elements. A variety of NPGM catalysts have been developed by doping carbon with various heteroatoms such as N, S, P, B, or co-doping with N and Fe, or N and Co.

 </sup> Among them, iron- and nitrogen-co-doped carbon materials exhibited the best performance for ORR, and some of these catalysts showed key performance descriptors that are superior to Pt catalysts.
