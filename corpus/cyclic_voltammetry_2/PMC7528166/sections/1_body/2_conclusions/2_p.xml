<p>We have developed an effective synthetic strategy to fabricate spinach-derived heteroatom-doped porous carbon sheets. These materials exhibit ORR performance superior to Pt/C in alkaline media in terms of half-wave and onset potentials, longtime, stability and resistance to methanol poisoning. They also show ORR activity close to that of Pt/C in acidic media. The control experiments reveal the active centers as Feâ€“N

 </sub> moieties and the important roles of micro- and mesopores. Given that many plants have the ability to accumulate metals, we envision that they can be used not only for metal remediation from contaminated environments but also as a natural precursor for the preparation of heteroatom-doped carbon materials as catalysts for various reactions and electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage.
