<p>The electrochemical measurements were carried out on a CHI700C electrochemical workstation (CH instruments Inc.) with a three-electrode two-compartment glass cell at room temperature. A platinum wire and an Ag/AgCl (1 M KCl) electrode were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. A RRDE with a glassy carbon disk (5.0 mm in diameter) surrounded by a platinum ring (with a collection efficiency of 20%) served as the working electrode. The working electrode was placed in the main compartment of the electrochemical cell that is separated from the compartment housing the counter and reference electrodes by a fine glass frit to minimize contaminations. To prepare the catalyst ink, 2 mg of the carbon sample was ultrasonically dispersed in 1.0 mL of a 7:3 (v/v) ethanol/water mixture solvent along with 20 μL of Nafion solution (5%) for 30 min. Then, 15 μL of the catalyst ink was dropped onto the glassy carbon disk and dried at room temperature for 30 min at a catalyst loading of 0.15 mg cm
 <sup>–2</sup>. For comparison, commercial Pt/C was loaded onto the glassy carbon electrode surface using the same procedure and catalyst loading. The RRDE tests were carried out in N
