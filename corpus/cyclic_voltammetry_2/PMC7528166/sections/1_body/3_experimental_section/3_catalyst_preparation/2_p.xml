<p>The spinach leaves were washed with water and ground into juice using a kitchen blender. The juice was freeze-dried for 48 h with a Labconco FreeZone freeze-dryer and ground into powder with a mortar and pestle. A 0.50 g of the obtained spinach powder, 0.50 g melamine, 3.0 g KCl, 3.0 g NaCl, and 20.0 mL deionized water were added into a beaker and mixed with magnetic stirring. The beaker was covered with a parafilm, and the mixture was stirred and heated to 120 °C until a uniform mixture was formed. The resulting mixture was quickly transferred to centrifuge tubes and frozen with liquid nitrogen and then freeze-dried for 48 h. The samples were then collected and ground into fine powders. Subsequently, the composite powders were pyrolyzed in an Ar atmosphere according to the following heating program: (1) at 500 °C for 2 h at a ramp rate of 5 °C min
 <sup>–1</sup> to dehydrate and carbonize the composite powders; (2) at 900 °C for 2 h to further carbonize and graphitize the material. Finally, the obtained sample was soaked in 0.5 M H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> at 85 °C for 24 h to remove metallic particles, followed by filtration with water and freeze-drying for 24 h. The freeze-dried sample was calcined at 900 °C for 1 h in Ar flow. The obtained sample is denoted as M
 <sup>+</sup>S
 <sup>+</sup>C900-900, where M and S represent melamine and salt, respectively, and the presence or absence of melamine and salt is presented with “+” and “–”. The first “900” indicates the first pyrolysis temperature and the second “900” denotes the second pyrolysis temperature. Similar notation method is used for control samples, as noted in the text.
