<p>SEM observation was performed on a field emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S-4800). High-resolution TEM images were obtained using a JEOL-2100F microscope operated under an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. XRD data were collected at room temperature using a Bruker D8 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1541 nm). Raman spectra were recorded on a confocal LabRAM HR800 spectrometer (Horiba) with an excitation wavelength of 514.5 nm from an argon ion laser. N
 <sub>2</sub> adsorption–desorption isotherms and PSD were obtained at 77 K using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 Plus instrument. The specific surface areas of the samples were calculated using the BET method. The PSD was calculated via the DFT model. XPS measurements were conducted on a PHI X-tool instrument with Al Kα radiation.
