<p>To probe the nature of the ORR catalytic active sites, we measured the ORR activity of M
 <sup>+</sup>S
 <sup>+</sup>C900-900 in 0.1 M KOH containing 10 mM KCN. As can be seen in 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>
 </xref>a, the addition of KCN negatively shifts the onset and half-wave potentials by ∼73 and ∼79 mV, respectively. In addition, the diffusion-limited current decreased 6% at +0.4 V. These observations indicate that the iron centers are the active sites, and the decreased activity is attributed to the strong binding of CN
 <sup>–</sup> ions to the iron centers.

 </sup> This assertion is further confirmed by the 41 mV negative shift of

 <sub>1/2</sub> after the addition of 5 mM of NaF to O
 <sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1 M KOH (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>
 </xref>b). The decrease of ORR activity by these anions has been attributed to their high affinity to the iron centers that compete with O
 <sub>2</sub> binding to these sites.

 </sup> This hypothesis cannot explain the observation of the minute decrease of diffusion-limited current accompanied with the tens of millivolts negative shift of

 </sup> Recent Mössbauer spectroscopic and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopic studies by Mukerjee and others revealed that the active site for Fe–N–C catalysts is an Fe

 <sub>4</sub> moiety that is formed by the reduction of Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>–N
 <sub>4</sub>.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref65">65</xref>,

 </sup> Therefore, the ORR activity in terms of 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>1/2</sub> is dictated by the Fe
 <sup>2+/3+</sup> redox potential. This active site model is consistent with the earlier studies of Fe and Co porphyrins by Anson and co-workers

 </sup> and can reconcile the large negative shift of 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>1/2</sub> and the small decrease of the limiting current. Thus, the negative 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>1/2</sub> arises from the much larger binding constant of these anions to Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> than to Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>, as has been shown extensively in iron porphyrins and hemes,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref69">69</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref70">70</xref>
 </sup> and thereby the formation of the ORR active center Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>–N
 <sub>4</sub> is shifted to more negative potentials. The small decrease of the limiting current can be accounted for by the competitive binding of these anions and O
 <sub>2</sub> to the Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>–N
 <sub>4</sub> center. The critical role of Fe species in the high ORR activity was further demonstrated by the chemical etching of M
 <sup>+</sup>S
 <sup>+</sup>C900-900 with 12 M HCl. The ORR activity of M
 <sup>+</sup>S
 <sup>+</sup>C900-900 diminished markedly after the etching, with an 81 mV negative shift of the onset potential and a 17% decrease of the limiting current (

These results clearly indicate that the Fe species play an indispensable role in the high ORR activity of M

 <sup>+</sup>C900-900 and provide additional support for the hypothesis of the Fe
