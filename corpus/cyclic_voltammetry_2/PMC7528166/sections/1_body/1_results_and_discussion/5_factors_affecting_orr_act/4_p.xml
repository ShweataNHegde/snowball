<p>Control experiments were also performed to reveal the roles of NaCl/KCl and melamine in forming the high-performance spinach-derived carbon materials. From the ORR polarization curves shown in

 <sup>+</sup>S
 <sup>+</sup>C900-900, but in the absence of NaCl/KCl and melamine (M
 <sup>–</sup>S
 <sup>–</sup>C900-900), the onset potential was significantly shifted to a negative potential at +0.84 V, and the limiting current was reduced to half of that observed on M
 <sup>+</sup>S
 <sup>+</sup>C900-900. The sample prepared with the addition of melamine, but no NaCl/KCl, to spinach showed slightly improved ORR onset potential and limiting current (M
 <sup>+</sup>S
 <sup>–</sup>C900-900). Adding NaCl/KCl mixture to spinach in the absence of melamine (M
 <sup>–</sup>S
 <sup>+</sup>C900-900) further increased the ORR limiting current. These performance differences can be understood in terms of surface area, pore formation, and nitrogen content in the samples. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms clearly reveal that NaCl/KCl crystals play a major role in forming mesopores and increasing the surface area (

 <sup>–</sup>C900-900 is only 40.3 m

 <sup>2</sup> g
 <sup>–1</sup> with a pore volume of 0.70 cm
 <sup>3</sup> g
 <sup>–1</sup> (M
 <sup>–</sup>S
 <sup>+</sup>C900-900). Most pores are mesopores. Chen and co-workers have shown that NaCl can facilitate the formation of mesopores and act as a template to form macropores.

The surface area of M
 <sup>+</sup>S
 <sup>–</sup>C900-900 is more than 60% higher than that of M
 <sup>–</sup>S
 <sup>–</sup>C900-900. Similarly, the surface area of M
 <sup>+</sup>S
 <sup>+</sup>C900-900 is about 65% higher than that of M
 <sup>–</sup>S
 <sup>+</sup>C900-900. The only difference in the two pairs is the absence of melamine in M
 <sup>–</sup>S
 <sup>–</sup>C900-900 and M
 <sup>–</sup>S
 <sup>+</sup>C900-900. Accompanied with the increasing surface area is the pore volume. The micropore and mesopore areas increased significantly after the addition of melamine. These structural changes most likely arise from the formation of volatile compounds in melamine decomposition.
