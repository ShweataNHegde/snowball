<p>To aid in dissecting how different factors in the synthesis procedure contribute to the high performance of the obtained carbon-based catalysts, various controlled experiments were performed. The influence of the pyrolysis temperature on the electrocatalytic properties was first explored. As shown in

 </xref>a, the ORR activity for the catalysts prepared under the same protocol (first heat treatment followed by an acid wash and second heat treatment) but with different pyrolysis temperatures (800 °C for M
 <sup>+</sup>S
 <sup>+</sup>C800-800 and 1000 °C for M
 <sup>+</sup>S
 <sup>+</sup>C1000-1000) is significantly inferior to that of M
 <sup>+</sup>S
 <sup>+</sup>C900-900, which displays more negative half-wave potentials and lower limiting current densities. The higher activity of M
 <sup>+</sup>S
 <sup>+</sup>C900-900 can at least partly be attributed to its higher surface area and pore volume (see

In addition, the variation of chemical speciation at different temperatures can strongly influence the catalyst activity. As disclosed by the XPS measurements, the percentage of the overall N and O contents decreased with the increasing pyrolysis temperature, whereas the Fe and C contents increased (

 </sup> Further inspection of the high-resolution N 1s XPS spectrum revealed that catalysts prepared at 900 °C have the highest percentage of graphitic and Fe–N species (

As discussed above, the Fe–N species is the most active site in NPGM catalysts. This result adds an explanation for the optimal pyrolysis temperature at 900 °C.
