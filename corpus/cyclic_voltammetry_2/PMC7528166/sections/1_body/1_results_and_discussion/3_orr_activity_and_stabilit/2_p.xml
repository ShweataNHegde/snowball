<p>To test the ORR performance of M
 <sup>+</sup>S
 <sup>+</sup>C900-900, cyclic voltammograms were first recorded in 0.1 M KOH saturated with N
 <sub>2</sub> and O
 <sub>2</sub>, respectively (

 </xref>a). The current was normalized to the geometric area of the glassy carbon supporting electrode. A quasi-rectangular voltammogram was observed in N
 <sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1 M KOH, which suggests that only capacitive charging current was present. In contrast, when the solution was saturated with O
 <sub>2</sub>, a very strong reduction peak appeared at +0.88 V, indicating the effective electrochemical reduction of oxygen. The high magnitude of the O
 <sub>2</sub> reduction peak current density at a relatively low scan rate (10 mV s
 <sup>â€“1</sup>) suggests the existence of abundant accessible active sites on the catalyst. Rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) measurements were carried out to gain further insights into the ORR performances of M
 <sup>+</sup>S
 <sup>+</sup>C900-900. A representative result is shown in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref>b along with that from a commercial Pt/C (20 wt % Pt) of the same mass loading as a benchmark. For clarity, only the disk current density is shown. Clearly, M
 <sup>+</sup>S
 <sup>+</sup>C900-900 exhibited a much higher ORR activity than Pt/C. Thus, M
 <sup>+</sup>S
 <sup>+</sup>C900-900 has a half-wave potential (
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>1/2</sub>) of +0.88 V, which is 20 mV more positive than that of Pt/C, whereas the two catalysts have a similar ORR onset potential (

 <sub>o</sub>). Similar ORR activities were also obtained on carbon materials derived from spinach purchased from different supermarkets (

Compared with other NPGM ORR catalysts, including those derived from biomass, M
 <sup>+</sup>S
 <sup>+</sup>C900-900 is the most active, especially after the differences in surface area and catalyst loading are considered (

 <sub>1/2</sub> of +0.86 V, and the same was observed on lysine-derived nitrogen-doped carbon hollow cubes.

 </sup> These values are 20 mV more negative than that of M
 <sup>+</sup>S
 <sup>+</sup>C900-900. As mentioned in the outset, a variety of biomass have been used as sources for preparing carbon-based ORR catalysts.

 </sup> One advantage of spinach is that it naturally contains a high amount of Fe, which has been extensively demonstrated to be an important component of ORR active sites.

 </sup> In the present case, no additional Fe source was used in preparing the carbon nanosheets, unlike okara- and catkin-derived carbons where FeCl
 <sub>3</sub> was used to increase the Fe content.
