<p>Selectivity and durability of the catalysts are important performance metrics for their practical applications. To investigate the methanol crossover effects, chronoamperometric responses (
 <italic>i</italic>â€“
 <italic>t</italic> curves) were recorded in O
 <sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1 M KOH at +0.88 V with the addition of methanol into the electrolyte solution to make up a 1 M methanol solution. As shown in

 </xref>a, M
 <sup>+</sup>S
 <sup>+</sup>C900-900 is insensitive to methanol, indicating the excellent selectivity to ORR over methanol oxidation, whereas Pt/C shows a high methanol oxidation current, as indicated by the appearance of a large oxidation current (opposite to the ORR current) after the addition of methanol. The durability of M
 <sup>+</sup>S
 <sup>+</sup>C900-900 and Pt/C was also evaluated and compared by chronoamperometric measurements, with an electrode rotation speed of 900 rpm in O
 <sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1 M KOH. As depicted in

 </xref>b, the resultant chronoamperometric profile for M
 <sup>+</sup>S
 <sup>+</sup>C900-900 exhibited a nearly invariant current response after the initial 15% drop within the first hour. The current remained at 83% of the initial value even after 10 h of continuous operation. In stark contrast, the activity of Pt/C kept decreasing, and only 57% of the initial current remained after 10 h under the same experimental conditions. The result indicated a markedly higher stability of M
 <sup>+</sup>S
 <sup>+</sup>C900-900 than the commercial Pt/C catalyst in the alkaline solution. M
 <sup>+</sup>S
 <sup>+</sup>C900-900 also exhibited a remarkable long-term stability. The RDE measurements showed almost no change of limiting current and half-wave potential after the M
 <sup>+</sup>S
 <sup>+</sup>C900-900 modified electrode was immersed in the electrolyte for 2 months (

 </xref>c). In contrast, the commercial Pt/C displayed a 44 mV negative shift of the half-wave potential in the same period (
