<p>The high ORR activity of M
 <sup>+</sup>S
 <sup>+</sup>C900-900 was further demonstrated by the number of electron transfer (

 <sup>–</sup> percent yield involved in ORR. The

 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>–</sup> percent yield at different potentials were calculated by using

 </xref>c, for M
 <sup>+</sup>S
 <sup>+</sup>C900-900, the average

To further examine the ORR activity, we also performed RRDE measurements at various rotation speeds from 400 to 2500 rpm. As expected from the K–L equation (
 <xref rid="eq1" ref-type="disp-formula">eq 
  <xref rid="eq1" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref>
 </xref>), the limiting current density increased with the increasing rotation speed (

  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref>d). The corresponding K–L plots (

 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref>e. The K–L plots from +0.61 to +0.81 V display good linearity with a similar slope, indicating the first-order reaction kinetics for ORR with respect to the dissolved oxygen concentration. To shed light on the mechanism of the ORR on M
 <sup>+</sup>S
 <sup>+</sup>C900-900, Tafel analysis was performed. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref>f, the Tafel slope for M
 <sup>+</sup>S
 <sup>+</sup>C900-900 is 61.5 mV dec
 <sup>–1</sup>, which is lower than that for Pt/C of 63.1 mV dec
 <sup>–1</sup>. These values are close to the theoretical value of 60 mV dec
 <sup>–1</sup> when the transfer of the first electron is the rate-determining step in the ORR process.
