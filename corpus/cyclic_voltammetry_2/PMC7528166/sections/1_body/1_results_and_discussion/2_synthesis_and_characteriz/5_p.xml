<p>XPS measurements were employed to characterize the chemical states of different elements in M

 <sup>+</sup>C900-900. As shown in

 </xref>e, the full survey XPS spectrum reveals that M
 <sup>+</sup>S
 <sup>+</sup>C900-900 is mainly composed of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen and trace amounts of iron, sulfur, and phosphorus. The atomic percentage of each element is summarized in

 </xref>f–i. The C 1s spectrum can be resolved into four peaks at the binding energies of 284.5, 285.6, 286.5, and 289.0 eV (

 </xref>h, the high-resolution S 2p XPS spectrum can be deconvoluted into several peaks. The two peaks at binding energies of around 162.0 and 163.0 eV can be attributed to the spin–orbit coupling of S 2p
 <sub>3/2</sub> and S 2p
 <sub>1/2</sub> for thiol sulfurs.

 </sup> Following these previous reports, we assign the 710.6 and 723.0 eV peaks to Fe 2p
 <sub>3/2</sub> and Fe 2p

 <sub>3/2</sub> and Fe 2p
 <sub>1/2</sub> of an Fe(III) species. The peak at 716.8 eV is identified as a satellite peak corresponding to Fe 2p
