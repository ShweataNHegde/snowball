 <sup>+</sup>S
 <sup>+</sup>C900-900 consists of agglomerates of graphene-like carbon sheets with wrinkles and defects. There are many voids created by the dissolution of NaCl/KCl salt crystals. These macropores provide passages for transporting the reactants to active sites, which are beneficial for improving the catalytic activity (vide infra). The high-magnification TEM image in

  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>e demonstrates that M
 <sup>+</sup>S
 <sup>+</sup>C900-900 has crystalline domains with a lattice distance of about 0.36 nm, corresponding to the (002) direction of the graphitic carbon lattice. The corresponding selected-area electron diffraction pattern (the inset in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>e) exhibits a sixfold symmetry, confirming that M
 <sup>+</sup>S
 <sup>+</sup>C900-900 has a graphite-like structure.
