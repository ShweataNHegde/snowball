 <sup>+</sup>C900-900. The two main peaks at around 25.0 and 44.1° can be assigned to the (002) and (101) planes of graphite (JCPDS card no. 41-1487), respectively,

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>
 </sup> which indicate that graphite-like structures were formed after the high-temperature pyrolysis. This result is in good agreement with the TEM observations. To further characterize the structure of M
 <sup>+</sup>S
 <sup>+</sup>C900-900, a Raman spectrum was recorded. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure

 </xref>b, two relatively strong peaks were observed at 1332 and 1590 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>, which can be assigned to the D and G bands, respectively.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>
 </sup> The G band arises from the Raman-active in-plane bond-stretching of the sp
 <sup>2</sup> carbon atoms and has an 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>2g</sub> symmetry. The D band is attributed to the ring breathing mode of 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>1g</sub> symmetry. This mode is Raman-inactive in perfect graphite and graphene but becomes active in defective graphite and graphene.

 </sup> The observation of these Raman peaks suggests the formation of defective graphite structure after pyrolysis, which is further confirmed by the appearance of a weak broad band centered at 2725 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>, assignable to the overtone of the D band.

 <sub>0</sub> = 0.45 to 1.0 signals the existence of narrow slit-like pores, large mesopores in a matrix with much smaller pores, and pores of irregular shape and broad size distribution.
