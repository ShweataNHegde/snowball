 </xref>. Fresh spinach leaves were first cleaned and blended into juice, which was then freeze-dried and ground into a fine powder. Afterward, the spinach powder, melamine, NaCl, and KCl were dissolved and mixed in water and heated to 120 °C to form a uniform mixture. An elevated temperature is needed to dissolve melamine because of its relatively low solubility at room temperature.

 </sup> The mixture was then cooled down quickly in liquid nitrogen and freeze-dried to obtain spinach–salt–melamine composites. During this process, the uniformity of the mixture was preserved. The composites were then pyrolyzed at high temperatures, and the metal particles were leached out by soaking in a heated sulfuric acid solution. Finally, the obtained carbon powder was pyrolyzed again at 900 °C for 1 h and denoted as M
 <sup>+</sup>S
 <sup>+</sup>C900-900.
