Therefore, this work suggests the use of concentrated glyme-based electrolytes, the fine-tuning of the operative conditions, and the careful selection of active materials chemistry as significant steps to achieve practical and safe lithium-metal batteries.", "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8279017?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Energy & fuels : an American Chemical Society journal", "authorinfo": ["Marangon V", "Minnetti L", "Adami M", "Barlini A", "Hassoun J"], "title": "Lithium-Metal Batteries Using Sustainable Electrolyte Media and Various Cathode Chemistries."}, "PMC8201116": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "34198921", "source": "MED", "pmid": "34198921", "pmcid": "PMC8201116", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC8201116"}, "doi": "10.3390/molecules26113440", "title": "Synthesis and Characterizations of PdNi Carbon Supported Nanomaterials: Studies of Electrocatalytic Activity for Oxygen Reduction in Alkaline Medium.", "authorString": "Khan MS, Khattak R, Khan A, Chen Q, Nisar J, Iqbal Z, Rashid A, Kamran AW, Zekker I, Zahoor M, Alzahrani KJ, Batiha GE.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Khan MS", "firstName": "Muhammad Sufaid", "lastName": "Khan", "initials": "MS", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-9340-8683"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Malakand, Chakdara 18800, Pakistan."}}}, {"fullName": "Khattak R", "firstName": "Rozina", "lastName": "Khattak", "initials": "R", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Women University, Peshawar 25000, Pakistan."}}}, {"fullName": "Khan A", "firstName": "Abbas", "lastName": "Khan", "initials": "A", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Abdul Wali Khan University, Mardan 23200, Pakistan."}}}, {"fullName": "Chen Q", "firstName": "Qiuling", "lastName": "Chen", "initials": "Q", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Material Science and Engineering Department, Henan University of Technology, LianhuaRoad 100, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Nisar J", "firstName": "Jan", "lastName": "Nisar", "initials": "J", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "National Centre of Excellence in Physical Chemistry, University of Peshawar, Peshawar 25120, Pakistan."}}}, {"fullName": "Iqbal Z", "firstName": "Zahoor", "lastName": "Iqbal", "initials": "Z", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-4355-3647"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Malakand, Chakdara 18800, Pakistan."}}}, {"fullName": "Rashid A", "firstName": "Abdur", "lastName": "Rashid", "initials": "A", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Hydrogeochemistry Laboratory, Department of Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad 45320, Pakistan."}}}, {"fullName": "Kamran AW", "firstName": "Abdul Waheed", "lastName": "Kamran", "initials": "AW", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Malakand, Chakdara 18800, Pakistan."}}}, {"fullName": "Zekker I", "firstName": "Ivar", "lastName": "Zekker", "initials": "I", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Institute of Chemistry, University of Tartu, 50090 Tartu, Estonia."}}}, {"fullName": "Zahoor M", "firstName": "Muhammad", "lastName": "Zahoor", "initials": "M", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-4528-8517"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Malakand, Chakdara 18800, Pakistan."}}}, {"fullName": "Alzahrani KJ", "firstName": "Khalid J", "lastName": "Alzahrani", "initials": "KJ", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-6688-0106"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Clinical Laboratories Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Taif University, P.O.

Supercapacitors comprising AC electrodes coated with 20 cycles of ALD ZnO at 70 \u00b0C and operated in TEABF<sub>4</sub>/acetonitrile organic electrolyte show a specific capacitance of 23.13 F g<sup>-1</sup> at 5 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and enhanced capacitance retention at 3.2 V, which well exceeds the normal working voltage of a commercial EDLC product (2.7 V). This work delivers an additional feasible approach of using ZnO ALD modification of AC materials, enhancing and promoting stable EDLC cells under high working voltages.", "Keywords": ["High voltage", "Zinc oxide", "Atomic Layer Deposition", "Supercapacitors", "Porous Activated Carbon"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8306591?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)", "authorinfo": ["Wu C", "Zhang F", "Xiao X", "Chen J", "Sun J", "Gandla D", "Ein-Eli Y", "Tan DQ"], "title": "Enhanced Electrochemical Performance of Supercapacitors via Atomic Layer Deposition of ZnO on the Activated Carbon Electrode Material."}, "PMC8270343": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "34202753", "source": "MED", "pmid": "34202753", "pmcid": "PMC8270343", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC8270343"}, "doi": "10.3390/molecules26133858", "title": "Eco-Friendly Nitrogen-Doped Graphene Preparation and Design for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction.", "authorString": "Dan M, Vulcu A, Porav SA, Leostean C, Borodi G, Cadar O, Berghian-Grosan C.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Dan M", "firstName": "Monica", "lastName": "Dan", "initials": "M", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "National Institute for Research and Development of Isotopic and Molecular Technologies, 67-103 Donat Street, 400293 Cluj-Napoca, Romania."}}}, {"fullName": "Vulcu A", "firstName": "Adriana", "lastName": "Vulcu", "initials": "A", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-9202-0575"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "National Institute for Research and Development of Isotopic and Molecular Technologies, 67-103 Donat Street, 400293 Cluj-Napoca, Romania."}}}, {"fullName": "Porav SA", "firstName": "Sebastian A", "lastName": "Porav", "initials": "SA", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "National Institute for Research and Development of Isotopic and Molecular Technologies, 67-103 Donat Street, 400293 Cluj-Napoca, Romania."}}}, {"fullName": "Leostean C", "firstName": "Cristian", "lastName": "Leostean", "initials": "C", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "National Institute for Research and Development of Isotopic and Molecular Technologies, 67-103 Donat Street, 400293 Cluj-Napoca, Romania."}}}, {"fullName": "Borodi G", "firstName": "Gheorghe", "lastName": "Borodi", "initials": "G", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "National Institute for Research and Development of Isotopic and Molecular Technologies, 67-103 Donat Street, 400293 Cluj-Napoca, Romania."}}}, {"fullName": "Cadar O", "firstName": "Oana", "lastName": "Cadar", "initials": "O", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-0879-9211"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "INCDO-INOE 2000, Research Institute for Analytical Instrumentation, 67 Donat Street, 400293 Cluj-Napoca, Romania."}}}, {"fullName": "Berghian-Grosan C", "firstName": "Camelia", "lastName": "Berghian-Grosan", "initials": "C", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-5885-3132"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "National Institute for Research and Development of Isotopic and Molecular Technologies, 67-103 Donat Street, 400293 Cluj-Napoca, Romania."}}}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": [{"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-9202-0575"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-0879-9211"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-5885-3132"}]}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "13", "volume": "26", "journalIssueId": "3195509", "dateOfPublication": "2021 Jun", "monthOfPublication": "6", "yearOfPublication": "2021", "printPublicationDate": "2021-06-01", "journal": {"title": "Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)", "ISOAbbreviation": "Molecules", "medlineAbbreviation": "Molecules", "NLMid": "100964009", "ISSN": "1420-3049", "ESSN": "1420-3049"}}, "pubYear": "2021", "abstractText": "Four N-doped graphene materials with a nitrogen content ranging from 8.34 to 13.1 wt.% are prepared by the ball milling method.

applications. To date, however, it has not been tested whether the combination of graphene and DESs can yield synergistic effects in electrochemistry. We therefore study the electrochemical behavior of a defined graphene monolayer of centimeter-scale, which was produced by chemical vapor deposition and transferred onto insulating SiO2/Si supports, in the common DES choline chloride/ethylene glycol (12CE) under typical electrochemical conditions. We measure the graphene potential window in 12CE and estimate the apparent electron transfer kinetics of an outer-sphere redox couple.

These results suggest that hydrogen-bonded quinone anions can function in an analogous co-electrocatalytic manner to H<sub>2</sub>Q.", "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8293985?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Chemical science", "authorinfo": ["Hooe SL", "Cook EN", "Reid AG", "Machan CW"], "title": "Non-covalent assembly of proton donors and <i>p-</i>benzoquinone anions for co-electrocatalytic reduction of dioxygen."}, "PMC7820460": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "33479478", "source": "MED", "pmid": "33479478", "pmcid": "PMC7820460", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC7820460"}, "doi": "10.1038/s41598-021-81769-5", "title": "N-doped graphene foam obtained by microwave-assisted exfoliation of graphite.", "authorString": "Skorupska M, Ilnicka A, Lukaszewicz JP.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Skorupska M", "firstName": "Malgorzata", "lastName": "Skorupska", "initials": "M", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Faculty of Chemistry, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Gagarina 7, 87-100, Torun, Poland."}}}, {"fullName": "Ilnicka A", "firstName": "Anna", "lastName": "Ilnicka", "initials": "A", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Faculty of Chemistry, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Gagarina 7, 87-100, Torun, Poland. ailnicka@umk.pl."}}}, {"fullName": "Lukaszewicz JP", "firstName": "Jerzy P", "lastName": "Lukaszewicz", "initials": "JP", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": [{"affiliation": "Faculty of Chemistry, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Gagarina 7, 87-100, Torun, Poland."}, {"affiliation": "Centre for Modern Interdisciplinary Technologies, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Wilenska 4, 87-100, Torun, Poland."}]}}]}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "1", "volume": "11", "journalIssueId": "3084089", "dateOfPublication": "2021 Jan", "monthOfPublication": "1", "yearOfPublication": "2021", "printPublicationDate": "2021-01-01", "journal": {"title": "Scientific reports", "ISOAbbreviation": "Sci Rep", "medlineAbbreviation": "Sci Rep", "NLMid": "101563288", "ISSN": "2045-2322", "ESSN": "2045-2322"}}, "pubYear": "2021", "pageInfo": "2044", "abstractText": "The synthesis of metal-free but electrochemically active electrode materials, which could be an important contributor to environmental protection, is the key motivation for this research approach.

However, the further development of ZIBs is impeded by two main challenges: Currently reported cathode materials usually suffer from rapid capacity fading or high toxicity, and meanwhile, unstable zinc stripping/plating on Zn anode seriously shortens the cycling life of ZIBs. In this paper, metal-organic framework (MOF) materials are proposed to simultaneously address these issues and realize high-performance ZIBs with Mn(BTC) MOF cathodes and ZIF-8-coated Zn (ZIF-8@Zn) anodes. Various MOF materials were synthesized, and Mn(BTC) MOF was found to exhibit the best Zn<sup>2+</sup>-storage ability with a capacity of 112\u00a0mAh\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup>. Zn<sup>2+</sup> storage mechanism of the Mn(BTC) was carefully studied. Besides, ZIF-8@Zn anodes were prepared by coating ZIF-8 MOF material on Zn foils. Unique porous structure of the ZIF-8 coating guided uniform Zn stripping/plating on the surface of Zn anodes.

However, the further development of ZIBs is impeded by two main challenges: Currently reported cathode materials usually suffer from rapid capacity fading or high toxicity, and meanwhile, unstable zinc stripping/plating on Zn anode seriously shortens the cycling life of ZIBs. In this paper, metal-organic framework (MOF) materials are proposed to simultaneously address these issues and realize high-performance ZIBs with Mn(BTC) MOF cathodes and ZIF-8-coated Zn (ZIF-8@Zn) anodes. Various MOF materials were synthesized, and Mn(BTC) MOF was found to exhibit the best Zn<sup>2+</sup>-storage ability with a capacity of 112\u00a0mAh\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup>. Zn<sup>2+</sup> storage mechanism of the Mn(BTC) was carefully studied. Besides, ZIF-8@Zn anodes were prepared by coating ZIF-8 MOF material on Zn foils. Unique porous structure of the ZIF-8 coating guided uniform Zn stripping/plating on the surface of Zn anodes. As a result, the ZIF-8@Zn anodes exhibited stable Zn stripping/plating behaviors, with 8 times longer cycle life than bare Zn foils. Based on the above, high-performance aqueous ZIBs were constructed using the Mn(BTC) cathodes and the ZIF-8@Zn anodes, which displayed an excellent long-cycling stability without obvious capacity fading after 900 charge/discharge cycles.
