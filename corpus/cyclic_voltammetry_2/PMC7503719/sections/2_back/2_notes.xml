  <sub>1.8</sub>S nanocomposites, and assembled the half cells. E.-L.Z., J.C., and K.W. carried out the XRD, and SEM measurement of the as prepared samples, conducted the electrochemical testing for the half cells, and prepared the electric circuit for testing the half cell. L.-H.W., and Y.-F.Q. drafted the images in this article according to the results of XRD, SEM, and electrochemical testing, drafted and edited the manuscript. Y.-F.Q., and Q.L. provided supervision and funding, and coordinated the collaboration and the necessary work. Y.-F.Q. revised and edited the final manuscript and did correspondence with the journal. All authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.
