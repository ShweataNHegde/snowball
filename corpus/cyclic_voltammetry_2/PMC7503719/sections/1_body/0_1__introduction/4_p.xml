 <xref rid="B48-materials-13-03797" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, the synthesis methods are complicated and Graphene and carbon nanotubes are expensive. So it is necessary to introduce more suitable materials to improve the electrochemical properties of CuS. The synthesis methods and the electrochemical properties of CuS/Cu
 <sub>2</sub>S nanocomposites [

 <xref rid="B53-materials-13-03797" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] have been investigated. However, the nanocomposites of CuS/Cu
 <sub>1.8</sub>S have not been prepared and studied. It was reported that CuS could be reduced to Cu
 <sub>1.8</sub>S at a high temperature and a high pressure [
 <xref rid="B52-materials-13-03797" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In this work, we firstly fabricated CuS/Cu
 <sub>1.8</sub>S nanocomposites by a simple one-pot synthesis method at a correspondingly higher reaction temperature 200 °C. The CuS/Cu
 <sub>1.8</sub>S nanocomposites anodes exhibited high initial discharge capacity (1555 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 100 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup> and 1130 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 267 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>), excellent cycle stability at high current density (average 425 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 267 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup> during 1000 cycles, 472 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> after 700 cycles, and 325 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> after 1000 cycles), and excellent rate performance, which indicated that the Cu
 <sub>x</sub>S nanomaterials will be a potential lithium-ion battery anode.
