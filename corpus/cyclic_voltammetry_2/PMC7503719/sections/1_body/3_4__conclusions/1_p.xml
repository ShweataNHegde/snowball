<p>In this work, CuS/Cu
 <sub>1.8</sub>S nanocomposites were firstly prepared simultaneously by the one-pot Synthesis method at a relatively high reaction temperature 200 °C. The CuS/Cu
 <sub>1.8</sub>S nanocomposites anodes exhibited a high initial discharge capacity (1555 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 100 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup> and 1130 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 267 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>), excellent cycle stability at high current density (average 425 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 267 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup> during 1000 cycles), and remarkable reversible rate performance, which could be attributed to the nano-size of the CuS/Cu
 <sub>1.8</sub>S nanocomposites and the assistance of Cu
 <sub>1.8</sub>S. Though the more suitable ratio of CuS to Cu
 <sub>1.8</sub>S needs to be further investigated, the high electrochemical performance of the CuS/Cu
 <sub>1.8</sub>S nanocomposites indicated that the Cu
 <sub>x</sub>S nanomaterials will be a potential lithium-ion battery anode.
