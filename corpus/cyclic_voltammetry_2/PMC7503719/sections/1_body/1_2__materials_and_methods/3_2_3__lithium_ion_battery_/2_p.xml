<p>The electrochemical measurements were carried out on CR-2032 coin-type cells. The half-cells were assembled in an argon glove box. The concentrations of oxygen and moisture in the argon glove were lower than 1 ppm. The Celgard 2250 film and lithium metal disk were selected as diaphragm and counter electrode, respectively. The electrolyte was an organic electrolyte of 1 M LiPF6, which is dissolved in a mixture of dimethyl ethyl carbonate (DEC) and ethyl carbonate (EC) with a volume ratio of 1:1.</p>
