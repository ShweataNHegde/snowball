<p>The working anodes were mixed with as-prepared black powders, carbon black, and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) dissolved in deionized water with a weight ratio of 7:2:1. The obtained slurry was evenly coated on a copper foil and dried in a vacuum oven at 70 °C for 12 h. And then, the obtained coated foil was punched into disks with a diameter of 12 mm. The weight of each disk sheet was measured to calculate the mass of active materials. The mass density of the active material was calculated at about 0.4 mg cm
