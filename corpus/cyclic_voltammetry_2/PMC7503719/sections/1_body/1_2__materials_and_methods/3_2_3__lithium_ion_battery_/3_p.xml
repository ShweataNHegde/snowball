<p>Land-ct2001A battery measuring system was used to test the charge-discharge characteristics under different current densities with a potential range of 0.01 V–3.0 V. CHI660E electrochemical workstation was used to get the cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements with a scanning rate of 0.1 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup> and in a potential range between 0.01 V and 3.0 V. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also obtained by the CHI660E electrochemical workstation with a frequency range of 10
 <sup>−2</sup> Hz–10
 <sup>5</sup> Hz. All the cells measured were set more than 24 h to ensure total penetration of the electrolyte into the diaphragm, and all measurement results were obtained at room temperature.
