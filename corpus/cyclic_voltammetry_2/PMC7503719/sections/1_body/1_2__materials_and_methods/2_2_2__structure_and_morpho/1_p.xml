<p>Scanning electron microscope (SEM, GeminiSEM300, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and X-ray diffraction (XRD, SmartLab, Rigku, Tokyo, Japan) were used to characterize the structure, morphology, and composition of the samples. The XRD measurements were performed in the rage of 20° to 80° at a measuring rate of 3°/min using a Cu Kα radiation.</p>
