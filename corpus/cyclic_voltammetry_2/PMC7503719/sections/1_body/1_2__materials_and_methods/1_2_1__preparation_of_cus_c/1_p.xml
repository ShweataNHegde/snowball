 <sub>2</sub>·2H
 <sub>2</sub>O were sequentially added into 70 mL ethylene glycol. After1 h of magnetic stirring, the dissolved solution was put into two Teflon-sealed autoclaves (50 mL), which were heated to 200 °C and maintained for 24 h. When naturally cooled down to room temperature, the black precipitates were rinsed by ethanol and deionized water, in turn, many times by centrifugation (10000 rpm 10 min) until the solution is clear. Finally, the obtained samples were dried in a vacuum oven at 70 °C for 12 h.
