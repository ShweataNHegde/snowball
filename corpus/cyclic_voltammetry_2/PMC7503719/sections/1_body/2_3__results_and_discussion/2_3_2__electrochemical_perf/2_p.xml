 <sub>1.8</sub>S nanocomposites at 267 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-03797-f004">Figure 4</xref>a, the initial coulombic efficiency (CE) was 62.5% and increased to around 99% rapidly. At the same time, the specific capacity decreased from 1130 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> to about 450 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>. The values of specific capacity and the corresponding coulombic efficiency almost maintained to 1000 cycles with a small range of fluctuation, which demonstrated excellent cycling stability and relatively high lithium storage capacity. A fluctuation of the capacity can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-03797-f004">Figure 4</xref>a. It is found that the specific capacity of some copper sulfide materials gradually increases with the charge-discharge process due to a possible activation process in the electrode materials [

 <xref rid="B54-materials-13-03797" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In the experiments, the particle size ranges from 10–100 nm. The inside of the larger particles may not contribute to the capacity. With the charge-discharge process, the larger particles may decompose into smaller particles, which will provide more specific surface area and more effective active materials. In addition to the changes of the measuring temperature [
