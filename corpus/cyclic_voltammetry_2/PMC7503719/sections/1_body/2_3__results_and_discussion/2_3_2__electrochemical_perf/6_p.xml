<p>In addition, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-03797-f005">Figure 5</xref>, we presented a photographic image which is a test of a CuS/Cu
 <sub>1.8</sub>S nanocomposites half-cell after 1000 cycles illuminating an electronic watch and a LED lamp. The test demonstrated the high electrochemical performance and potential application of Cu
 <sub>x</sub>S nanomaterials in lithium-ion batteries.
