<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-03797-f004">Figure 4</xref>b, the rate capability of CuS/Cu
 <sub>1.8</sub>S nanocomposites anodes was further tested at a series of current densities. Despite an obvious fading of capacity during the initial several cycles, the CuS/Cu
 <sub>1.8</sub>S nanocomposites electrodes exhibited extraordinary stability and reversible capabilities in subsequent cycles. The reversible capacities had an obvious stepwise trend with the changing of current densities. The capacities were 1555 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, 485 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, 275 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, and 195 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 100 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>, 200 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>, 500 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>, and 800 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. When the current densities came back to 200 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup> and 100 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>, the capacities could recover to 470 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup> and 530 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively, which implied the outstanding stability and reversibility [
