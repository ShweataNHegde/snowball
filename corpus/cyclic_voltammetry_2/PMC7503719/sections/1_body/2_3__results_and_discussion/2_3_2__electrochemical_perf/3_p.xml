<p>The electrochemical performances of CuS-based electrodes as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries were listed in 
 <xref rid="materials-13-03797-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Compared with the previously reported results, the CuS/Cu
 <sub>1.8</sub>S nanocomposites in our work has good lithium-storage capability, high initial capacity, and good cycling stability. The CuS/Cu
 <sub>1.8</sub>S nanocomposites electrode could maintain the reversible capacity of 440 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> after 100 cycles, 450 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> after 500 cycles, 470 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> after 700 cycles, and about 325 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> after 1000 cycles. During the 1000 cycles, the average discharge capability and charge capability were 425 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> and 420 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> respectively. The high electrochemical performances of CuS/Cu
 <sub>1.8</sub>S nanocomposites electrode in our work could be attributed to the nano-size of the composites and the assistance of Cu
