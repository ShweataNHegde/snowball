<p>The morphology of as-prepared samples was further investigated using SEM, as is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-03797-f002">Figure 2</xref>b. It can be seen from the SEM image that the as-prepared samples consisted of nanoparticles with sizes in the range of 10 nmâ€“100 nm, which was consistent with the results calculated by the Scherrer equation. The mole ratio of CuS and Cu
 <sub>1.8</sub>S was measured by Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS). The EDS results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-13-03797">Figure S1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-13-03797">Table S1 of supplementary data</xref>, and the mole percentage of CuS is about 88%.
