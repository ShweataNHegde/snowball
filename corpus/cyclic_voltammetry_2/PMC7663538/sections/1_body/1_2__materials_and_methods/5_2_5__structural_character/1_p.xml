<p>The electrode samples were characterized by different experimental techniques. X-ray diffractometer (XRD) (BRUKER, Rivas-Vaciamadrid, Spain) (PANalytical Empyrean diffractometer, CuKα radiation, wavelength λ = 1.54045Å, accelerating voltage 40 KV, current 30 mA, scan range 5–80°, and scan step 0:05°) was employed to identify the phase structures of the composites. The surface morphology of the samples was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Model Quanta 250 FEG) (ThermoFisher, Hillsboro, OR, 97124 USA) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, JOEL JEM-2100) (Joel, Akishima, Tokyo, JAPAN). Surface area and porosity analysis were performed by N2 adsorption/desorption at 77 K using surface area analyzer (Quadrasorb, Quantachrome instrument, Quadrasorb, Boynton Beach, FL, USA). Before the porosity analysis, the samples were outgassed for 12 h at 110 °C under high vacuum conditions (10−6 mbar). The specific surface area was determined by applying the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equation to the recorded N2 isotherms. The porosity of the samples was evaluated by applying the Barret–Johner–Halenda (BJH) method to the adsorption part of the isotherms.</p>
