<p>The porous CX was prepared by dissolving a mixture of resorcinol (R) and formaldehyde (F) (R:F = 1:2 molar ratio) in water (W) (R:W = 1:17 molar ratio) using sodium carbonate (Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>4</sub>) as a catalyst (C) (R:C = 300:1 molar ratio). These were mixed using a magnetic stirrer to get a homogeneous solution that was poured into glass molds (45 cm length × 0.5 cm diameter). The glass molds were kept for one day at 40 °C followed by five days at 80 °C. The resulting hydrogel rods were cut and stored in acetone for three days to exchange the solvent media so that the surface area and porosity are maintained during the drying process. The organic gels were thereafter dried using microwave-assisted heating. The dried organic gels were carbonized at 900 °C (the ramp rate was set at 1 °C/min) for 2 h under N
 <sub>2</sub> stream in a tube furnace and were then ground into CX powder.
