<p>The electrochemical electrodes were prepared by mixing the pristine/modified carbon xerogels (90 wt.%) with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) (60% dispersion in water). The mixture was pasted onto disk-shaped graphitic substrates (0.9 cm in diameter). Afterwards, the electrodes were mechanically pressed with 2 bar pressure and left to dry overnight at 100 °C. Prior to the electrochemical characterizations, the electrodes were soaked in the respective electrolyte for 48 h. Symmetric supercapacitors were built between two electrode disks of the same weight in a Perfluoroalkoxy alkanes (PFA) Swagelok
 <sup>®</sup> cell. The electrochemical behavior of the supercapacitors was investigated by performing cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements in 6 M potassium hydroxide (KOH) electrolyte at 25 °C using a two-electrode system with a potentiostat (EC-lab VMP system, Biologic, Science Instruments) (BioLogic, Seyssinet-Pariset, France). The cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests were carried out at different scan rates (3, 5, 10, 20, and 50 mV·s
 <sup>−1</sup>) and different currents densities (0.1, 0.5, 1, 3, and 5 A·g
 <sup>−1</sup>), respectively.
