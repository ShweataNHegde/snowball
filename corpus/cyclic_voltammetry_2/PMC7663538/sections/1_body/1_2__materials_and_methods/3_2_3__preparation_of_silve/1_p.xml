<p>Silver doped carbon xerogel (Ag-CX) was prepared following the same procedure of preparing CX, except that silver acetate (CH₃CO₂Ag) was used as the polymerization catalyst, instead of Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>4</sub>. The amount of elemental silver in the carbon matrix was estimated to be 1 wt.% of the final carbon weight.
