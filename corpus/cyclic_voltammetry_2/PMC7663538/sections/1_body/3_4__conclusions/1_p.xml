<p>In summary, silver nanoparticles are incorporated into the porous structure of carbon xerogel by the sol-gel method. Silver doped carbon xerogel exhibits a more developed mesopore structure with lower charge transfer resistance, compared to pristine carbon xerogel. Upon functionalization with nickel cobaltite, an increase in the pore diameter of the silver doped carbon xerogel is achieved which enhances the ionic diffusion inside the carbon matrix. The nickel cobaltite functionalized silver doped carbon xerogel electrodes demonstrate highly efficient supercapacitor performance due to their high specific capacitance, low charge transfer resistance and ion diffusion resistance, and excellent stability. Among the different electrode materials presented in the current study, the NiCo1/Ag-CX (Ag-CX functionalized with 1 wt.% of nickel cobaltite) supercapacitor is the optimal choice for electrostatic energy storage due to its small catalytic particle size, uniform particle distribution, open porous structure, and low ESR of 1.9 Î©. Therefore, very small amounts of nickel cobaltite well disperse on the xerogel-Ag matrix can enhance a lot the electro-chemical properties of this composite materials as supercapacitors.</p>
