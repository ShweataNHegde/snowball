<p>The capacitance of Ag-CX is further improved when it is functionalized with NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>, as indicated by the higher current densities associated with the functionalized electrodes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-04906-f005">Figure 5</xref>b). The highest capacitance density and the best reversibility is registered for the NiCo1/Ag-CX supercapacitor, as illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-04906-f005">Figure 5</xref>b,c. The excellent performance of the NiCo1/Ag-CX electrode material is ascribed to the uniform distribution of the smallest Ag/NiCo1 nanoparticles in the well-developed mesopore CX matrix.
