<p>The charge/discharge curves for all samples at different current densities are shown in

The functionalized electrodes exhibit excellent capacitive properties and superior reversible redox reaction, as reflected in their greater charge/discharge time. The NiCo1/Ag-CX electrode shows an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 368 F·g

 <sup>−1</sup> (

A decrease in specific capacitance was observed for NiCo5/Ag-CX and NiCo10/Ag-CX as compared to NiCo1/Ag-CX, which may be due to their lower surface areas and mesopore volumes. This indicates that NiCo1/Ag-CX is the choice candidate for highly efficient supercapacitor applications, in which the kinetics of ion and electron transport is promoted at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The galvanostatic charge/discharge performance of the NiCo1/Ag-CX electrode at different current densities is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-04906-f006">Figure 6</xref>a. It is clear that the charge/discharge time decreases as the current density increases. This is mainly because of the shorter time available for the electrolyte ions to diffuse into the interior surfaces of the electrode. Interestingly, the NiCo1/Ag-CX electrode maintains high specific capacitances even at high current densities, which demonstrates good performance in terms of stability and fast responses.
