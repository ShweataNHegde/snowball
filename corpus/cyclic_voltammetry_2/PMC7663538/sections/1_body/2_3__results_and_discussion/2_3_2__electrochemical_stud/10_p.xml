<p>The power densities and energy densities of the assembled symmetric supercapacitors in a 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte are shown as a Ragone plot in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-04906-f008">Figure 8</xref>a. The NiCo1/Ag-CX and NiCo5/Ag-CX SC devices show very high energy densities of 50 Wh/Kg at a power density of 200 W/Kg and 47 Wh/Kg at a power density of 225 W/Kg, respectively. The higher energy densities of NiCo1/Ag-CX and NiCo5/Ag-CX relative to the others samples are a direct consequence of their low electrode ESRs which in turn provide better accessibility of the ions to the active sites of the electrode [
