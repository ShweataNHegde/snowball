<p>The estimated specific capacitances for CX, Ag-CX, NiCo1/Ag-CX, NiCo5/Ag-CX, and NiCo10/Ag-CX are listed in 
 <xref rid="materials-13-04906-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. It is obvious that the specific capacitance increases as the scan rate decreases. This behavior can be attributed to the fact that low scan rates allow enough time for the electrolytic ions to diffuse into the inner and less accessible micropores of the carbon xerogels. The introduction of Ag nanoparticles to the carbon xerogel matrix enhances its conductivity and improves the capacitance from 100 to 172 F·g

 <sup>−1</sup> while maintaining a quasi-rectangular shape (
