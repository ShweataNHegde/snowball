 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-04906-f002">Figure 2</xref>b represents the XRD patterns of the nickel cobaltite functionalized silver doped carbon xerogels. The XRD patterns reveal that the nickel and cobalt ions are completely reduced to fcc-metallic states after pyrolysis at 900 °C [

 <xref rid="B35-materials-13-04906" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We propose that nickel and cobalt ions incorporated into the gel framework underwent progressive reduction to form metal carbide at moderate pyrolysis temperatures and elemental metals and metal oxides at high pyrolysis temperatures [
 <xref rid="B36-materials-13-04906" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The functionalized samples show a diffraction peak at 51.8°, which can be assigned to the (200) plane of NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> [
 <xref rid="B37-materials-13-04906" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The intensity of the graphitic (002) peak as well as the sample conductivity decreases with increasing NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> loadings, which means a decrease in the sample conductivity in the order from NiCo1/Ag-CX to NiCo5/Ag-CX and NiCo10/Ag-CX [
 <xref rid="B14-materials-13-04906" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The Scherrer equation was applied to the XRD patterns in order to estimate the mean particle size (d
 <sub>XRD</sub>); the results are summarized in 
 <xref rid="materials-13-04906-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. NiCo1/Ag-CX has a mean particle size of about 26.7 nm which is the smallest among all samples. It is worth mentioning that a decrease in charge transfer resistance, R
 <sub>CT</sub>, is obtained as the catalyst nanoparticles become smaller [
