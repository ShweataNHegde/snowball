<p>The BJH Pore size distributions for all samples are represented in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-04906-f001">Figure 1</xref>c, in the range between 3.1 to 4.5 nm and the maximum pore size is about 3.9 nm. In addition, all NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> functionalized samples have development in the mesopore volume, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-04906-f001">Figure 1</xref>d. However, the volume of nitrogen gas adsorbed onto NiCo1/Ag-CX is the highest when compared to NiCo5/Ag-CX or NiCo10/Ag-CX. These observations show that not only the surface area is important for carbon-based supercapacitors, but also the development in the mesopores volumes. 
 <xref rid="materials-13-04906-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> summarizes the data obtained from the analysis of the isotherms using the BET equation in a relative pressure range between 0.02 to 0.09.
