 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-04906-f001">Figure 1</xref>a shows the isotherms for blank carbon xerogel (CX) and silver doped carbon xerogel (Ag-CX), which are closely resemble type I, which is characteristic for microporous materials [

 <xref rid="B32-materials-13-04906" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The sharp increase in nitrogen gas uptake for CX at low relative pressures (P/P° &lt; 0.2) due to micropore filling, indicates that most of carbon xerogel pores are in the micropore range. It also seems that incorporation of Ag in the carbon matrix as a polymerization catalyst increases the carbon yield which appeared in higher micropore volume (W

 <sub>4</sub> functionalized samples, for example, the hysteresis loops of NiCo5/Ag-CX and NiCo10/Ag-CX are of type H4 [

 <xref rid="B33-materials-13-04906" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], while the hysteresis loop for NiCo1/Ag-CX is mainly of type H2, which is found for micro-mesoporous carbons. These differences in pore geometries clarify that the silver doped carbon xerogel functionalized with 1 wt.% of nickel cobaltite (NiCo1/Ag-CX) has the highest mesopore volume, which would enable a facile transport of electrolyte ions into the active sites of the carbon matrix. In addition, all materials have additional large macropores, as appeared with some condensation steps at high relative pressures (P/P° &gt; 0.9). Due to the presence of all three types of pores, the materials are described as hierarchically porous carbon materials.
