<p>The interior surface morphologies of the samples are investigated using high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), as represented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-04906-f004">Figure 4</xref>. The HRTEM images reveals that the Ag and Ag/NiCo2O4 catalytic nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed in the carbon xerogel matrix, as illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-04906-f004">Figure 4</xref>aâ€“d, respectively. Moreover, the catalytic nanoparticles are observed to grow with a narrow particle size distribution until an average particle size, comparable to the size estimated by XRD, is reached.
