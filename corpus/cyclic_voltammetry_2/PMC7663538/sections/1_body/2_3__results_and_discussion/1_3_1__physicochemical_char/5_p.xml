<p>The surface morphology of the different samples is characterized by SEM as shown in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-04906-f003">Figure 3</xref>a) manifests a 3D porous structure that consists of spherical interconnected particles, which is in agreement with the reported morphology of resorcinol-formaldehyde carbon gel [
 <xref rid="B39-materials-13-04906" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Such network structures are beneficial for achieving both high electrical conductivity via the connected monolithic walls and high ionic mobility and surface accessibility via the porous channels [
 <xref rid="B40-materials-13-04906" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. It is found that the CX monolith maintains its interconnected network structure. The Ag-CX (
