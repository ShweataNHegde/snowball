<p>In this work, silver doped carbon xerogel (Ag-CX) was prepared by the sol gel method from resorcinol and formaldehyde monomers. Silver doped carbon xerogel is further functionalized with NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4,</sub> (NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>/Ag-CX) by the impregnation method to keep the surface area and porous structure of carbon xerogel. Different mass ratios of NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>, namely 1 wt.%, 5 wt.%, and 10 wt.%, were loaded into the carbon xerogel matrix. Symmetric hybrid SCs with hybrid active materials were fabricated and tested as supercapacitors electrodes and the impact of different ratios of NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> on carbon xerogel and electrochemical performance was studied and discussed in 6 M KOH as an aqueous electrolyte.
