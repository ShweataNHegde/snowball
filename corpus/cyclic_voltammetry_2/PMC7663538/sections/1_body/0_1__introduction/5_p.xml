<p>The hydrothermal method is a well-known process for preparation of metal oxides with different morphologies, but unfortunately, this method destroys the surface area of carbon which is an important parameter for efficient supercapacitor. M.M. EL-Deeb et al. prepared carbon xerogel doped with NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> for methanol electro-oxidation, he found that the surface area S
 <sub>BET</sub> of carbon xerogel after the hydrothermal process drops from 701.9 to 64.0 m
