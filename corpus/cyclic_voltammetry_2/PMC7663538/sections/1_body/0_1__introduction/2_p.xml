 <xref rid="B14-materials-13-04906" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] are widely used in EDLCs due to unique physiochemical properties such as high specific surface area, thermal stability, chemical stability, and conductivity [

 <xref rid="B16-materials-13-04906" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, the capacitance of carbon-based supercapacitors is still limited, for example, activated carbon nanofibers have capacitance of 60 F·g

 <xref rid="B19-materials-13-04906" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Although graphene and its composites materials have high specific capacitances compared to others carbon-based materials, its lamellar structure causes leaches for the dopant, especially in the liquid electrolyte.
