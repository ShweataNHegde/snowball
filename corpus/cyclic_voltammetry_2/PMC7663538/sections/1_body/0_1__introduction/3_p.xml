<p>Recently, carbon xerogel (CX) was used as an electrode material for SCs due to features such as its open three-dimensional (3D) structure network which prevent leaches of the dopant during its application in the liquid phase. In addition, it has high specific surface area, good electrical conductivity, and control of porosity during its synthesis [

The special porous structure of carbon xerogels can give productive dispersion/mass exchange and an enormous number of active sites for the electrostatic attraction and movement of ions/molecules and permits steady and continued transport of electrolyte ions and electrons to the surface, which prompts amazing electrochemical performance for supercapacitor [
