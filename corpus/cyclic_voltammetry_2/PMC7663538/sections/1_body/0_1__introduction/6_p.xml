 <sub>4</sub>/silver doped carbon xerogel composite has not been studied before as supercapacitors electrodes. A published work [
 <xref rid="B31-materials-13-04906" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] investigated the carbon xerogel with manganese oxide as supercapacitors electrodes in a symmetric and asymmetric configuration. In their study, they found a relation between texture properties of carbon and pore size distribution with the obtained capacitance, and the highest obtained capacitance was 213 F·g
 <sup>−1</sup> for asymmetric configuration.
