<p>In summary, a generic electrodeposited, electropolymerized, and electrocrosslinked polymer coating (thickness controllable PAA layer ~2-35 nm) allowing diffusion of H
 <sup>+</sup> but not bulkier H
 <sub>2</sub>O, H
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sup>+</sup>, and solvated H
 <sub>2</sub>O is likely to benefit many electrodes and aid their electrochemical performance. This includes enlargement of electrochemical window in voltage (2.4 V) and pH (pH 3-10), improvement of electrode stability and cyclic durability, enhanced rate performance, and multifold increases in the energy density of 127 Wh kg
 <sup>−1</sup> and power density of 237 kW kg
 <sup>−1</sup> based on the active materials of N-doped graphene. Exploring such an approach will help guide design and deliver new outstanding coated electrodes for fast-rate, high-capacitance energy storage.
