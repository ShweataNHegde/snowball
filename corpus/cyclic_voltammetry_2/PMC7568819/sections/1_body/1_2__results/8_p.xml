<p>To assess the utility of our approach, we evaluated symmetric cells with PAA-coated electrodes with two active materials, YP-50 and N-doped graphene, whose nitrogen dopants and high conductivity are instrumental in achieving a very large redox activity [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Both were incorporated into CCF-GP to give an YP-50-CCF-GP electrode and an N-graphene-CCF-GP electrode (see Materials and Methods and Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">S16</xref>), or YP-50 and N-graphene, respectively, for short. These symmetric cells with coated electrodes can withstand a voltage of 2.4 V (Figures

 <sub>2</sub>, then returned to 2.4 V, an unimpaired CV curve still appeared. That is, while a higher voltage did avail tunneling electrons across the thin coating to the PAA/water interface to enable HER, it left no impression on PAA and its subsequent performance. Neither did exposure to and testing in a strong acid (pH ~2) or alkaline (pH ~11.5) damage the coating, for the ECW after such exposure/test recovered to 2.4 V when the cell was retested in a neutral Li
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> electrolyte (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">S17</xref>). This is expected because, as mentioned in Introduction, amorphous organic polymers are dielectrically, mechanically, and chemically very robust.
