 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(a)</xref> has a small peak at 0.4 V. Consistent with its redox nature (originally from some oxygen-containing functional groups), this peak disappeared when the electrolyte was changed to 2 M Li

 <sub>4</sub> (pH ~6), which availed fewer protons to reactions. However, when the 2 M Li

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(a)</xref>) as if coating can provide protons to enable redox reactions at neutral pH, which we interpret as very strong evidence of proton buffering in our PAA coating. Meanwhile, there is a progressive expansion of the ECW in
