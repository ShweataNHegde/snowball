<p>After the preliminary screening (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">S4</xref>), we focused on polyacrylic acid (PAA, (C

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. PAA is compatible with electrochemical operations and is already used as an electrode binder [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and a solid/quasisolid electrolyte [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. It is also an electron insulator but a proton conductor, with a proton conductivity of ~1.1 × 10

 <sup>−1</sup> at 25°C (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">S5</xref>) that is fast enough for short-range proton transport in thin coatings, ca. 10 nm. We performed electrodeposition in a three-electrode cell containing an aqueous solution of Mg acrylate salt (2 M) that provides acrylic acid (AA, CH
 <sub>2</sub> = CHCOOH) monomer, along with a reticulated vitreous carbon counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. To receive a coating, three inert working electrodes were initially used: conductive carbon felt (CCF), polished Ti foil (stainless steel and gold also used but for brevity, their data were not included here), and graphite paper (see Materials and Methods). The coating readily rendered the electrode surface hydrophilic (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(a)</xref>), it suppressed H
 <sub>2</sub> bubbling at −1.8 V that otherwise would have caused fogging on an uncoated electrode (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(b)</xref>). TEM images of freshly coated and 2000 cycled CCF electrodes show that the PAA coating layers are ~15 nm in both, indicating it was apparently robust during cycling in 2 M Li
