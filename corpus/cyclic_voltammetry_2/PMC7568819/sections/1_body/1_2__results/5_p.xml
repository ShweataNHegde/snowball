<p>As mentioned before, carbon electrodes and their surface groups (see supporting information) are prone to oxidation at low voltage, which appeared as side-reaction peaks at 0.3 V and 0.7 V in Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(e)</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(g)</xref> during electrodeposition on the CCF electrode. (Understandably, these peaks were not seen on the Ti electrode). They weakened over cycles, and their existence can be manipulated by preoxidizing or prereducing CCF (see Materials and Methods and Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">S8C-D</xref>) that tunes the population of oxygen-containing surface groups partaking in reversible proton-mediated redox reactions. The same reactions also occur to YP-50, a carbon-based active material commonly added to the supercapacitor electrodes. Taking advantage of this feature, we prepared (see Materials and Methods) pristine, unoxidized YP-50, and preoxidized YP-50—to be called M-YP-50, which has a prominent redox peak at 0.4 V (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">S13A-B</xref>). They afforded two model active materials: YP-50 as an electric double-layer capacitor- (EDLC-) active material and M-YP-50 as a redox-active material. Incorporated into graphite-paper-backed CCF (denoted as CCF-GP, see Materials and Methods), the two electrodes were provided a PAA coating to enable comparison of EDLC/redox activities with largely the same electrode/active-material configuration, morphology, and microstructure.
