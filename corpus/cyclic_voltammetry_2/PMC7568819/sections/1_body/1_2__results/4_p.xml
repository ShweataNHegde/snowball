<p>Being an anionic polymer, PAA can readily incorporate cations, such as Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> in the starting solution. Here, we use Mg other than Li because Li cannot be detected by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). As shown in Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">S12A</xref>, elemental mapping confirms a relatively uniform Mg distribution, along with C and O, on as-coated CCF. However, if such CCF is next cycled 50 times (at 50 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup>) between −1.0 V and 1.0 V in a Mg-free 0.5 M H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> electrolyte, then 90% of the Mg content is gone (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">S12B</xref>), presumably replaced by H
 <sup>+</sup>. Subsequently, Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> can be reintroduced to the coating by repeating cyclic voltammetry (CV) for another 50 cycles, this time in 2 M MgSO
 <sub>4</sub> electrolyte. By now, the Mg content in the coating has increased by a factor of 3 (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">S12C</xref>), but it is still 75% below the original value (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">S12A</xref>). Therefore, the majority of metal ions in the as-deposited coating is probably trapped though not structurally bound to the polymer, so they can leave and reenter coating as dictated by the electrolyte composition and electrode's voltage/polarity. This ability to accommodate cations to various extents is natural for a weak acid like PAA, which can readily protonate/deprotonate to maintain charge neutrality.
