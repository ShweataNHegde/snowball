<p>Overall, YP-50/N-graphene cells retained better than 94/85% of the initial capacitance after 100,000/60,000 cycles (1 A g
 <sup>−1</sup> from 2.4 V, Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(c)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">S18A-B</xref>); under sustained loading of 2.4 V, their capacitance retention after 300 h was 86%/82% (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">S18C-D</xref>). Noting that despite a higher test voltage these are better values than those of uncoated electrodes at a lower test voltage of 1.8 V, we regard them as fully supportive of our hypothesis that a water-excluding coating can suppress degradation of carbon electrodes. Lastly, the ECW increment is again sustained over a wide range of charging/discharging conditions (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">S17A-B</xref>), so it is not an artifact of higher scanning rates as known to the salvation effect of Li
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> mentioned in Introduction. These advantages were not realized unless AA was used in electrodeposition. As in prior work [

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], directly adding PAA into the electrolyte (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">S10A-B</xref>) or adding PAA binder (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">S19</xref>) yielded no ECW-enlarging effect.
