<p>Thus, having H
 <sub>2</sub>O in direct contact with the electrode is crucial for forming

 <sub>ads</sub>, which is needed to lower the reaction barrier to allow HER to proceed at the thermodynamic potential

 <sub>HER</sub>. Therefore, we have undertaken a systematic computational study on the role of H
 <sub>2</sub>O in electrode reactions. Our study also included an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to take advantage of the understanding of such a reaction in the literature [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. These reactions require the diffusion of H
 <sup>+</sup> and OH
 <sup>âˆ’</sup>, respectively, across material surfaces. On the surfaces of noble metals and oxides, such diffusion is already known to be aided by the presence of a H
 <sub>2</sub>O molecule [
