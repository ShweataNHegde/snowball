<p>Chemically synthesized PAA was obtained by a typical free radical reaction. To be specific, 1 g (NH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>8</sub> (AR, Aladdin) and 5 g AA were dissolved into 100 mL DI water; after that, 8 g isopropanol was added into the above solution, which was heated to 65-70°C. A second solution was made of 40 g AA, 2 g (NH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>8</sub>, and 40 mL DI water, and it was dropwise added to the first solution over ~30 min. After thorough mixing, the solution was refluxed at 94°C for 1 h to obtain PAA. The mixture was dialyzed and freeze-dried.
