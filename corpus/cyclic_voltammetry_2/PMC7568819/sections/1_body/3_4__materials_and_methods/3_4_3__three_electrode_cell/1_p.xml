<p>In a typical setting of a three-electrode cell, the working electrode was held by a high-conductivity Pt clamp, along with a RVC counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. For electrolyte, either 0.5 M H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> (pH 0) or 2 M Li
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> (pH ~2-11.5) solutions were mostly used. This setting was employed not only for electrochemical characterization but also for electrodeposition of polymer coating as described below.
