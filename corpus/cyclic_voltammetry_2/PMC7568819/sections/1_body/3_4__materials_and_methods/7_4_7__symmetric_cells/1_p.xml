<p>Symmetric devices have two identically configured electrodes (identical in composition, size, weight, and capacitance) as cathode and anode. For example, two identical active-material-loaded electrodes were first soaked in DI water, then coated by PAA using cyclic voltammetry protocol in 2 M Mg:2AA electrolyte from −1.6 V to 1.6 V in the three-electrode configuration. The number of CV cycles is a control parameter: for active-material-loaded CCF-GP electrode (mass loading ~1 mg cm
 <sup>−2</sup>), we found 20 cycles optimal. The coated electrodes were washed in DI water to remove unreacted monomer and electrolyte. Finally, the two electrodes were separated by a glass fiber mat (Whatman) and heat-sealed by an Al-plastic film after adding the electrolyte (2 M Li
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>, ~0.5 mL). An assembled soft package cell is shown in Fig.
