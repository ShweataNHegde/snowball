<p>This work used several basic electrodes described below. By adding active materials described in the next section to them, additional electrodes were also obtained. Conductive carbon felt (CCF) electrodes were cut from CCF (Jinlin Shuangpeng Carbon Material Technology Co., Ltd. specific resistance &lt; 2

To preoxidize, an electrode was placed in an oxygen-plasma reactor (Harrick Plasma Cleaner, PDC-32G-2, Ithaca, NY) in air at a radiofrequency power of 10.5 W for 10 min. To prereduce, an electrode was annealed at 500°C for 4 h in flowing H

Graphite paper (GP) electrodes were cut from GP (Toyo Tanso Co., Ltd.) into the size of 20 mm × 40 mm × 0.4 mm, then wiped clean before use. Graphite-paper-backed CCF (CCF-GP) electrodes were prepared by bonding CCF disks (
