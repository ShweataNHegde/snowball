<p>The Mg:2AA solution was prepared by adding 8.06 g MgO (AR Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) to 100 mL deionized water with stirring, followed by dropwise addition of 28.8 mL acrylic acid (AA, with 0.05-0.1% polymerization inhibitor, hydroquinone, Xilong Chemical Co., Ltd.). The amber solution obtained after cooling contains 2 mol L
 <sup>−1</sup> Mg:2AA, with a pH ~5. Other Mg:2AA solutions with different concentrations were similarly obtained.
