<p>Activated carbon YP-50 (Kuraray Chemical) was used without further processing. To fabricate electrodes, YP-50 powders were first dispersed in an ethanol solution of 0.5% Nafion (binder) to form a slurry with a solid loading of 20 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>; then, the slurry was added dropwise to a CCF-GP electrode. The structure was dried under vacuum at 80°C for 2 h to remove ethanol to obtain an YP-50-CCF-GP electrode. Nitrogen-doped graphene (N-graphene for short) came from a previous study in which it was identified as OMFLC-N, S1 [

Modified YP-50-CCF-GP (M-YP-50-CCF-GP for short) electrodes are preoxidized electrodes prepared in the following way. A YP-50-CCF-GP electrode was subject to 200 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV) scanning in 1 M H

 <sup>−1</sup> (0 V–1.2 V). This caused oxidation of YP-50 and pseudocapacity with a prominent redox peak at 0.4 V, as shown in Fig.
