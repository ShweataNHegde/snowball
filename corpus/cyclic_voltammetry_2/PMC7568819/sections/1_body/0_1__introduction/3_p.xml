<p>Actually, the hypothesis has broader implications because the same thinking also suggests that perhaps water is needed for carbon electrode to corrode/oxidize, which has a very low thermodynamic potential (0.207 V) and is a well-known source of (a) electrode degradation during cyclic/sustained loading and (b) redox pseudocapacitance (see supporting information) [

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. So, a coating that denies water access to electrodes could suppress both HER and corrosion. Empirically, our hypothesis is also consistent with the knowledge that naturally formed water-isolating electrode coatings are associated with an enlarged ECW. For example, in Ni-metal hydride batteries, the Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> layer allows the cell to operate at 1.34 V—without oxygen evolution until 1.44 V [

 <sub>4</sub> layer enables 2 V operation—without hydrogen or oxygen evolution until 2.4 V [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Therefore, if a water-excluding but redox-permitting coating that is generally applicable to aqueous supercapacitors can be rationalized designed without relying on naturally formed coatings that are specific to the electrode/electrolyte combinations in question and mostly serendipitous in occurrence, the coating will not only expand the ECW and enhance charge storage but also improve the durability of carbon electrodes.
