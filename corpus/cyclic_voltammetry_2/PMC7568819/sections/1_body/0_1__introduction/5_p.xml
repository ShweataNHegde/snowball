   <p>Promoting proton transport needs a sufficiently hydrophilic and anionic polymer. (Nafion, the common choice for proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells, is anionic.) Moreover, the polymer coating should be dense and solid-like to allow diffusion of H

   <p>Covering very large specific areas on advanced electrodes needs a conformal coating polymer. Because the electric field is naturally concentrated at geometric asperities (the lightening-rod effect), electrically triggered
