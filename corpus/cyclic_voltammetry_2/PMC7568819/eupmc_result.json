Since raising the voltage beyond the thermodynamic potential for water splitting (1.23\u2009V) can boost the energy density, there has been much effort on water-stabilizing salvation additives such as Li<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> that can provide an aqueous electrolyte capable of withstanding ~1.8\u2009V.
