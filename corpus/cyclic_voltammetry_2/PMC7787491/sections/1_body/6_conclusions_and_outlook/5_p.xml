<p>As a final remark, the low-cost, environmental-friendly nature of Zn-based batteries, which are the two major advantages over other alternative battery chemistries, should be preserved in any of the proposed strategies. High costs are oftentimes incurred when additional materials in relatively large quantities are used. In these cases, the gain in prolonging cycle life should at least offset the incurred additional costs to make sure it is economically meaningful. Adherence to this simple guiding principle will limit the volume of ultimately unfruitful efforts even in basic battery researches and will help to define the most commercially relevant pathways toward affordable Zn batteries.</p>
