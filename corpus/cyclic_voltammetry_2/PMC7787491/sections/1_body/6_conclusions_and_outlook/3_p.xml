<p>This complex nature of electrodeposition, in turn, creates a platform to study the physiochemical processes and their interplay, particularly because these processes are sometimes adequately “internalized” and reflected in the morphology of the deposited, solid metallic phase. For this reason, in-depth characterizations of electrodeposition morphology offer a path toward tracing the dynamics of the physiochemical processes. Among the characterization opportunities, atomic-scale investigations of the composition/structure of the SEI layer and how it regulates the growth of the Zn electrodeposits would generate transformative new insights and be of immediate interest to the broader community of metal anodes including reactive alkali metals. Considering that Zn metal and Li metal share highly analogous deposition morphologies in certain regimes, it could be a quite feasible but as fruitful research direction that one uses Zn as a model system to understand the generic role the SEI plays. This allows Li sample’s notorious problem of sensitivity to be circumvented. Separately, a recent study on Li deposition based on high-resolution TEM shows that the initial nucleation and growth stages of metal deposits could involve the formation of glassy metallic phases (
