<p>Note also that in contrast to the large volume of work focused on the deposition process, the stripping process of metal deposits receives much less attention despite its at least equally important role in determining the ultimate reversibility. As demonstrated by Song

 </xref>), in situ techniques (e.g., x-ray phase-contrast imaging) can be used to monitor the electrochemical dissolution of the Zn deposits in various shapes. This could be a research direction that not only is of practical value in improving the electrode reversibility but also opens up some new room for fundamental science researchâ€”How these nanostructured metal deposits dissolve upon the anodization. The conclusion from these studies will complement the existing body of knowledge on the deposition process.
