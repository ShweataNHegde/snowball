<p>Electrodeposition of metals at battery anodes is, by its very nature, a complex process involving multiple physical and chemical factors, which play different roles in different regimes, as shown in 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref> to 
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. Among these factors, we have contended that the SEI and the crystal anisotropy are the two critical but, oftentimes, overlooked aspects of Zn electrodeposition under battery-relevant conditions away from mass transport limit. The transformative progresses may require out-of-the-box approaches conceptualized taking together these fundamental traits of Zn and knowledge borrowed from related fields, e.g., heteroepitaxy or magnetic field-induced alignment of Zn crystals.
