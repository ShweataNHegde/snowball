<p>In the course of implementing control over electrochemical growth of Zn, cautions need to be made against oversimplifications in the characterization, classification, and interpretation of deposition morphologies—The observation would hardly be scientifically meaningful unless the deposition conditions are chosen with reference to certain intrinsic properties of the system and estimates (at least qualitative) are thereby made to understand which regime the deposition system is in. That is, it is meaningless to draw conclusions about a factor’s influence in a regime governed by another factor. For example, mass transport is a fundamental limit that exists for any electrolyte, above which the system enters a regime where ramified, dendritic electrodeposition dominates. In claiming a system to be “dendrite-free,” it is necessary that one first compares the current density with the diffusion limit. The abuse of terminology may obscure that the fundamental aspects associated the deposition morphology and generate discrepancy across the literature—e.g., there obviously lacks a clear criterion in judging whether a morphology is “dendritic” or “nondendritic” in some contemporary publications. We therefore suggest that a more quantitative, scientific framework be used in describing the morphology. The discussions following 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> in our view provide a point of departure; the geometry of the building blocks (plate, wire, etc.) and the assembly of the building blocks (horizontally aligned, vertically aligned, random, etc.) could serve as the key descriptors of metal deposition morphologies that ensure a fair, scientifically meaningful comparison across the literature.
