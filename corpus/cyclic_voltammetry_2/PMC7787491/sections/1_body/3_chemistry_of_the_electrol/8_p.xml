<p>It is, however, quite unexpected that moss-like Zn electrodeposition persists across all the three electrolytes as shown by the SEM images in the bottom insets of 
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>. Clues to interpreting this observation could be found in a few studies that report the parasitic decomposition reactions of the organic solvent and the S-containing salts (

 <sup>2+</sup> cations destabilizes the TFSI
 <sup>−</sup> anion, lifting its reduction potential to 0.37-V Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>/Zn. This means that, at least, a portion of the TFSI
 <sup>−</sup> anions decompose before the occurrence of Zn metal deposition at 0-V Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>/Zn (
