 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> compares the typical electrolyte systems for Zn batteries: aqueous, walt-in-salt, molten salt, organic, and polymeric electrolytes. While all these systems exhibit some favorable features, it is clear that the aqueous electrolytes (

 <sub>2</sub>O illustrate the stable species in the electrolyte under certain conditions, e.g., potential pH. To avoid a pure solid conversion of Zn
 <sub>(s)</sub>↔ZnO
 <sub>(s)</sub> that has slow kinetics, a Zn anode operates either in an acidic regime or in an alkaline regime, where the oxidative Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> is soluble in the liquid phase. However, there is a thermodynamic potential for Zn metal to react with the acidic or alkaline electrolyte and produce H
 <sub>2</sub> gas in these regimes, creating a local pH deviation toward the neutral regime, which favors ZnO as a solid precipitate from electrolyte. Such precipitates can adhere to the surface of Zn metal, creating the interphasial layer.
