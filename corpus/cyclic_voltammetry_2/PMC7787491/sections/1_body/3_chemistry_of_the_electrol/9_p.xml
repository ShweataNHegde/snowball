<p>This exemplifies the second mechanism of SEI formation on Zn—redox reaction. Spectral studies reveal that the decomposition product of TFSI
 <sup>−</sup> is complicated—ZnF
 <sub>2</sub>, ZnO, sulfide species, N-rich species, and organic functional groups are detected. Calculations further show that the ion diffusion activation energy across these species is comparable to that of typical Li metal SEI formed in Li hexafluorophosphate ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (49.7 kJ/mol versus 51 kJ/mol). This comparison suggests the possibility that the SEI is imposing a strong regulation on the transport near the electrode, similar to what is claimed for Li metal deposition.
