<p>This type of acid-base reactions constitutes the first of the two formation mechanisms of the SEI on Zn. The SEI species formed via this mechanism usually belongs to the category of oxides or hydroxides. 
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> reports a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigation of the Zn nanowires electrodeposited from ~0.2 M ZnCl
 <sub>2</sub> aqueous solution. As can be observed in 
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C-1</xref>, the nanowire is covered with a thin, low-contrast layer (~5 nm), which is confirmed to be ZnO by high-resolution TEM in 
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C-2</xref> and electron diffraction pattern in 
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C-3</xref>. The observation of ZnO on the surface of Zn metal anode is supported by other ex situ electron microscopy studies (
