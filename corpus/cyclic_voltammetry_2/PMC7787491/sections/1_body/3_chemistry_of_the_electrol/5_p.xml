<p>This hypothesis is also consistent with the observation of moss-like Li deposition at current density far below the diffusion limit. It is also worth pointing out that TEM studies of moss-like Li deposits reveal that the long dimension is parallel to low-index zone axes, e.g., [111], which allow the exposure of low-energy facets, e.g., (110) (

 </inline-formula>, allowing the exposure of (002) and (100). The analogy between Li and Zn further suggests that the moss-like Zn electrodeposits are formed in a SEI-dominated regime. The composition and the structure of SEI on Zn and its effect on deposition morphology are still under active investigation. For example, some claim that Zn
 <sub>4</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>(OH)
 <sub>6</sub>·4H
 <sub>2</sub>O is also detected on electrodeposited Zn metal (

 </xref>–
 <xref rid="R99" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>99</italic>
 </xref>), as opposed to the ZnO observed in other studies as mentioned. Advanced characterization techniques, e.g., high-resolution TEM/scanning TEM, could provide important insights into the SEI of Zn metal to resolve these remaining questions about the nature of SEI and the role it plays in electrodeposition, particularly considering that Zn metal samples are not as sensitive to atmosphere or to beam damage as Li samples are (
