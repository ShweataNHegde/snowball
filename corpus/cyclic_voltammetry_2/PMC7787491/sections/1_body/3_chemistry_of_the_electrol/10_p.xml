<p>The SEI-forming nature of organic electrolyte systems explains the observed formation of mossy growth at certain low-current regimes. These observations can be compared to a series of recent reports about phosphate-based Zn battery electrolytes, where plate-like Zn electrodeposits are consistently observed at comparable current densities (

 </xref>). This straightforward contrast in Zn deposition morphology confirms that even in aprotic systems, the SEI can play a dominant role in shaping the Zn deposition landscape and, therefore, may need as precise regulation as for Li metal deposition. Understanding the SEI in organic systems with spatial resolution remains a relatively untapped area. Using direct imaging techniques, e.g., TEM, coupled with spectral measurements to probe the structure/composition of SEI, the ion transport mechanism across SEI and its influence on the deposition morphology would constitute a fruitful course of future studies centering on SEI formed in Zn metal deposition.
