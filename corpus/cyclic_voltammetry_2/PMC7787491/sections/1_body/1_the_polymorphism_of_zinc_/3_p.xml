<p>On this basis, we contend that to achieve Zn electrodes with exceptional reversibility benchmarked in 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, horizontally aligned compact Zn electrodeposition in the anode is required. Likewise, a clear understanding of the fundamental origins of transitions from operating regime where compact deposition gives way to less compact/more open Zn electrodeposit morphologies is an important first step in the search for interventions that eliminate these instabilities. We note further that while we focus here on Zn electrodeposition, these goals are not limited to electrochemically deposited Zn: For example, randomly oriented moss-like and horizontally oriented plate-like Zn crystals (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, F and G</xref>) are, in fact, observed in vapor deposition and liquid-state chemical reactions, respectively; the moss-like morphology is also widely seen in Li metal anodes. We will soon see that this broader perspective provides a promising path for elucidating the governing principles and for leveraging the conclusions for meaningful control of Zn crystallization in general. For this purpose, we, in the next section, discuss a theoretical framework built upon the classical electrochemistry perspective and then, in the subsequent sections, move on to the critical physicochemical processes distinctive to Zn, e.g., the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) and the crystal anisotropy.
