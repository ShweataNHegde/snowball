<p>The electrodeposits formed at any metal battery anode upon recharge are crystalline in nature. For example, zinc is a hexagonal close-packed (HCP) crystal. Although the Zn electrodeposits shown in 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> share the same HCP crystal lattice, they exhibit diverse morphologies as the deposition condition varies. The first challenges to controlling the reversibility of the process are therefore to categorize and to understand this obvious polymorphism. Here, we use two main descriptors of morphology: (i) the geometry of the microstructural building block and (ii) the assembly mode of the building blocks. The former describes the symmetry and dimension of the microstructural building blocks, e.g., one-dimensional (1D) wires with Φ = 1 μm and 2D plates with Φ = 5 μm; whereas the latter depicts the alignment/orientation of the building blocks with respect to the electrode surface in creating the assemblies that form the macroscopic electrodeposition layer, e.g., randomly oriented (

 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>), and vertically oriented (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>) structures. Notably, the dendritic structure in 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref> points outward from the electrode surface into the bulk electrolyte as a manifestation of the chemotaxis-like growth, which will be discussed later. The significance of this categorization becomes clear when one examines the plating/stripping reversibility for each of the morphologies: horizontally aligned plate-like (over 99%) &gt; nonaligned plate-like (80 to 90%) ≈ randomly oriented moss/wire-like (80% to 90%) &gt; vertically oriented dendrites (&lt;50%) (
