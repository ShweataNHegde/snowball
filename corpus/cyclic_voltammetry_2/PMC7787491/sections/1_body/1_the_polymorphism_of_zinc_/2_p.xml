<p>The low reactivity of Zn suggests that, unlike Li where a considerable portion of the Coulombic inefficiency comes from active material loss via parasitic reactions with electrolyte components, the inefficiency for Zn is more closely associated with loss of electrochemical access to the deposits (

 </xref>). This can be understood in a straightforward manner by picturing the microscopic ion conduction/electron conduction contact interfaceâ€”For dendritic structures, the ion-electron contact spans across the surface of the deposit, meaning that dissolution can take place at the root, breaking the entire dendrite off the electrode (

The randomly oriented structures situate in between these two extremes.
