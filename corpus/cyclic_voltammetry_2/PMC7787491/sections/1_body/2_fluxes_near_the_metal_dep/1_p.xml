<p>Electrochemical deposition of metals requires reduction of metal ions in an electrolyte at an electronically conductive substrate. The progress of the deposition can therefore be quantified in terms of the reaction fluxâ€”the amount of metal ions reduced to elemental metal per unit area of the substrate, per unit time. Multiple transport fluxes control the rate of delivery of metal ions to the interface and the rate of dispersal of the formed metal atoms: ion transport in the bulk electrolyte, ion transport near the electrode, and adatom self-diffusion of the deposited metal on the electrode (

Because electroneutrality must be maintained outside of the thin equilibrium space charge layer, the interplay among these fluxes and the local electric field can have nontrivial effects on the deposition morphology; in certain regimes, the underlying crystal anisotropy of electrodeposits may be preserved, and in others, it may not.
