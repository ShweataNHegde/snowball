<p>Briefly, theories based on the equilibrium crystal anisotropy and surface energy are able to provide a fairly good explanation for the geometry of the building blocks. They are, however, unable to explain another critical feature of Zn electrodeposit morphology—the alignment of the building blocks with respect to the electrode surface as shown in
