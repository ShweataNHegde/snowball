<p>In summary, through the discussions of 
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref> to 
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, an overarching theoretical framework is established to understand the polymorphism of deposited Zn crystals shown in 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>; this framework serves this purpose reasonably wellâ€”The factor(s) dominating each of these morphologies is unraveled. Specifically, the SEI and the crystal anisotropy are the central factors to consider in battery-relevant scenarios away from the diffusion limit. On this basis, we outline in next section (
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) the most active and fruitful lines of future studies aimed at precisely regulating the Zn deposition morphology in fulfilling the reversibility benchmarks specified in 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>.
