<p>However, note that the texture formed at the nucleation stage is not necessarily preserved throughout the entire growth of the crystal, because electrodeposition conditions can deviate from the thermodynamic equilibrium. This means that additional regulation on the kinetic aspects is needed to achieve smooth Zn deposition morphology as we mentioned in the discussions centering on mass transport. For example, a critical thickness exists for heteroepitaxy, beyond which the epicrystal can lose the strong correlation with the substrate (

 </xref>). In battery electrodes, this transition can be initiated by mass depletion developed near the electrode surface as the deposition proceeds. To lift this “correlation length”–type limitation of regulating nucleation occurring at the bottom interface between the substrate and the electrodeposit, regulation needs to be enforced at the front deposition interface between the electrodeposit and the electrolyte as already detailed in
