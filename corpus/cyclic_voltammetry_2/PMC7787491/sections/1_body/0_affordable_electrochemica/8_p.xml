<p>Regulating the morphology evolution of Zn electroplating/stripping with microscopic or even atomic precision is therefore, in our view, the key to high-performance Zn metal anodes for applications in affordable battery systems. With the specific aim of discussing the underlying scientific challenges in-depth, the review focuses on electrolyte, interphase, and anode design principles for achieving highly reversible Zn anodes. A more specific goal is to deconvolute the fundamental principles that govern the electrochemical deposition morphology of Zn. On the basis of that framework, we will assess promising approaches for regulating Zn electrodeposition morphology for achieving the exceptional levels of reversibility required to drive practical interest.</p>
