<p>The development of affordable energy harvesting and storage technology has in recent times emerged as a grand challenge in lowering humanity’s dependence on fossil fuels. Cost-effective storage of electricity has, at the same time, emerged as a crucial requirement to lower humanity’s carbon footprint by electrifying transportation and by enabling scalable use of renewable-sourced power on the electric grid. After decades of research and commercialization efforts, photovoltaic (PV) technology has, in recent years, advanced rapidly as a high-efficiency and cost-effective option for harvesting renewable electricity from the Sun (

 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> illustrates one of the two barriers to broad-based use of solar (and wind) as sources of renewable energy. First, the supply of energy from the Sun is intermittent and most concentrated during periods of moderate or low electric power demand. Second, the supply varies seasonally; meaning that variability of the power supply can extend over periods ranging from hours to months. Power interruptions on either of these time scales are disruptive and cost tens to hundreds of billion U.S. dollars in 2002 and 2015, respectively (
