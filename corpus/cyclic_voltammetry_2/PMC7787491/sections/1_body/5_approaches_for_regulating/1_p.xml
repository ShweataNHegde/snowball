<p>The cartoon at the center of 
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> provides an overarching picture of the scenarios involved Zn electrodeposition as defined. In the previous sections, the discussions are aimed at decoupling the fundamental physicochemical processes that govern the electrochemical growth of Zn metals in batteries. On the basis of these analyses, we now move on to consider the strategies to proactively intervene such processes and achieve desirable Zn deposition morphologies in batteries. As summarized in 
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, the regulation of Zn deposition can be implemented via (1) substrate/architecture design, (2) artificial interphase design, (3) electrolyte design, and/or (4) manipulation of the external factors. Each of the blocks in 
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> outlines one major category of the state-of-the-art attempts to control the Zn deposition morphology.
