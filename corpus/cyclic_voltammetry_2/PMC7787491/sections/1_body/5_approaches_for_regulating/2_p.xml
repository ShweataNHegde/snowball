<p>We first consider the onset of electrodeposition, namely, nucleation. It occurs at the interface between the electrode surface and the electrolyte. This interface shows dominant effect on the initial stage of the electrodeposition. The first group of strategies approaches the problem from redesigning the electrode—its surface chemistry, geometry, or both (see the red block). The Zn nuclei as crystals have a strong propensity for forming coherent interface with a textured, low lattice misfit graphene layer as an epitaxial substrate (

 </xref>). The initial heteroepitaxy (i) locks the horizontal alignment and (ii) reduces the nucleation energy barrier, which promotes a homogeneous nucleation landscape. The latter can also be fulfilled by covering the electrode surface with a “zincophilic” coating layer, which shows a good wettability with Zn. The metalphilicity also provides a thermodynamic driving force for smoothening self-diffusion processes as previously discussed. Metal-organic framework materials were recently shown to be capable of facilitating uniform Zn nucleation via similar mechanisms (

 </xref>). The control over the initial nucleation stage by these strategies will show a “guiding” effect on the following growth via homoepitaxy. This suggests that the strategies based on metal-substrate interaction would be particularly effective in the Zn metal anodes compared with Li metal anodes because unfavorable SEI formed on Li surface reportedly blocks the homoepitaxy process (
