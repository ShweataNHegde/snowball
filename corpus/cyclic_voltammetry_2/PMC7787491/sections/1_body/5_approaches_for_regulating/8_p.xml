<p>Charging protocol offers another opportunity to circumvent the diffusion limit–induced dendritic growth (

 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6K</xref>: A relaxation period is inserted to allow the reestablishment of the Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> species near the electrode, which prevents ion depletions and the initiation of electroconvective flows. Therefore, the dendritic growth of Zn is not observed when using a pulsed charging protocol (

 </xref>). The correlation is, however, not straightforward, unlike what has been shown for Cu deposition—Strong (111), (100), and (101) textures can be achieved respectively by optimization of the pulse parameter (
