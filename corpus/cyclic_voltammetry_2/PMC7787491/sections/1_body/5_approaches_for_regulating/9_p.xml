<p>To close, we draw the readers’ attention to a phenomenon that can induce large deposition heterogeneity—gassing (bubbling). Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) generates bubbles at the electrode surface, creating large volume change in closed electrochemical cells. The presence of bubbles on the electrode surface notably influences the deposition morphology; for example, these H
 <sub>2</sub> bubbles template the growth of Zn as visualized by in situ x-ray phase-contrast imaging (

 </xref>). This effect of bubble templating is exacerbated when trace amount of Cu
 <sup>2+</sup> ions is present, accelerating the rate of HER (

 </xref>). A study by Hsu

 <xref rid="R196" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>196</italic>
 </xref>), however, reports different observations, where no such bubble-templating phenomenon is observed; instead, the dendritic Zn preferentially grows among the bubbles formed on the electrode surface (
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6L</xref>, bottom). The authors attribute this phenomenon to the locally concentrated electric and mass transport fields created by the bubbles. The differences across these reports could stem from the specific deposition conditions (e.g., Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> concentration). Nonetheless, large local heterogeneity is in either way introduced into the deposition morphology near the bubbles. It highlights the importance of suppressing the gas-generating side reactions in achieving smooth, compact deposition morphology.
