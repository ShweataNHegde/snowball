<p>This section focuses on the application of 2D TMC and TMN (MXene)-based materials in LOBs. Numerous review articles have dealt with the synthetic strategies and properties of MXenes [

 <xref rid="B106-nanomaterials-10-02106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>], thus, we focus on summarizing current progress covering topics such as the role of 2D layered MXenes as essential electrodes in rechargeable LOBs. To date, the most common MXene-based materials used as potential electrodes in LOBs are titanium carbide (Ti

 <sub>2</sub>T
 <sub>x</sub>) and molybdenum carbide (Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C); these are explained in detail later in the section.
