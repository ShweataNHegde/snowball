<p>Recently, Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/C with a porous nanoflower hierarchical architecture was used to produce carbon nanosheets decorated with Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C quantum dots [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-02106-f010">Figure 10</xref>i–q presents images of ultra-thin 2D nanosheets with Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C that has self-assembled into a nanoflower morphology with an average diameter of 200 to 500 nm. The porous nanoflower morphology facilitated the migration of Li
 <sup>+</sup> and accommodated Li
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, thus exhibiting an ultra-high capacity (7500 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>) and superior cycling stability (104 cycles). The passivation of the positive electrode by Li
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and Li
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> was evaluated theoretically using an MoC hollow sphere electrode by Zakharchenko et al. to improve the performance of LOBs [
