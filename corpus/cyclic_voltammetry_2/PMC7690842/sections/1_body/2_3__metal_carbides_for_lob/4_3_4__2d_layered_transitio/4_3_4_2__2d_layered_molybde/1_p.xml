<p>In the recent years, numerous reports have been published on the use of Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C nanocatalysts as cathodes to reduce the charge overpotential in LOBs due to advantages such as the variety of valence states, high electrical conductivity, stronger electrochemical activity, and abundance. These compounds also have a Pt-like structure and thus represent a cost-effective alternative for noble metals. Recently, Yu et al. [
 <xref rid="B130-nanomaterials-10-02106" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>] prepared Mo
 <sub>x</sub>C (α-MoC
 <sub>1−x</sub> and β-Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C) porous nanorods derived from Mo-MOFs and employed them as the cathode in an LOB. Of the two as-prepared cathodes, α-MoC
 <sub>1−x</sub> exhibited improved catalytic properties due to a low charge transfer resistance of 395.8 Ω and a strong O
 <sub>2</sub> absorbability of −1.87 eV. The maximum discharge capacity of α-MoC
 <sub>1−x</sub> was found to be 20,212 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> with a discharge potential of 2.62 V. The prepared cathode also exhibited long-term cycling stability over 100 cycles with a high round-trip efficiency of 70%.
