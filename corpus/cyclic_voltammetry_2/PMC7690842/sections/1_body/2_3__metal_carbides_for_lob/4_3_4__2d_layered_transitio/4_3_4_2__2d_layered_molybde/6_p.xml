<p>Another important form of Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C that has attracted recent attention is MoO
 <sub>2</sub>-MoC cathodes. Lu et al. designed a heterostructured bioinspired Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C-MoO
 <sub>2</sub>/N-doped carbon foam catalyst derived from an ELKA 16-FLAG precursor [
 <xref rid="B138-nanomaterials-10-02106" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. The reported catalyst exhibited an outstanding overall rate performance with excellent cyclability. This catalytic performance can be ascribed to the specific hierarchical microporous structure of the 3D carbon foam. In addition, the doping of nitrogen into the carbon foam enhanced the conductivity and catalytic activity. Similar research was carried out by Wu et al., who fabricated a bifunctional Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C-MoO
 <sub>2</sub>/rGO catalyst and examined the synergistic effect of rGO and Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C-MoO
 <sub>2</sub> heterostructures on the performance of batteries [
 <xref rid="B139-nanomaterials-10-02106" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. Though the charging voltage (4.5 V) of the catalyst was high, it did not decompose the carbon matrix (rGO) and produced a high round-trip efficiency of 89%. The capacity of Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C-MoO
 <sub>2</sub>/rGO was approximately 2365 mAh g
 <sup>âˆ’1</sup>, indicating that the rationally designed catalyst had higher absorbability.
