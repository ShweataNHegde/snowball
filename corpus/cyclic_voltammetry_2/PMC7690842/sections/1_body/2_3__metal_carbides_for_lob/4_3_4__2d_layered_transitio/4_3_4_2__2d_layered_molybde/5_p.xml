<p>Previous reports on CNT-based Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C cathodes have highlighted promising results in terms of improving LOB performance. Oh et al. prepared bifunctional, centipede-like MoC-Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C on an N-doped CNT cathode for high-performance LOBs [
 <xref rid="B136-nanomaterials-10-02106" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. Interestingly, the prepared cathode had a nanorod morphology with excellent catalytic activity, which in turn facilitated electron transport through the N-CNT and provided sufficient space to accommodate Li
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. The Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C-MoC/NCNT nanorods acted as a promising candidate for use in LOBs due to their high discharge capacity (34,862 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>) and long-term stability. A composite cathode prepared by growing CNTs and carbon-wrapped Mo2C NPs directly on Ni foam was employed as a noble catalyst for LOBs, exhibiting outstanding cycling performance with a capacity of 10,400 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, a charge cut-off potential of 4 V, and a low charge–discharge voltage gap of 0.9 V [
