<p>Of the various forms of molybdenum carbide, Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C is the most stable because of its in-built OER and high conductibility. Based on these characteristics, a few studies have focused on developing Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C-based composite cathodes. For instance, an Mo
 <sub>2</sub>CT
 <sub>x</sub>/CNT composite in non-aqueous LOBs has been reported to deliver the highest discharge capacity of 9100 mAh g
 <sub>CNT</sub>
 <sup>−1</sup> at a cut-off potential of 2.0 V, which is relatively high compared to a pristine CNT electrode (5950 mAh g
 <sub>CNT</sub>
 <sup>−1</sup>) [

 <sub>2</sub>CT
 <sub>x</sub> with CNTs facilitated the transport of Li
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, thus enhancing the overpotential, capacity, and shelf life of the electrode. In a similar manner, Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C NPs on CNFs (MCNFs) fabricated using electrospinning delivered a maximum specific capacity of 10,509 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> at a current density of 100 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup> [
 <xref rid="B132-nanomaterials-10-02106" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. The increase in capacity compared to Mo
 <sub>2</sub>CT
 <sub>x</sub>/CNTs can be attributed to the high diffusion flux of lithium ions and O
 <sub>2</sub>, which prevents the blockage of Li
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> in the binder-free structure of MCNFs. In addition, the rich active sites and rapid electronic migration in MCNFs reduced the charge–discharge potential gap and led to a stable capacity of 500 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> even after 124 cycles.
