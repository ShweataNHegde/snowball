<p>Ottakamthotiyl et al. investigated TiC, SiC, and TiN, which are lightweight and chemically inert [
 <xref rid="B67-nanomaterials-10-02106" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. They employed two electrolytes, 0.5 M LiClO
 <sub>4</sub> in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and 0.5 M LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> in tetraethyleneglycoldimethylether (TEGDME). Li–O
 <sub>2</sub> cells fabricated with a TiC electrode were tested using both electrolytes, and the charge–discharge behavior was investigated at 1 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup>. Polarization was perceived to increase as the cycle number increased with the TEGDME electrolyte, thus, the capacity retention of Li–O
 <sub>2</sub> cells with TEGDME was observed to be lower than with DMSO. The surface of the TiC electrode was evaluated after several charge–discharge cycles using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Similar tests were also performed on SiC and TiN. The surface of the TiC electrode after several cycles contained significant levels of TiO
 <sub>2</sub> and TiOC. However, on the SiC and TiN electrodes, oxide layers were not observed. The absence of an oxide layer on the SiC electrode inhibited the charging process, and thus, lowered the capacity with each cycle. In the absence of a TiO
 <sub>2</sub> layer, TiN had a discharge potential of ~2.3 V and a capacity of ~100 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, which was lower than the discharge potential (~2.55 V) and capacity of ~360 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>. The poor activity of TiN was ascribed to its lower conductivity in comparison with TiC. This report claimed that TiC with a DMSO electrolyte could achieve an Li
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> purity of &gt;99.5 for each discharge and complete oxidation during charging, with a &gt;98% capacity retention after 100 cycles, which was far better than the results obtained using nanoporous gold electrodes and carbon electrodes [
