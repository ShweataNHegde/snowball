<p>In this vein, Ru-TiC nanowire arrays developed in-situ on a carbon textile were employed as a potential cathode for rechargeable LOBs [
 <xref rid="B74-nanomaterials-10-02106" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. As-prepared free-standing cathodes with and without Ru-support were characterized for their use in LOBs. A TiC nanowire array (TiC NA/Ru) with Ru-support exhibited higher OER/ORR activity and excellent cycling stability due to the uniform TiC nanowires grown perpendicular to the carbon textile surface without the need for a binder. The length and width of the TiC nanowires on the carbon skeleton were 30–50 μm and 200–500 nm, respectively. The performance of an LOB with Ru-based TiC electrodes was characterized using synchrotron radiation powder XRD (SR-PXRD) during the charge–discharge process (

 <sup>−1</sup> and 468 mAh g
