<p>Recently, binder-free, 3D-nanostructured TiC wire was grown perpendicular to a carbonized cotton T-shirt (acting as an air electrode) to develop self-standing electrodes for LOBs [
 <xref rid="B75-nanomaterials-10-02106" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Due to the light weight of the substrate compared to commercially available carbon clothes, an outstandingly high energy density was produced. As shown in the discharge plateau in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-02106-f005">Figure 5</xref>a, the discharge profiles of the TiC wire on TiC cloth and pristine TiC nanoparticles (NPs) were the same for the initial cycles. However, the cathode TiC NPs ended with a discharge voltage of 2.4 V before attaining the measured capacity after 30 cycles. In contrast, the TiC wire on TiC cloth had a stable discharge profile even after 100 cycles with a discharge and charging voltage of 2.7 V and 4.3 V, respectively (
