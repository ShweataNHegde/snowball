<p>It is generally agreed that carbon cathodes are unstable in air, which is a major problem that hinders the commercialization of LOBs. This is because the functioning of an LOB strongly depends on the reversible formation and decomposition of Li

 <sub>2</sub> over the surface of cathode. Hence, a stable cathode is essential to obtain better LOB performance. In this regard, titanium carbide (TiC)-based cathodes have been developed as a suitable alternative in recent years. TiC-based compounds have been widely investigated as potential electrodes in supercapacitors and LIBs because of their excellent electrical conductivity of 3 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> Scm
 <sup>−1</sup> and their general lack of side reactions during the electrocatalytic process, which in turn facilitates the formation and decomposition of Li
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. Inspired by these properties, TiC-based catalysts have been widely employed in LOBs.
