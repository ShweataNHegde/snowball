<p>In addition to the oxidation of TiC cathodes via the thermodynamic interaction with Li
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, another common limitation of these cathodes is their design. For instance, commercially available cathode powders with a binder mixture are unstable due to the decomposition of the binder. Thus, a balanced design for the ionic and electronic channels is necessary to transfer electrons to and from the Li
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-insulated material. In this regard, 1D nanostructures such as nanowires and nanorods offer better catalytic and surface properties for cathodes, thereby improving the electrochemical kinetics of the catalytic reactions [
