<p>It has been reported that TiC is unstable on a nanoscale and is readily converted into TiO
 <sub>2</sub> and TiOC via thermodynamic reactions with Li
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and O
 <sub>2</sub>, meaning that the catalytic process is strongly hindered by a TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-rich layer in LOBs. Yang et al. [
 <xref rid="B68-nanomaterials-10-02106" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] studied the effect of this TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-rich layer on the TiC surface using first-principle calculation. They also investigated the catalytic performance of oxidized TiC by comparing the O
 <sub>2</sub> evolution barrier for the OER and the charge potential using density of states (DOS) analysis. Based on DOS calculations, it was confirmed that Li
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> was readily adsorbed onto the (100) surface of TiC. In a similar manner, Raz et al. evaluated the adsorption energies of Li
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, NaO
 <sub>2</sub>, and Na
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> on the (111) surface of TiC using density functional theory and discussed the feasibility of using the prepared materials as electrodes for LOB and sodium ion batteries [
