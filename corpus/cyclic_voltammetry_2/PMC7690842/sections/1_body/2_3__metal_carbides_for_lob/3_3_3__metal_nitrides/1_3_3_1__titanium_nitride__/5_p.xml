<p>Li et al. prepared micro- and nano-sized TiN particles on carbon Vulcan XC-72 (m-TiN/VC and n-TiN/VC) as a cathode for LOBs, following the work done by Yarongwang et al. [

Of the investigated cathode catalysts, n-TiN/VC was observed to have the lowest recharge voltage as compared to other prepared catalysts, with a potential gap of 1.05 V. The n-TiN/VC catalyst had the lowest onset potential for the OER from Li

 <sub>2</sub> and the maximum reduction current for the ORR. Hence, the n-TiN/VC represents a suitable alternative for carbon materials, though further research is required to determine its dependency on electrolyte stability.
