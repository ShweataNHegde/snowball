<p>In 2011, He et al. investigated the properties of a TiN/C composite during the ORR in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells [
 <xref rid="B32-nanomaterials-10-02106" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Commercially-available TiN has also been employed as an effective cathode in LOBs [
 <xref rid="B33-nanomaterials-10-02106" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and reported elsewhere. They investigated in detail the electrochemical behavior of TiN as a cathode in LOBs using polarization curves, galvanostatic measurements, and alternative current (AC) electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Origination of high cathodic current from the ORR was noticed at an onset potential of 3.8 V vs. Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup>, which was almost equal to the onset potential of noble metal Pt (4.0 V). Here, at a current of 0.5 mA and under a hybrid electrolyte medium with a weak acid solution and an organic electrolyte, galvanostatic measurements were carried out. The discharge curve obtained from the galvanostatic measurements exhibited a voltage plateau at 2.85 V and a capacity of 20 A h g
 <sup>−1</sup>. TiN catalyst as a cathode attained a power density of 1370 W kg
 <sup>−1</sup> at 6 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup> [
