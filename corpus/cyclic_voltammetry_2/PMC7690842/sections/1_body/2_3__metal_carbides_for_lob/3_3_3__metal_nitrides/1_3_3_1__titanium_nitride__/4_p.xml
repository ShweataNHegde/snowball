<p>Here, the Levich experiments predicted that micro-sized TiN would follow the two-electron pathway, while TiN follows a dual path, in which two serial 2e
 <sup>−</sup> steps occur at shorter intervals and produce comprehensive varied appearance due to the presence of parallel and serial 2e
 <sup>−</sup> steps. The electrocatalytic activities of both nano- and micro-sized TiN particles for the ORR in LOBs were compared with nano-sized Mn
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>. Using the micro-sized TiN particles as a catalyst produced an initial discharge voltage of 2.74 V that decreased with time due to the presence of a small number of catalytic sites. It is also predictable that running the ORR through the 2e
 <sup>−</sup> pathway would cause the piling up of electrons on the cathode surface, thus reducing the voltage gradually. In contrast, the nano-sized TiN without significant loss over time, had an even discharge voltage plateau around 2.85 V, and the observed catalytic voltage was also found to be slightly greater than the potential of Mn
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> (2.80 V). The discharge curves of both types of NP are shown in
