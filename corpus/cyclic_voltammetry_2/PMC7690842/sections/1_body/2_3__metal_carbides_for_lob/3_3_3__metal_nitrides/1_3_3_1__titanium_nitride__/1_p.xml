<p>TMNs have been widely acknowledged for their outstanding physicochemical properties, such as their high corrosion resistance, robust hardness, and high thermal stability. In general, they are obtained by incorporating N heteroatoms in transition metal lattices, which exhibit the combined properties of ionic crystals, covalent solids, and metals [

 <sup>2</sup> electronic structure. Most of the transition elements, which are referred to as d-block elements in the modern periodic table, have five 3d4s electrons. Thus, there is no d-electronic structure in TiC, whereas it is present for VC. In a similar manner, the 2p
 <sup>3</sup> electronic structure of the N-atom verifies the d-electronic structure of early TMNs; for instance, compared to scandium nitride (ScN-0-d electron), there is a d-electron in the electronic structure of TiN. As a result, metal carbides are one d-electron short compared to their corresponding nitrides, which has a major influence on their catalytic activity. However, the ORR catalytic activity of single early TMNs is comparatively lower than commercial Pt-C catalysts, and they have been widely employed as ORR catalysts in the past. The possible applications for nitride-based ORR catalysts are still unknown and have not been discussed in detail previously.
