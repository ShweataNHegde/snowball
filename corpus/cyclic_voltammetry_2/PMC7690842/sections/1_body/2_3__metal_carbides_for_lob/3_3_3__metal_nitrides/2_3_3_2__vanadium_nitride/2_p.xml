<p>To improve the stability of VN-based cathodes, recently, Sun et al. [
 <xref rid="B102-nanomaterials-10-02106" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] proposed a strategy to introduce a carbon-coating layer over the nitride material. They prepared VN-coated N-doped carbon nanoribbons full-grown in situ over a carbon paper (VN@C) substrate (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-02106-f007">Figure 7</xref>c). The pyrolysis of the cathodes was conducted at temperatures of 750, 850, and 950 °C. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-02106-f007">Figure 7</xref>(d), the VN@C-850 cathode offered greater electrochemical activity by increasing the anodic and cathodic peak current densities in the formation and decomposition of Li
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. From the charge–discharge plateau (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-02106-f007">Figure 7</xref>e–g), it was clearly confirmed that the VN@C-850 delivered the highest discharge capacity (8269 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>) at 100 mAcm
 <sup>−2</sup> in a potential window of 2.0 to 4.2 V due to its greater OER/ORR catalytic activity during battery operation. These observations suggest that VN@C-850 could be a cutting-edge cathode for use in LOBs.
