<p>Vanadium nitride (VN), an early TMN with a polar structure, is a promising material for use in energy storage devices due to its high structural stability, good electrical conductivity, and strong electron affinity [

 <xref rid="B101-nanomaterials-10-02106" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>], have been developed and employed as a potential host in lithiumâ€“sulfur batteries due to their strong affinity for the adsorption of polysulfides. As with other TMN materials, VN also readily undergoes electrochemical oxidation when used in an LOB; thus, there have been very few reports to date on VN-based catalysts for LOBs.
