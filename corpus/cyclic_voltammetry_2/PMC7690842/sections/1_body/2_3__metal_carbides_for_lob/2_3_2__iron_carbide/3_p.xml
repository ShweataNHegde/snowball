<p>Recently, a unique architecture—a CNF-doped Fe
 <sub>3</sub>C/Fe (Fe/Fe
 <sub>3</sub>C-CNF) cathode—was developed via an electrospinning process. Due to the combined effect between the CNFs and Fe
 <sub>3</sub>C/Fe, the catalytic activity was drastically enhanced, which in turn favored the enhancement of the capacity, cycling stability, and rate capability [

 <xref rid="B86-nanomaterials-10-02106" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] also observed the synergistic effect of robust interactions between Fe
 <sub>3</sub>C and carbonitride, which illustrated the superior ORR activity and the moderate OER activity in a KOH solution compared to that for commercially available Pt-C electrodes. These observations undoubtedly pave the way for their potential use as a cathode in future-generation LOBs.
