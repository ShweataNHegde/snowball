<p>Littauer et al. first described the interesting Liâ€“O
 <sub>2</sub> chemistry in 1976 [
 <xref rid="B35-nanomaterials-10-02106" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], after which Abraham et al. demonstrated the LOB system using a non-aqueous electrolyte in 1996 [
 <xref rid="B36-nanomaterials-10-02106" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-02106-f002">Figure 2</xref>b, a typical LOB system consists of a negative electrode (Li metal), a positive electrode (primarily a carbonaceous material), and an electrolyte (generally divided into aqueous, non-aqueous, hybrid, and solid electrolytes) [
 <xref rid="B6-nanomaterials-10-02106" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. During the electrochemical reaction in LOBs, Li
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> is formed as a by-product of the interaction between O
 <sub>2</sub> and Li
 <sup>+</sup> during the discharge process before decomposing again during subsequent charging.
