<p>Usually, the cathode catalysts for electrochemical tests are prepared in a standard procedure as described earlier [
 <xref rid="B66-nanomaterials-10-02106" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In brief, the as-prepared TMCs/TMNs cathodes (loading mass = 1–3 mg) are mixed together with binders (Kynar
 <sup>®</sup> HSV 900 and Kynar
 <sup>®</sup> HSV 1810) and super carbon in a stoichiometric ratio of 3:1:1 or 4:1:1 in N-methyl-N’-pyyrolidone solvent to form a slurry. The attained slurry was coated over a substrate by doctor blade method. The thickness of the coating material is maintained around 90–100 μm. The coated substrates were dried under vacuum at 80–100 °C for about 12 h and then laminated into disks. The binder-free cathodes have also been studied and reported elsewhere owing to the binder’s decomposition with ether-electrolytes during the cycling process. The LOB assembly could be achieved in the following manner: a Swagelok cell consists of a piece of lithium foil over a stainless steel at the anode end and clean O
 <sub>2</sub> is applied on as-prepared catalyst at the cathode end. The electrolyte either protic or aprotic immersed Celgrard/glass fiber separator is placed in between them; then, the whole cell set-up is sealed in a glass container that is filled with clean O
 <sub>2</sub>. Considering the sensitivity of LOBs, the whole experiment should be done under inert atmosphere. The prepared Swagelok cells can be subjected into multiple electrochemical characterization analyses such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance analysis (EIS), and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) analyses. To identify the electrocatalytic mechanism and performance of LOB, CV, and GCD, analyses need to be performed at different scan rates and current rates, respectively. However, the formation of by-products such as Li
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> and LiOH during cycling process are unavoidable due to the side reactions, which include electrolyte and binder decomposition at the electrode and electrolyte interfaces. Nevertheless, the side reactions and formation of by-products can be largely controlled nowadays by the rational design of electrode materials and various synthesis strategies.
