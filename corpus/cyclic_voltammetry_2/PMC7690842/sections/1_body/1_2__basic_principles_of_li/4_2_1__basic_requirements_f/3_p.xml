<p>Recently, carbon-based cathode electrodes have been replaced with other materials based on metals, metal oxides, carbides, nitrides, sulfides, and their composites to prevent the formation of Li

Currently, carbide- and nitride-based cathode electrodes are under investigation as materials for energy storage devices [
