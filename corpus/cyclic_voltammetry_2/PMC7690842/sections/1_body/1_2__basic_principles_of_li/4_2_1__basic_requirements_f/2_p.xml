<p>Based on these considerations, various nanostructured carbonaceous materials have been investigated as active cathode materials in LOBs [

 <xref rid="B45-nanomaterials-10-02106" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Carbonaceous materials are predominantly used as a cathode in LOBs due to their high specific surface area for the formation of Li
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. To enhance the properties of these carbon materials, their morphology can be changed into CNTs and carbon nanofibers (CNFs). The one-dimensional (1D) architecture of CNTs and CNFs enhances the efficiency of charge transfer and the dimensional stability of the electrode during the charge–discharge process and its cycle life [

 <xref rid="B47-nanomaterials-10-02106" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Despite their advantages, CNTs and CNFs have issues with the agglomeration of particles during the electrochemical process, which weakens the performance of LOBs. To overcome this, 2D graphene was introduced as potential cathode active material for LOBs, though the re-stacking of graphene sheets as the number of cycles increases has become a concern [

 <xref rid="B50-nanomaterials-10-02106" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. To avoid this re-stacking, various metals, metal oxides, and heteroatoms have been introduced into the graphene architecture [

 <xref rid="B53-nanomaterials-10-02106" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The synthesis of three-dimensionally (3D) ordered mesoporous carbon and MOFs have been introduced to avoid the self-aggregation of carbon particles [
 <xref rid="B54-nanomaterials-10-02106" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Not only does the aggregation of carbon particles cause concern, the formation of Li
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> during the charge–discharge process is also a problem. The emergence of an insulating layer Li
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> on the exterior layer of the carbon electrode increases the interfacial potential, resulting in higher charging potentials and a lower round-trip efficiency for LOBs [
