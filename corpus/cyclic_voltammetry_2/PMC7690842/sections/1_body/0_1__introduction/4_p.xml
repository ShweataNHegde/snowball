<p>In recent years, numerous efforts have been made to find an alternative to noble metal catalysts and to design non-precious metal catalysts, including 2D transition metal chalcogenides, metal oxides, and metal carbides and nitrides. Of these, TMCs and TMNs have received particular attention due to their outstanding catalytic performance and high electrode material stability, which is similar to that exhibited by commercial Pt-C catalysts. In addition, their 2D layered form MXene and its composites have been employed in various materials science applications, including energy storage devices. As shown in
