<p>In the past two decades, the discovery of graphene and its unique properties has opened up a new avenue of research with regards to 2D materials [

Graphene and its composites have thus been broadly utilized in energy storage and conversion devices, but, due to the mono-layer thickness of graphite, they offer only a limited range of applications. On the other hand, graphene analogues, including 2D layered transition metal oxides, phosphides, sulfides, and selenides, have been considered capable candidates for use in energy storage devices because of their ultrathin nature and planar topology [

However, due to their low working potential, poor specific capacity, weak cyclability, and high-temperature synthesis, these compounds have yet to be commercialized. In the past decade, MOFs and their nanocomposites have also been investigated as excellent candidates for use in LIBs and LOBs owing to their adjustable physicochemical characteristics and ultra-high surface area. Nevertheless, the cycling performance of MOF-based electrodes is inferior to transition metal sulfides and selenides [
