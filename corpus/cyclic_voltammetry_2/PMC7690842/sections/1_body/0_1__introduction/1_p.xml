<p>The environmental pollution and climate change caused by the use of fossil fuels have been major causes of concern worldwide. To restrict the consumption of fossil fuels, alternative renewable energy storage devices with an enhanced energy density and power densities, including lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) [

LIBs and LOBs are also widely employed in high-energy devices due to their longer self-discharging time and excellent specific capacity. The specific energy density of LOBs (a theoretical and practical energy density of 5200 Wh kg
 <sup>−1</sup> and ~1000 Wh kg
 <sup>−1</sup>, correspondingly) is larger than that of LIBs (200 Wh kg
 <sup>−1</sup>) [
