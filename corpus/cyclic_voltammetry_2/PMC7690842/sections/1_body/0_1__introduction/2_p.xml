<p>However, their poor capacity, large polarization during the charge–discharge process, short lifespan, sudden fade in capacity, and sluggish electrochemical kinetics for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has restricted commercialization of LOBs, while their storage capacity also needs to be increased for commercialization. In addition, the large-scale production of these batteries needs further research attention because it is not easy to attain high energy and power density simultaneously and because current fabrication processes are expensive and have safety issues. To overcome these drawbacks, nano-carbonaceous materials such as graphene, graphene oxide, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and, their composites, transition metal chalcogenides, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), and transition metal carbides (TMCs) and nitrides (TMNs) and their two-dimensional (2D) layered composites (MXenes) have been investigated because of their inherent synergistic physicochemical and electrochemical properties.</p>
