<p>In addition, CO
 <sub>2</sub> and H
 <sub>2</sub>O contamination and the high discharge current rate in Li–O
 <sub>2</sub> electrochemistry limit the formation of Li
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, leading to poor cycling stability and cell capacity. To avoid these problems, the repeatability and reproducibility of Li–O
 <sub>2</sub> cells need to be guaranteed by ensuring sealing of the cell hardware, thus supporting the catalytic mechanisms during the electrochemical reactions. Overall, this review article expands the understanding of OER/ORR catalytic mechanisms and provides guidelines for future research on TMC- and TMN-based cathode catalysts, which can be used to significantly advance LOB technology.
