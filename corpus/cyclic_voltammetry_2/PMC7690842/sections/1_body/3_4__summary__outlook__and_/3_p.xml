<p>In this regard, the source in attaining cathode catalystsâ€™ must be expanded. To reduce the capital cost as well as apprehend a green and sustainable LOB electrocatalytic mechanism, the catalysts should be anticipated to derive from daily waste products. The side reactions and their corresponding by-products should be minimized during electrochemical process by the way of designing a new type of catalyst materials and to apply different synthesis strategies. In order to enhance the safety features of the LOB, the volatile liquid LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> electrolyte should be substituted by solid and quasi-solid state electrolytes. Henceforth, more attention will be paid for the interface reaction at the electrode-electrolyte surface, protection of anode from passivation, and conductivity of the electrolyte.
