<p>In this focused review, we have summarized the electrochemical catalytic behavior and storage performance of both bulk and 2D layered TMCs and TMNs for use in LOBs. Compared to bulk TMCs and TMNs, 2D MXenes and their composites offer outstanding capacity and a high round-trip efficiency. Recently, research has focused on extending the range of MXenes by exploring different combinations of elements to improve the performance of LOBs. However, their commercial usefulness is limited by their high cost (e.g., ~$366 per 100 g of powder, Ukraine Y-Carbon Ltd., excluding exfoliation, delamination, and other purification processes) and structural variability. Therefore, cost-effective fabrication processes need to be developed to reduce the cost of precursors and final products, while suitable solvents that can ensure the structural stability of MXenes for use in energy storage devices need to be identified.</p>
