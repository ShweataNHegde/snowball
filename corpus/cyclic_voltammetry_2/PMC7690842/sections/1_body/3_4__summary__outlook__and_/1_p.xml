<p>In summary, LOBs have strong potential as an energy source for future electronic devices and hybrid plug-in vehicles due to their higher energy density. In order to expand the commercial market for LOBs, a significant volume of research has been conducted over the past decade. However, the commercial development of LOBs has faced practical hurdles such as their short lifespan, poor specific capacity, poor polarization during charging and discharging, and slow kinetics of the electrochemical mechanisms for OER/ORR catalytic activity. In order to overcome these issues, a variety of cathode catalysts, including carbonaceous materials, noble metal/transition metal oxides, metal chalcogenides/phosphides, MOFs, TMCs, and TMNs have been studied. Of these materials, TMCs and TMNs have exhibited particular promise due to their specific composition and unique physicochemical properties.</p>
