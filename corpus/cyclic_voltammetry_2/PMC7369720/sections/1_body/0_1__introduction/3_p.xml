<p>In order to solve these issues, graphite and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been introduced to support the MnO
 <sub>2</sub> nanostructure because of their excellent electrical conductivity and high surface area [

 <xref rid="B35-ijms-21-04689" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Among conductive materials, CNTs including single- (SWCNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) have been used as supporting materials to form composites with MnO
 <sub>2</sub> [
 <xref rid="B31-ijms-21-04689" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Researchers have reported several significant results concerning MnO
 <sub>2</sub> with CNTs. Chou et al. [
 <xref rid="B36-ijms-21-04689" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], for example, successfully electrodeposited MnO
 <sub>2</sub> nanowires onto CNT paper. The composite CNT paper demonstrated good cyclability after 3000 cycles. For this reason, it acted as a conductive and active substrate for flexible electrodes of a supercapacitor. Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-ijms-21-04689" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] synthesized a nanocomposite of MnO
 <sub>2</sub>/CNTs by direct redox reaction. The result indicated that capacitance retained more than 90% of initial capacitance after 2000 cycles because electrical conductivity influenced the specific capacitance.
