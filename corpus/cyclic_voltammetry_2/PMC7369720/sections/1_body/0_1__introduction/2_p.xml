<p>A typical ZIB consists of a cathode (for hosting Zn ions), a Zn metal anode, an electrolyte, and a separator (to separate the cathode and anode) [

 <xref rid="B21-ijms-21-04689" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In general, the development of aqueous ZIBs has been limited by the cathode materials used [

 <xref rid="B24-ijms-21-04689" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In this respect, MnO

 <sub>2</sub> can exist in a variety of crystallographic polymorphs such as. α-, β-, γ-, δ- and λ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub>, depending on how MnO
 <sub>6</sub> octahedral units are connected by different types of network. While α-, β- and γ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> have tunnel structures, δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> has a layered structure [
 <xref rid="B30-ijms-21-04689" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Nevertheless, during cycling, MnO
 <sub>2</sub> suffers poor capacity and inadequate performance because of its poor electronic conductivity and the instability of its electrode [
