<p>Herein, the in situ reduction of potassium permanganate (KMnO
 <sub>4</sub>) using MWCNTs as a supporting material has been carried out to produce MnO
 <sub>2</sub> heterostructure on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MNH-CNT). The heterostructure was controlled via the ratio of an initial amount of KMnO
 <sub>4</sub> and MWCNTs. The as-prepared composite was examined to determine its physical characterization. Subsequently, the electrochemical properties and performances of ZIBs which used the MnO
 <sub>2</sub> on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MN-CNT) as the host material cathode, are investigated and discussed.
