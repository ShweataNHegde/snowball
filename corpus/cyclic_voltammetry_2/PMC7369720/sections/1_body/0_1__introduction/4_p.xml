<p>Besides conductive carbon support, using a heterostructure is an attractive concept in that two types of materials and/or nanostructures have been directly grown on supporting material, such as binder-free electrodes [

 <sub>2</sub> exhibited a favorable electrochemical performance due to its relatively large interlayer distance (70 Å) for energy storage applications [

 <sub>2</sub>, as the anode material of rechargeable LIBs, provided high initial reversible capacity [

 <sub>2</sub> heterostructure could lead to remarkable electrochemical properties as well as enhanced battery performance. Thus, the MnO
 <sub>2</sub> heterostructure was synthesized leading to an improvement not only of the electrical conductivity of the cathode but also the capacity and cycling stability of ZIBs.
