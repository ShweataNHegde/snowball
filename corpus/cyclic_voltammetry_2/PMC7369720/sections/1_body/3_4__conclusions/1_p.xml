<p>It is evident that the MnO
 <sub>2</sub> heterostructure on MWCNTs proved to be a high-performance cathode for aqueous ZIBs. The incorporation of MWCNTs was found to improve the conductivity of MnO
 <sub>2</sub>. The formation of the δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub>/γ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> heterostructure on MWCNTs not only enhanced specific capacity but also improved cycling stability of the MnO
 <sub>2</sub> cathode. Consequently, the battery utilizing the MNH-CNT cathode demonstrated high discharge capacity, high-rate capability, as well as impressive cycling stability, exhibiting its superiority to the pristine δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> electrode. Additionally, the capacitive contribution ratio of 43% at scan rate 0.5 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup>, reflecting the diffusion-controlled process, played a dominant role in the pseudocapacitive behavior of the MNH-CNT cathode. This work highlights the design of MnO
 <sub>2</sub> heterostructure on CNTs for high-performance aqueous ZIBs.
