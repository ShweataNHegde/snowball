<p>In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-04689-f006">Figure 6</xref>c, the ratio of the pseudocapacitive contribution at various scan rates can be quantitatively determined, and the results are displayed. The capacitive contributions of MN-CNT7525 are 40%, 43%, 46%, 57%, and 74% at scan rates of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 mV s
 <sup>âˆ’1</sup>, respectively. It can be seen that, as scan rates increase, the capacitive contribution further increases. These results are consistent with the b-values obtained which are around 0.7 for MN-CNT7525.
