 <italic>i</italic> vs ln 
 <italic>v</italic> for both oxidation and reduction peaks are shown. The 
 <italic>b</italic>-value denotes the slope of the plots. If the 
 <italic>b</italic>-value is approximately equal to 1, the electrochemical system shows pseudocapacitive behavior controlled by a surface faradic reaction, whereas if the 
 <italic>b</italic>-value is approximately equal to 0.5, typical ionic diffusion dominates the charge/discharge process by cation intercalation [
 <xref rid="B56-ijms-21-04689" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. With scan rates ranging from 0.25 to 4 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup>, the peak specific current increases linearly with the increase in scan rate. The 
 <italic>b</italic>-values for the peaks of 
 <italic>b</italic>
 <sub>o</sub> (oxidation process) and 
 <italic>b</italic>
 <sub>r</sub> (reduction process) are 0.75 and 0.77, respectively. It is indicated that the redox processes of MN-CNT7525 dominated both pseudocapacitive and diffusion kinetics. That is, the insertion/extraction of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> ions occurred not only on the surface but also took place at the pores inside. These results confirm the pseudocapacitive behavior of MN-CNT7525, leading to fast Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> intercalation/extraction and excellent long-term cycling stability. Such an outcome may occur with the heterostructure of MnO
 <sub>2</sub> on MWCNTs, demonstrating the material’s suitability as cathode material for ZIBs.
