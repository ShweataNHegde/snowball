 <sub>4</sub> aqueous electrolyte, is shown. Anodic zinc, dissolved in the form of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> ions into an aqueous electrolyte containing Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> ions, rapidly solvates in the form of solvated Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> ions during the discharge process. Then, the solvated Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> ions diffuse and pass through the separator to the MN-CNT electrode (cathode). The solvated Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> ions are de-solvated in the form of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> ions [

 <sub>2</sub> heterostructure of MN-CNT, as illustrated by the inset in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-04689-f003">Figure 3</xref>. Further, an electron current starts to flow in the electrical loop from the electrical conduction of MWCNTs. These three processes can be reversed when the charging process occurs. Firstly, Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> ions will de-intercalate from the MN-CNT electrode (anode).
