<p>In the initial cycles, a gradual capacity fading was observed for the batteries having δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub>, MN-CNT6040, and MN-CNT9010 electrodes. However, the battery using the MN-CNT7525 electrode showed a higher rate of capacity fading. This capacity fading may be attributed to the dissolution of MnO
 <sub>2</sub> into the electrolyte during cycling. Moreover, in the case of MN-CNT7525, a higher dissolution was observed. After the initial 30 cycles, capacity fading was seen to slow down. This is probably because the equilibrium of Mn dissolution takes place from gradual Mn
 <sup>2</sup>
 <sup>+</sup> ions’ dissolution in the electrolyte [

 <sub>2</sub>, MN-CNT6040, and MN-CNT9010 electrodes, however, continuously decrease until the 100th cycle. The better performance could be due to the structural transformation between δ- and γ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> of MNH-CNT [

 <sup>−1</sup>, CE being around 100%, indicating its good reversibility during the charging/discharging process. In contrast, the δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub>, MN-CNT6040, and MN-CNT9010 cathodes deliver capacities of 63, 81, and 96 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively.
