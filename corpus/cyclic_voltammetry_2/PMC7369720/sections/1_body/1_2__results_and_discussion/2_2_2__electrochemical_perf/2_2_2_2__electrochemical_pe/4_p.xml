<p>The lower initial capacity of δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> may result from its low intrinsic electronic conductivity because of the unstable state of Mn
 <sup>3+</sup> during Zn-ion insertion [
 <xref rid="B52-ijms-21-04689" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. This low capacity of the unsupported δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> (pristine δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub>) indicates that MWCNTs can enhance the electrical conductivity of the cathode’s active material. It is noted that the MN-CNT7525 exhibited the highest initial capacity. This high initial capacity may be attributed to the heterostructure of MnO
 <sub>2</sub> on MWCNTs for Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> insertion/extraction during the cycling process. Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> ions can insert into both δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub>, being smaller, nanoflower-like with a layered structure, and γ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> which is nanoleaf-like with a tunneled structure. Such a high initial capacity is superior to that of the δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> cathode and most reported Zn-ion batteries, including onion-like carbon (OLC)-integrated α-MnO
