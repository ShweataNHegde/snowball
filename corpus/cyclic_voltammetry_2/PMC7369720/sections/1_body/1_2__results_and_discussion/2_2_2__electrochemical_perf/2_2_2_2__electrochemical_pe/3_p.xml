<p>In order to compare the battery performance of MN-CNT, having different ratios of MnO
 <sub>2</sub> and MWCNTs, as the cathode for ZIBs, δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> is used as a comparable cathode. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-04689-f005">Figure 5</xref>a displays the cycling behavior of the δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> and MN-CNT electrodes along with the corresponding coulombic efficiency (CE) of MN-CNT7525, under the specific current density of 400 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup> in the potential range of 1.0-1.8 V. The initial discharge capacities of MN-CNT6040, MN-CNT7525, MN-CNT9010 and δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> are 177, 236, 135, and 129 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively.
