<p>The electrochemical properties of δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> and MN-CNT, having different ratios of MnO
 <sub>2</sub> and MWCNTs cathodes, were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) within the potential range of 1.0–1.8 V vs. Zn/Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> at a scan rate of 0.5 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup>. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-04689-f004">Figure 4</xref>a displays CV plots of their corresponding samples. Two distinct peaks of MN-CNT are observed: the cathodic peak at around 1.3 and 1.1 V and the anodic peak at 1.54 and 1.65 V. CV having two peaks, during discharge and charge, exhibits typical characteristics of the electrochemical insertion/extraction of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> ions in MnO
 <sub>2</sub> structure [

 <xref rid="B47-ijms-21-04689" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. According to previous studies, these peaks mainly suggest that the insertion/extraction of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> ions into/out of the interlayers of δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> are associated with the reduction of Mn (IV) to Mn (III) and oxidation of Mn (III) to Mn (IV), respectively [

 <xref rid="B49-ijms-21-04689" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. It is noted that the cathodic peak of MN-CNT7525 ∼ 1.1 V shifts to lower potential ∼ 1.05 V and the anodic peak of MN-CNT7525 ∼ 1.65 V shifts to higher potential ∼ 1.7 V. This may be affected by the insertion/extraction of zinc ions into/out of the γ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> of the MnO
 <sub>2</sub> heterostructure of MN-CNT cathode.
