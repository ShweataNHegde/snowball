 <sub>2</sub> and MN-CNTs host material cathodes are displayed. Cycling takes place at various specific current densities of 200, 400, 800 and 1600 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup> having five cycles for each rate. The rate performance of MN-CNT7525 was significantly higher than those of δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub>, MN-CNT6040, and MN-CNT9010. The MN-CNT7525 cathode can be charged and discharged at a high rate of 1600 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>, leading to a discharge and charge capacity of 108 and 95 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. It is indicated that the MnO
 <sub>2</sub> heterostructure of MN-CNT with its small nanoscale morphology of δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> nanoflower-like and short-length crystal structure of γ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> provides a faster ion diffusion rate at a high current density. When the current turns back to 200 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>, the MN-CNT7525 cathode can deliver both discharge and charge capacity of 226 and 212 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. It is clear, therefore, that the MnO
 <sub>2</sub> heterostructure of MN-CNT can improve not only cycling stability but also the rate performance for ZIBs. This behavior indicates that the MNH-CNT cathode can well be considered as Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> ion storage material [
