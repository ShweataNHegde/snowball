 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-04689-f002">Figure 2</xref>a, the structure of MN-CNT, having different ratios of MnO
 <sub>2</sub> and MWCNTs, is depicted and the corresponding morphological changes are shown. To determine the morphology of MN-CNTs, FESEM was carried out and the images are displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-04689-f002">Figure 2</xref>b–d. MnO
 <sub>2</sub> nanostructures are dispersed on the MWCNTs continuously. Besides, the type of MnO
 <sub>2</sub> changed from δ- to γ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub>, as the amount of KMnO
 <sub>4</sub> in the solution decreased. To be specific, the flower-like δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> nanostructures, having petals about 100 nm in size in the MN-CNT9010 sample, change to the heterostructure of δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> with petals being the size of 50 nm as well as leaf-like γ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> nanostructures having leaves around 150 nm in the MN-CNT7525 sample. It is demonstrated that, by limiting the amount of KMnO
 <sub>4</sub>, the δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> cannot be completely generated. On the contrary, γ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> can form while the concentration of KMnO
 <sub>4</sub> is still low during redox reaction. By continuing to decrease the amount of KMnO
 <sub>4</sub> to 60% by weight, γ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> nanostructures can only be observed in the MN-CNT6040 sample. In 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-04689">Figure S1 of the supplementary file</xref>, lower magnification FESEM images of MN-CNT9010, MN-CNT7525, and MN-CNT6040 are presented. The MN-CNT, having two nanostructures of δ- and γ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> assists in increasing the contact area of the smaller petal size of δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> between the electrolyte and cathode material, ensuring fast ion transfer in the charge/discharge process [
 <xref rid="B43-ijms-21-04689" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Besides, the γ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> in MNH-CNT is comprised not only of randomly arranged 1×1 and 1×2 tunnels, which are beneficial for Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> ions intercalation/deintercalation but also accommodates the structural transformation from tunneled-type γ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> to the layered-type of Zn
 <sub>y</sub>MnO
 <sub>2</sub>. Such a randomly arranged structure can improve the stability of capacity during the cycling process [
