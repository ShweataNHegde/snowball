<p>In 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-04689">Figure S2 of the supplementary file</xref>, transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of MN-CNT having different ratios of MnO
 <sub>2</sub> and MWCNTs are shown. In the case of MN-CNT6040 and MN-CNT7525, it is obvious that MnO
 <sub>2</sub> formed on the MWCNTs. However, in the case of MN-CNT9010, MWCNTs cannot be seen clearly in the TEM image as a high amount of MnO
 <sub>2</sub> was loaded. Thus, all parts of the MWCNTs were covered by MnO
 <sub>2</sub>. The transmission electron microscope with energy dispersive spectroscopy (TEM-EDS) (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-04689">Figure S3 of the supplementary file</xref>) confirmed that carbon atoms of MWCNTs existed on MN-CNT9010. This proved to be in good agreement with XRD results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-04689-f001">Figure 1</xref>), where the presence of MWCNTs in MN-CNT9010 was observed.
