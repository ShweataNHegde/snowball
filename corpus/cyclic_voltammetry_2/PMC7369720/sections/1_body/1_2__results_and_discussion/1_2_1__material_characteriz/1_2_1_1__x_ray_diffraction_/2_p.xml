<p>The outer wall of MWCNTs was oxidized by KMnO
 <sub>4</sub> under strong acid condition. Further, MnO
 <sub>2</sub> materialized due to redox reaction in which KMnO
 <sub>4</sub> acted as an oxidant. This process led to the homogenous coverage of MnO
 <sub>2</sub> formed on the MWCNTâ€™s surface.
