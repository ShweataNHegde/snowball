<p>XRD was conducted to study the crystal structure of the samples. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-04689-f001">Figure 1</xref>, XRD patterns of pristine δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub>, MWCNTs and MN-CNTs having different ratios of MnO
 <sub>2</sub> and MWCNTs are shown. MN-CNT6040, MN-CNT7525 and MN-CNT9010 represent the MN-CNTs having MnO
 <sub>2</sub> and MWCNT ratios of 60:40, 75:25 and 90:10, respectively. It can be seen that the pure MWCNTs show a sharp peak at around 26° and broad weak peaks at around 42°, which are characteristic of CNTs [
 <xref rid="B35-ijms-21-04689" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The four broad peaks of the MN-CNT9010 at around 12°, 24°, 37°, and 66° correspond to the crystal planes of (001), (002), (−111), and (−312) in δ-type MnO
 <sub>2</sub> (JCPDS 80-1098), respectively [
 <xref rid="B30-ijms-21-04689" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-ijms-21-04689" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. They are similar to all the peaks of δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub>. The broad peaks of the MN-CNT6040 at around 22°, 36.5°, 42°, and 56° correspond to the crystal planes of (120), (131), (300), and (160) in γ-type MnO
 <sub>2</sub> (JCPDS 14-0644), respectively [
 <xref rid="B41-ijms-21-04689" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-ijms-21-04689" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The MN-CNT7525 presents all the peaks of δ-type and γ-type MnO
 <sub>2</sub>, indicating that the heterostructure of MnO
 <sub>2</sub> is growth with 75:25 ratio of MnO
 <sub>2</sub> and MWCNT.
