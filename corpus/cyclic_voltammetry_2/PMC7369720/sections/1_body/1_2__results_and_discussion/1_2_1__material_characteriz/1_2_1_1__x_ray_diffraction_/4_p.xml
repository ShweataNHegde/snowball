<p>The weak-intensity diffraction peaks of MWCNTs on the XRD pattern of the MN-CNT may result from both the broad and high diffraction peaks of MnO
 <sub>2</sub> at around 24° and 22° for δ- and γ-type MnO
 <sub>2</sub>, which defeats the signal of MWCNTs [
 <xref rid="B36-ijms-21-04689" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The calculated crystallite sizes of MN-CNT9010 and MN-CNT6040, obtained via Scherrer equation, are 7 and 12 nm, respectively. The calculated crystallite sizes of γ- and δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> in MN-CNT7525 are 13 and 8 nm, respectively. The crystallite sizes of δ- and γ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> are the same when they are in the MnO
 <sub>2</sub> heterostructure of MN-CNT. δ- and γ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> possess a layered and tunneled structure, respectively. It is suggested that foreign cations can insert/extract both a layered and tunneled structure, with the result that electrochemical performance can be enhanced by the MNH-CNT and thereby can be useful for energy storage applications [
