<p>The compared δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles were synthesized by dissolving 1.98 g of KMnO
 <sub>4</sub> in 60 mL of deionized (DI) water. Next, 0.336 g of MnSO
 <sub>4</sub>⋅H
 <sub>2</sub>O was dissolved in 20 mL of DI water. Then, the MnSO
 <sub>4</sub>⋅H
 <sub>2</sub>O solution was added dropwise to KMnO
 <sub>4</sub> solution, and continuous stirring followed for 30 min. Afterwards, the mixture was transferred into a 100-mL Teflon autoclave and kept at 160 °C for 24 h in an oil bath. The product was dried at 80 °C for 12 h. It was duly collected and washed with DI water several times. MN-CNT was synthesized via thermal reaction. Then, 300 mg of MWCNTs were ground together in a mortar with KMnO
 <sub>4</sub>. The amount of KMnO
 <sub>4</sub> was varied (1.35, 1.95, and 2.85 g) to provide different ratios of MnO
 <sub>2</sub> and MWCNTs by 60:40 (MN-CNT6040), 75:25 (MN-CNT7525), and 90:10 (MN-CNT9010), respectively. Next, the mixed powder was dispersed in 300 mL of water stirring for 10 min. A total of 0.5 mL of concentrated H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> was added to the above mixture with an additional 30 min of stirring. After that, the mixed solution was heated in an oil bath at 80 °C with continuous magnetic stirring for 1 h. The precipitate was washed and collected by centrifuging repeatedly with deionized water after the mixture was cooled to room temperature. Then, the solid product was dried in a vacuum at 50 °C for 24 h to obtain MN-CNT composite.
