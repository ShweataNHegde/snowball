<p>Electrochemical measurements were carried out using a cup cell. CV was performed by the electrochemical measurement system (HZ-5000, Hokuto Denko, Tokyo, Japan) at a scan rate of 0.5 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup> in the voltage range 1.0–1.8 V versus Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>/Zn. A battery testing system (EF-7100P, Electrofield, Osaka, Japan) was used to investigate the performance of the battery. The CVs for investigating capacitive behavior were tested at scanning rates from 0.25 to 4.0 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup> between 1.0 and 1.8 V.
