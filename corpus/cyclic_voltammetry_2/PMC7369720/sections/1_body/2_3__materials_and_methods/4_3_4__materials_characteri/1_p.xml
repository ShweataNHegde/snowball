<p>The phase states of MN-CNT were analyzed using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD, Rigaku Model Miniflex II, Tokyo, Japan) of the powder samples with Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5418 Å at a scanning range of 5-90°. Field emission-scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JEOL JSM-6701F, Tokyo, Japan) was used to observe the morphological image of MN-CNT. Transmission electron microscope with energy dispersive spectroscopy (TEM-EDS, JEOL JEM-2000FX, Tokyo, Japan) was used to prove the presence of MWCNTs in MN-CNTs.</p>
