<p>The cathode using MN-CNT was prepared by mixing 70% wt. of MN-CNT, 20% wt. of carbon black, and 10% wt. of carboxymethylcellulose sodium salt binder. For comparison, the cathode of δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> was fabricated the same way using pristine δ-MnO
 <sub>2</sub> instead of MN-CNT. DI water was used to adjust the viscosity of the slurries. Each mixed slurry was stirred for 24 h at room temperature. Then, it was coated on a graphite foil current collector using a doctor blade and dried at 50 °C under vacuum before it was pressed by hydraulic press at 5 kPa for 1 min. The cathode contained about 5 mg of MN-CNT. Zinc anode was prepared by electrodeposition of zinc from ZnSO
 <sub>4</sub> (0.5 M) aqueous solution onto Ni foam using zinc sheet as a counter electrode at current density of 60 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup>. The amount of Zn deposited was 20 mg cm
 <sup>−2</sup>. Both the cathode and anode were punched into a 16-mm-diameter disk. The filter paper was punched into a 20-mm disk and used as the separator. Then, the cathode, anode and separator were fabricated in a cup cell by using 0.3 mL of aqueous ZnSO
 <sub>4</sub> (1 M) as the electrolyte.
