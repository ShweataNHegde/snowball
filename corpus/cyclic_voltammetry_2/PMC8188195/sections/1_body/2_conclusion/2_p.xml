<p>We have developed a PANZ coating layer consisting of PAN polymer and zinc salt on a Zn anode (PANZ@Zn) to suppress dendrite formation in ARZIBs. The zinc‐ion transport channels in the PANZ coating layer serve as a zinc‐ion flux regulator and enhance the uniform deposition of zinc ions on the zinc substrate. As a result, the PANZ coating layer reduces the interfacial impedance, resists dendrite formation, and alleviates side reactions on the zinc anode. Consequently, the PANZ@Zn anode in the symmetric batteries shows a dendrite‐free surface, and the symmetric cell has a longer lifespan than that of the uncoated bare zinc anode. Moreover, studies of the morphology and the reversibility on copper foil further affirm that the PANZ coating layer can promote the even electrodeposition of zinc ions and maintain high plating/stripping reversibility. The full battery with a PANZ@Zn anode has an excellent rate performance and a good cycling performance. The method proposed and the in‐depth understanding of the mechanism in the current work could represent a big step forward for zinc dendrite suppression and stimulate further efforts on zinc‐metal anodes and other aqueous metal‐ion batteries.</p>
