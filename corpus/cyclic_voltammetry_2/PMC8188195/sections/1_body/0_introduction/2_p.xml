<p>The dwindling resources of fossil fuel and accelerating climate change are leading to urgent renewable energy demands. Harvesting sustainable energy from wind, sunlight, tides, and waves offers a great opportunity to overcome the energy shortage and catastrophic climate change. Collection and storage of the energy from these intermittent renewable resources is an intractable problem.

 <sup>]</sup> Lithium‐based batteries (e.g., LIBs), which are among the most successful energy storage systems (EESs) in portable electronic devices such as laptops, smartphones, and wearable devices, have reached a bottleneck in aspect of large‐scale grids and electric vehicles due to the exhaustion of lithium resources (high cost) and the use of inherently flammable liquid organic electrolytes.

 <sup>]</sup> Aqueous batteries (ABs), as one of the most promising candidates for large‐scale EESs, have attracted the attention of researchers because of their low cost, environmental benignity, and safety.

 <sup>]</sup> Because zinc metal has the highest theoretical specific capacity (820 Ah kg
 <sup>−1</sup>) among multivalent ABs and the abundant zinc supply (cost‐effective), aqueous rechargeable zinc‐ion batteries (ARZIBs) have been extensively investigated in recent years.
