<p>Porous polymer coatings, a reasonable candidate to circumvent the abovementioned shortcomings, have rarely been reported because they are hydrophobic or water‐insoluble. Therefore, constructing hydrophobic polymer coating films with hydrophilic ion transit channels may be a useful solution to direct uniform deposition and control dendrite growth. Polyacrylonitrile (PAN), a widely used polymer, is used extensively as polymer matrix in LIB gel electrolytes, because of its chemical stability, excellent thermal stability, and high tensile strength and tensile modulus.

 <sup>]</sup> However, the application of PAN in ARZIBs has not been investigated widely, probably because of the hydrophobicity of PAN membranes. Therefore, partly hydrophilic modification of the PAN coating layer would be a worthwhile way to address the dendrite issue on the surfaces of zinc anodes.
