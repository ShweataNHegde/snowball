<p>In this work, we investigate a polymer coating layer for a dendrite‐free zinc anode, which is prepared by dropping a PAN solution containing zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate (Zn(TfO)
 <sub>2</sub>) onto zinc foil (PANZ@Zn). Due to the addition of Zn(TfO)
 <sub>2</sub>, the PAN coating layer combined with a zinc salt (PANZ) has excellent hydrophilicity, which dramatically reduces the interfacial resistance of the Zn anode. With microchannels in the polymer network and the complexation effect between Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> and the cyano groups (–CN), the PANZ coating layer does not only facilitate the uniform transport of dissolved Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> in the PANZ membrane but also drives the uniform electrodeposition of zinc metal. A symmetric battery with a PANZ@Zn anode displays stable cyclability for more than 1140 h with a fixed capacity of 1 mAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup>. The full battery coupled with Mn‐doped V
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>5</sub> (MnVO) exhibits better electrochemical performance than that of the bare Zn anode, even when ultrathin zinc foil (20 µm) was employed in the full batteries.
