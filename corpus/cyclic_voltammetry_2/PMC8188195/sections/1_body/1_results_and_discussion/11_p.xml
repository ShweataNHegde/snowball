<p>To further reveal the effect of the PANZ coating layer on the deposition of zinc ions on the metal substrate, we investigated the morphology changes of the Zn deposited on Cu and PANZ@Cu, respectively. A phenomenon similar to that occurring on zinc foil was observed: the zinc was not uniformly deposited on the copper foil, and glass fibers adhered to the copper foil (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2543-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). Many large‐sized nuclei and individual dendrites were observed after 1 h (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2543-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>), and the size and quantity of dendrites significantly increased after 2 h deposition (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2543-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>,
 <xref rid="advs2543-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">G</xref>). However, the deposition on PANZ@Cu is very uniform, and the PANZ coating remains intact (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2543-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3H</xref>,
 <xref rid="advs2543-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">I</xref>). After uncovering the PANZ coating, a flat and dendrite‐free surface was observed (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2543-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3J</xref>; and Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2543-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6A</xref>, Supporting Information), confirming that the PANZ coating does regulate the deposition of zinc metal. The cross‐section images of original PANZ@Cu (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2543-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6B</xref>, Supporting Information) and zinc deposited PANZ@Cu (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2543-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3K</xref>) show that the zinc deposition layer is uniform and dense, and the PANZ coating film remains intact. The EDS mapping further confirms the uniform deposition of zinc on PANZ@Cu (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2543-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6C</xref>, Supporting Information). Furthermore, the X‐ray diffraction (XRD) results also show that the zinc deposit between the PANZ layer and Cu foil is a dense layer (Figure
