<p>We also coated a PANZ coating layer on copper foil (PANZ@Cu) and tested two half cells (bare Zn||bare Cu and PANZ@Zn||PANZ@Cu) to investigate the effect of the PAN coating layer on the Coulombic efficiency (CE) of the zinc stripping/plating process and on the morphology of the deposited zinc (

 </xref>). The test was carried out by plating zinc (fixed areal capacity: 1 mAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup>) onto the Cu or PANZ@Cu substrate and then stripping to 1 V. The nucleation overpotential of PANZ@Cu (36 mV, Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2543-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>) is much lower than that of bare Cu (51 mV), which is due to the considerably increased number of active nucleation sites on PANZ@Cu. As displayed in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2543-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>,
 <xref rid="advs2543-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">C</xref>, the Zn||PANZ@Cu cell presents a very stable coulombic efficiency (CE) over 770 cycles (1440 h), with the average CE as high as 99.8% after the initial activation cycles. However, the voltage of the Zn||Cu cell showed sharp fluctuations after only 90 cycles (180 h) because of the internal short circuit in the cell caused by Zn dendrite formation.
