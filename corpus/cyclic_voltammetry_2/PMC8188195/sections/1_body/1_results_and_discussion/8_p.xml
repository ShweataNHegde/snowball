<p>These results confirm that the PANZ coating layer can improve the surface wettability of the zinc electrode, reduce the interfacial impedance, relieve the corrosion of zinc, and confine the zinc ion flux to inhibit the growth of zinc dendrite.

 <sup>]</sup> Based on the above results, we can depict schematically the zinc stripping/plating behavior on the surface of bare Zn and PANZ@Zn (FigureÂ 
 <xref rid="advs2543-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2K</xref>). The poor cycling performance of the bare zinc electrode is mainly due to its severe interfacial reaction with water or dissolved O
 <sub>2</sub> and the random deposition/stripping positions and the accumulation effect of zinc dendrite.

 <sup>]</sup> In contrast, benefiting from excellent flexibility and hydrophilicity, the PANZ coating layer can not only adapt to the volume changes during the processes of zinc deposition/stripping and contain dendrite formation, but also facilitates uniform electrodeposition.
