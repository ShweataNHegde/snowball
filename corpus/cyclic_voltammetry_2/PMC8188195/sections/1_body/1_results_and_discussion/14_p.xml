<p>The rate performance of the Zn||MnVO and PANZ@Zn||MnVO batteries were also tested at various current densities ranging from 0.5 to 5 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>. As shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2543-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>, the rate performance of PANZ@Zn||MnVO is better than that of Zn||MnVO. The full battery PANZ@Zn||MnVO delivers a high specific capacity of 373 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, 379, 340, 290, 254, and 220 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> at current densities of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. Even at a very high current density of 5 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>, the PANZ@Zn still displays a high discharge specific capacity of 170 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, reaching ≈45% capacity utilization. However, the discharge specific capacity of the Zn||MnVO battery is lower than that of the PANZ@Zn||MnVO battery when the current density is over 1 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>. The charge–discharge curves in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2543-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4C</xref> reveal that the PANZ@Zn||MnVO presents a smaller voltage hysteresis than Zn||MnVO, which can be attributed to the reduced interfacial impedance due to the improved wettability provided by introducing the PANZ coating layer.
