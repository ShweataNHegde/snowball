<p>MnVO cathodes were investigated to further evaluate the impact of the PANZ coating layer on the electrochemical performance of full batteries consisting of bare Zn||MnVO and PANZ@Zn||MnVO cells (

 </xref>). MnVO was employed as cathode material to assemble a full battery due to the excellent reversibility, good electronic conductivity, and high specific capacity. The MnVO cathode material was synthesized by the hydrothermal method. The SEM image (Figure
