<p>The PANZ coating layer on PANZ@Zn was peeled off to reveal the morphology change of the zinc metal, and the SEM image shows a smooth surface without dendrite (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2543-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>). The magnified SEM image in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2543-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2H</xref> shows that zinc was deposited orderly on the surface, indicating that the deposition behavior of Zn on the PANZ@Zn anode is different from that on its bare counterpart. The coating layer on the cycled PANZ@Zn anode was peeled off and then the “bare zinc” (denoted as PANZ@Zn‐2) was reassembled into a coin cell with fresh bare Zn and continuously cycled for another five cycles to further verify the function of the PANZ coating layer. The digital picture displays glass fiber sticking to the surface of the PANZ@Zn‐2 anode (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2543-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>, Supporting Information), and in the magnified SEM images (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2543-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2I</xref>,
 <xref rid="advs2543-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">J</xref>) many protruding dendrites can be seen on the surface. We also evaluated the anticorrosion capability of the PANZ‐coated zinc anode. The Tafel curves measured in 2 
 <sc>m</sc> Zn(TfO)
 <sub>2</sub> at a scan rate of 2 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup> show the more negative corrosion potential of PANZ@Zn (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2543-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>, Supporting Information), which implies that the PANZ coating layer can alleviate the hydrogen evolution reaction.
