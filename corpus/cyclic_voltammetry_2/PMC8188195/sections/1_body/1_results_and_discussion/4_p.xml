<p>Bare zinc suffers from dendrite formation during cycling, usually after just a few cycles. In a study of the morphologies of the different zinc anodes before and after cycling, an in‐depth analysis shows how the PANZ coating layer tackles the dendrite problem. After five cycles at a current density of 1 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup> with a capacity of 1 mAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup>, many dendrites were found on the surface of the Zn anode (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2543-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1I</xref>), and the dendrites had grown considerably and gradually gathered to form dendrite clusters after 15 cycles (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2543-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1J</xref>). Many glass fibers embedded in the dendrites indicate that the dendrites penetrated the glass fiber membrane (Figure
