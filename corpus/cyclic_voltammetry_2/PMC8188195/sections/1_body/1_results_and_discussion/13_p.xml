<p>The CV curves of the two batteries were recorded between 0.2 and 1.8 V versus Zn/Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> at a scan rate of 0.3 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup>. The two batteries, respectively, present two pairs of cathodic/anodic peaks located at 1.16/0.73 and 0.80/0.40 V (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2543-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>), corresponding to the zinc‐ion intercalation and deintercalation processes, respectively.

 <sup>]</sup> The CV curves of the MnVO cathode recorded at multiple scan rates (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2543-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9</xref>, Supporting Information) show that the cathodic peaks are shifted toward more negative values with increasing scan rate, and the anodic peaks are shifted more positively, which can be ascribed to polarization.
