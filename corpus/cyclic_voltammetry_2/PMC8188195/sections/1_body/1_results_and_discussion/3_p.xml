<p>Since the uneven wetting of electrolyte on the zinc anode is the crucial factor that triggers the nonuniform distribution of charge and the nonhomogeneous electrodeposition on the solid‐electrolyte interface, the hydrophilicity of these zinc anodes in relation to electrolyte (2 
 <sc>m</sc> Zn(TfO)
 <sub>2</sub>) was investigated by measuring dynamic contact angles in the ambient environment. The initial contact angle of uncoated zinc was ≈87°, it was reduced to 77.9° in the following 4 min and then remained unchanged even after 20 min (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2543-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>; and Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2543-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A</xref>, Supporting Information). In contrast, as illustrated in Figure

 <xref rid="advs2543-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">G</xref>; and Figure

 <xref rid="advs2543-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">C</xref> (Supporting Information), the contact angles of PAN@Zn and PANZ@Zn electrodes were reduced from ≈62.3° and ≈36.4° to 47.6° and 26.3° over 4 min, respectively. The distinct hydrophilicity improvement of PANZ@Zn is attributed to the microchannels formed by the introduction of Zn(TfO)
 <sub>2</sub>. It should be noted that the smaller contact angle of PAN@Zn than that of the bare Zn can be ascribed to the spreading of water on the PAN membrane.

 <sup>2+</sup> transport through the PANZ layer. The better wettability facilitates the even distribution of zinc‐ion flux on the zinc's surface during cycling, which reduces the ions’ motion resistance and promotes uniform zinc electrodeposition. The Nyquist curves of the impedance spectra of the different anodes before cycling reveal that the PANZ interfacial coating film significantly reduced the interfacial impedance of the zinc anode (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2543-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1H</xref>). As shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2543-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A</xref> (Supporting Information), the highest resistance among the three anodes, displayed by PAN@Zn, substantially confirms that the pure PAN membrane without any additives is pore‐free and ion‐blocking in aqueous systems.
