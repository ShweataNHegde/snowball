<p>The long‐term cycling stability of the full batteries was tested at 500 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup> (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2543-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). The battery with a bare Zn anode presented rapid capacity decay, and internal short circuit occurred at the 260th cycle (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2543-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10A</xref>, Supporting Information). The fast decaying cycling performance can be attributed to the continuous corrosion of the unprotected Zn anode and the continuous growth of dendrites.
