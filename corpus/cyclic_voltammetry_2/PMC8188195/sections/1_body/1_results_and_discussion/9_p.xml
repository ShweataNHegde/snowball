<p>To evaluate the plating/stripping stability of the bare Zn and PANZ@Zn anodes, we investigated the long‐term galvanostatic cycling performance of symmetrical cells at a current density of 1 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup> with fixed capacity of 1 mAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup>. As illustrated in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2543-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2L</xref>,
 <xref rid="advs2543-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">M</xref>, the voltage hysteresis of the Zn||Zn cell exceeds 100 mV, and internal short‐circuit signals (sudden voltage drops) were already observed after about 410 h. In contrast, the PANZ@Zn||PANZ@Zn cell has a stable voltage profile for 1145 h with only 75 mV voltage hysteresis. The performance of PANZ@Zn anode is superior to the most previous works. As summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="advs2543-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> (Supporting Information), some of previous zinc anodes presented excellent cycling stability under high current density, but the capacity of per cycle they delivered is too low to satisfy the practical application.
