 </xref> shows the morphologies, hydrophilicity, and electrochemical impendence spectroscopy (EIS) of different zinc anodes. In order to remove the zinc oxide passivation layer, the bare zinc metal was polished with sandpaper before use (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2543-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). As shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2543-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>, the surface of the zinc anode coating PAN layer without salt (aliased as PAN@Zn) looks smooth and dense, and is a little different from the surface of PANZ@Zn because of the microchannels formed in the film of PANZ@Zn (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2543-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>; and Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2543-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>, Supporting Information). The cross‐section scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of bare Zn, PAN@Zn, and PANZ@Zn shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2543-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> (Supporting Information) show that the pure PAN coating layer is a pore‐free dense layer, and some micropores can be found in the PANZ layer containing zinc salt after the Zn(TfO)
 <sub>2</sub> salt was partially removed by soaking in water for a few minutes. The energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy (EDS) of the Zn, C, N, S, and F elements confirms that the zinc salt in the PANZ coating layer is uniformly distributed (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2543-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>).
