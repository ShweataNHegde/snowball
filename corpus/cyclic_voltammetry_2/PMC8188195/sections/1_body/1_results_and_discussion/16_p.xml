<p>By comparison, the cycling stability and lifespan of the PANZ@Zn||MnVO battery is enhanced significantly, with high capacity retention (255 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>) after 500 cycles and a longer lifespan of over 1000 cycles, even with the 20 µm thickness zinc foil used here. The dynamic EIS analysis of full batteries with PANZ@Zn||MnVO and Zn||MnVO (Figure

The increase in impedance of Zn||MnVO with cycling confirms that the PANZ coating layer plays the key role of an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to maintain impedance stability during battery cycling.
