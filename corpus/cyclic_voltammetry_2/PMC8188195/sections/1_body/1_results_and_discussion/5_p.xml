<p>The cycling performance of a symmetrical cell with the PAN@Zn anode is shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2543-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3B</xref> (Supporting Information). The battery failed after working only 17 h because of an internal short circuit, with a bigger polarization than that of the bare Zn and PANZ@Zn. The zinc anode and separator of the failed PAN@Zn cell was disassembled for further investigation. Dendrites are evident on the edge of the zinc disk, which pierced into the glass fiber membrane and triggered the internal short circuit (Figure

 <xref rid="advs2543-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">K</xref>, Supporting Information). In contrast, the PANZ@Zn anode showed a smooth surface without dendrite formation after 15 cycles (Figure
