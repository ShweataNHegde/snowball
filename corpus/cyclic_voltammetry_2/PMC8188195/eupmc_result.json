zinc-metal-based batteries are an attractive alternative to lithium-ion batteries for grid-scale energy-storage systems because of their high specific capacity, low cost, eco-friendliness, and nonflammability. However, uncontrollable zinc dendrite growth limits the cycle life by piercing the separator, resulting in low zinc utilization in both alkaline and mild/neutral electrolytes. Herein, a polyacrylonitrile coating layer on a zinc anode produced by a simple drop coating approach to address the dendrite issue is reported. The coating layer not only improves the hydrophilicity of the zinc anode but also regulates zinc-ion transport, consequently facilitating the uniform deposition of zinc ions to avoid dendrite formation. A symmetrical cell with the polymer-coating-layer-modified Zn anode displays dendrite-free plating/stripping with a long cycle lifespan (>1100 h), much better than that of the bare Zn anode. The modified zinc anode coupled with a Mn-doped V<sub>2</sub> O<sub>5</sub> cathode forms a stable rechargeable full battery. This method is a facile and feasible way to solve the zinc dendrite problem for rechargeable aqueous zinc-metal batteries, providing a solid basis for application of aqueous rechargeable Zn batteries.", "affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Ecological Metallurgy of Multimetallic Minerals (Ministry of Education), School of Metallurgy, Northeastern University, Shenyang, 110819, China.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print-Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"grantId": "KYCX20_1072", "agency": "Jiangsu Provincial Innovation Foundation for Postgraduate", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "51425301", "agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "U1601214", "agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "ZK201717", "agency": "State Key Lab Research Foundation", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "ZK201805", "agency": "State Key Lab Research Foundation", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "2019-MS-129", "agency": "Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "2018YFB0104300", "agency": "National Key R & D Program of China", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "51974081", "agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "BK20200696", "agency": "Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province", "orderIn": "0"}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Zinc-ion Batteries", "Dendrite Suppression", "Polyacrylonitrile Coating", "Zinc Anodes"]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202100309"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8188195"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8188195?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2021-06-09", "firstIndexDate": "2021-06-10", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2021-06-18", "dateOfRevision": "2021-06-17", "electronicPublicationDate": "2021-03-30", "firstPublicationDate": "2021-03-30"}, "htmllinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8188195", "abstract": "Aqueous rechargeable zinc-metal-based batteries are an attractive alternative to lithium-ion batteries for grid-scale energy-storage systems because of their high specific capacity, low cost, eco-friendliness, and nonflammability.
