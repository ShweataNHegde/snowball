For comparison, we contrast the observed electrochemical behavior of our graphene electrodes with the behavior of widely used standard glassy carbon electrodes under the same conditions. We also explore how our graphene films can be decorated with metal (Zn) and metalloid (Ge) nanostructures by electrodeposition from DES electrolytes.

 </sup> We have chosen choline chloride/ethylene glycol (12CE) as an archetypal example of DES electrolytes. 12CE fulfills all criteria for technical applications. Its components are cheap and environmentally friendly, while the mixture is easy to prepare, and it shows the highest ionic conductivity at room temperature among such types of electrolytes.

 </sup> Consequently, 12CE probably is the most extensively studied DES for electrochemical applications.
