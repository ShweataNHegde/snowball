<p>The electrochemical behavior of a given material is however not universal but critically depends on the choice of the employed electrolyte. While the electrochemistry of graphene has to date been mostly studied in conventional aqueous and nonaqueous electrolytes,

 </sup> novel electrolytes with enhanced properties are continuing to emerge. A particularly prominent example of such a novel class of electrolytes is deep eutectic solvents (DESs). DESs are ionic liquid-like fluids, which consist of a eutectic mixture of Lewis or Brønsted acids and bases that can encompass a variety of anionic and/or cationic species.
