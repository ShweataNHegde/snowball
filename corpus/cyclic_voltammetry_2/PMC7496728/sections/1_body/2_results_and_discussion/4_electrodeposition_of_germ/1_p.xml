<p>Our results on Zn electrodeposition generally show that electrochemical deposition routes that require very negative potentials in 12CE are nonideal for monolayer graphene electrodes, because in parallel to metal deposition also graphene degradation readily occurs. Precursors in 12CE that require less negative potentials for deposition, however, may circumvent any graphene degradation. To test this hypothesis, we finally investigate deposition of Ge from TBAGeCl
 <sub>3</sub> in 12CE.
