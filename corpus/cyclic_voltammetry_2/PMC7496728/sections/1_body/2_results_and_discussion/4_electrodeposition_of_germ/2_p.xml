 </xref>a (red) we find that for TBAGeCl
 <sub>3</sub> in 12CE on graphene, the onset of reduction is at 0.115 V versus Zn/Zn

 </xref>b, this electrochemical behavior corresponds to successful Ge deposition on the graphene (here shown after potentiostatic Ge deposition at −0.3 V for 260 s). In contrast to the Zn deposition, no gradient in the amount of deposited Ge with respect to the macroscopic distance from the electrolyte meniscus is observed. Instead, we find the same Ge morphology near and far from the electrolyte meniscus. As seen in the SEM images in

 </xref>b, the Ge is composed of individual islands with lateral sizes ranging from ≈ 100 nm to ≈ 800 nm while having a rather uniform height of ≈ 50 nm (AFM in Supporting Information

Importantly, the Raman spectrum of the Ge-coated graphene electrode in

This indicates in agreement with our hypothesis that electrodeposition from 12CE at moderate cathodic potentials can readily be carried out on graphene without degradation of the graphene quality. The absence of a gradient in the Ge deposit homogeneity along the electrode length, combined with the retained high graphene quality observed in Raman after Ge deposition, corroborates our above suggestion that the defect formation in graphene at strongly cathodic potentials (as observed for potentiodynamic Zn deposition) is the compounding factor to cause a large enough 
 <italic>iR</italic> drop, which results in a macroscopic deposit gradient (as observed above for Zn). A second factor that affects the local current density during Ge deposition probably is the electric conductivity of germanium. In contrast to zinc, the conductivity of germanium is smaller by six orders of magnitude compared to that of the graphene monolayer.

 </sup> As a result, the local current density on the uncoated graphene area increases during the deposition, favoring two-dimensional growth of Ge with uniform thickness (Supporting Information
