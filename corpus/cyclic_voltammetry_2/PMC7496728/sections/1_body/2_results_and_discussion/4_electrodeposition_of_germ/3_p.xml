<p>The cyclic voltammogram for Ge electrodeposition on graphene (

 </xref>a, red) shows a steady increase of cathodic current and a nucleation overpotential/loop. In contrast, on glassy carbon (

 </xref>a, black) a clear reduction peak at 0.052 V vs Zn/Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> without significant nucleation overpotential is seen. This difference between the two electrode materials suggests that nucleation is more difficult on the graphene compared to the glassy carbon. This could be related to a higher nucleation barrier on the structurally highly defined graphene basal plane compared to the less defined glassy carbon surface.

Wrinkles are known to be preferred sites for nucleation of ad-deposits on graphene because of their higher electrochemical activity and surface energy compared to the graphene basal plane.

 </sup> Thereby our observations confirm that also for a DES such as 12CE grapheneâ€™s higher reactivity sites such as wrinkles show variations in their electrochemical properties compared to the graphene basal plane, which translate to spatial differences in electrodeposition.
