<p>The unique impact of the two-dimensional nature of graphene on electrochemistry is also corroborated when considering that in our experiments the generation of defects in graphene monolayers did not improve their electrochemical activity. Although defects might increase the density of electronic states at the Fermi level and thus the rate of heterogeneous electron transfer,

 </sup> negates this effect. This is in stark contrast to the commonly observed behavior for the graphene bulk analog HOPG, for which defect generation in the HOPG basal plane improves electrochemical activity.
