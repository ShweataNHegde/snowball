<p>We have recently studied the mechanism of zinc electrodeposition from ZnCl

 </sup> It has been found that Zn deposition from ZnCl
 <sub>2</sub> in 12CE is a two-step process that first requires the formation of a reducible zinc species via ligand exchange with cathodic decomposition products of 12CE. In the second step, these newly formed zinc species are reduced during the anodic return sweep affecting zinc deposition. The explanation for this two-step process is that the otherwise dominating tetrachlorozincate ion [ZnCl
 <sub>4</sub>]
 <sup>2–</sup> cannot be directly reduced within the potential window of 12CE. It was found that this process strongly depends on the electrode material and is additionally complicated by the blocking of the electrode at very cathodic potentials.
