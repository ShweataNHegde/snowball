<p>We note that on the lower third of the immersed graphene electrode below the electrolyte meniscus also signs of graphene delamination can be observed (Supporting Information

The key impact of in situ graphene degradation during the negative sweeps is finally also corroborated, when observing that the amount of deposited zinc on graphene decreases with the cathodic switching potential becoming more negative, as shown in

 </xref>a. The more negative the applied potential, the more the electrolyte is decomposed, which causes two opposing effects on the zinc deposition rate. On the one hand, the higher the decomposition rate of the electrolyte, the more reducible Zn species are formed from the decomposition products. A higher concentration of reducible Zn species will increase the Zn deposition rate during the anodic return sweep. The more reactive radical decomposition products are formed, on the other hand, the more defects are generated in the graphene, resulting in an increasing
