<p>In our case, the gradient of the current density is the result of a combination of several factors. Initially, the internal resistance in the graphene layer (see the

This gradient then is enhanced from cycle to cycle, because, on the one hand, zinc will be deposited on zinc, which has an electric conductivity more than 5 times higher than graphene.

 </sup> On the other hand, the conductivity of the uncoated graphene is diminished by the chemical attack of radical species generated by the cathodic decomposition of the DES toward the rather negative switching potential of âˆ’0.6 V.
