<p>Further insight into the build-up of the Zn layer on graphene can be obtained by studying the consecutive voltammetric cycles shown in

 </xref>b, where the zinc is not anodically stripped. In 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure

 </xref>b, the cathodic switching potential is set at âˆ’0.6 V, where the extent of electrolyte decomposition is not so large, and consequently, only little zinc is deposited in the first cycle. In turn, also graphene degradation is less severe, and the graphene electrode can be cycled several times without diminishing current densities. In doing so, we find that the deposition current increases from cycle to cycle, and with increasing cycle number, a deposition peak is not only observed on the anodic return sweep, but increasingly also on the cathodic forward sweep. Moreover, these peaks residing on an increasing background current develop a pronounced triangular shape from cycle to cycle. Such a triangular shape was previously found for Zn deposition from ZnCl

 </xref>b (green dashed). Thus, the data in 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>
 </xref>b evidence the changeover from a two-dimensional graphene electrode that with increasing Zn coverage becomes increasingly more similar to a bulk Zn electrode in its electrochemical properties in agreement with the previous observations for the zinc gradient (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure

 </xref>b). The shift of the peak maxima toward negative potentials with increasing peak current from cycle to cycle for the graphene electrode as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>
 </xref>b can be attributed to a slowly increasing
