<p>For the as-fabricated graphene electrodes that are subjected to a first positive sweep, the current only starts to rise above +2.2 V and decreases again during the return sweep (

 </xref>a, blue). This anodic behavior upon a first positive sweep is comparable to that of glassy carbon in 12CE (

 </xref>a, gray dashed). The rise in current above +2.2 V is probably due to the anodic oxidation of the chloride ions,

 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref>b shows the Raman spectrum of the once positively swept electrode (bottom blue). Notably, after anodic cycling up to +2.5 V, the Raman signature of the graphene electrodes remains virtually unchanged, suggesting that the graphene layer remains structurally fully intact during anodic cycling 12CE. Consistent with this, optical microscopy images of the graphene electrodes before and after anodic cycling show no observable change in terms of graphene film homogeneity and coverage from their as-prepared state as shown in
