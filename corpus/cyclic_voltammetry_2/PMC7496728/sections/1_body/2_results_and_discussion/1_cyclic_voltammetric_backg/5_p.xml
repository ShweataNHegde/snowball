<p>Electrochemical background cycling has revealed the stability limits of graphene in 12CE, whereby we find that graphene is electrochemically stable at positive potentials up to +2.5 V, while at potentials negative from approximately âˆ’0.5 V versus Zn/Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>, graphene degradation via radical formation from 12CE decomposition readily occurs.
