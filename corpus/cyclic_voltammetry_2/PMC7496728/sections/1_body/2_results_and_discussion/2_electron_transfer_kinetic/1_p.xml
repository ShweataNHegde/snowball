 </sup> This couple is known to undergo an outer-sphere one-electron transfer, that is, without strong interaction (bond formation) with the electrode material and is thus well suited for comparing the heterogeneous charge transfer rate at different electrode materials. Typical features of the cyclic voltammograms of this redox couple, such as the peak potentials and peak currents and their variation with the scan rate, can be used as diagnostic criteria to estimate the rate of heterogeneous charge transfer. If the charge transfer is fast on the timescale of the experiment (reversible or Nernstian system), the peak potentials should be independent of scan rate, and a peak potential difference, Δ

In this case, the reaction is diffusion controlled and the forward peak currents should be proportional to the square root of the scan rate. The linear regression of the corresponding plot should pass through the origin, and the diffusion coefficient can be calculated from the slope with the Randles–Sevcik equation (

 </sup> has argued that the contribution at edges and defects to the heterogeneous electron transfer rate is much higher than that at the basal plane for graphene. We note, however, that our measurement provides a mean value for which contributions from graphene’s basal plane, edges, and point defects cannot be differentiated. In agreement with the background experiments above, the graphene electrodes are not degraded by cyclic voltammetry of ferrocene up to anodic potentials of 2 V vs Zn/Zn

 </sup> This behavior for outer-sphere redox probes such as ferrocene has been suggested to be linked to the low density of electronic states at the Fermi level of graphene and of the basal plane of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG).
