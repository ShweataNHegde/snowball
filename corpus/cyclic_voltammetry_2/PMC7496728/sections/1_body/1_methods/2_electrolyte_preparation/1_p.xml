<p>The DES consisting of a 1:2 molar ratio of choline chloride and ethylene glycol (12CE) was prepared by first drying the choline chloride (99% Fluka) at 100 °C under reduced pressure (10
 <sup>–2</sup> mbar) in a Schlenk flask for ≥48 h. When the flask had cooled down close to room temperature, the flask was isolated from the vacuum pump and transferred to an argon-filled glovebox, where anhydrous ethylene glycol (99.8%, Aldrich) was added as supplied, without further drying. The mixture was stirred using a PTFE-coated magnetic stir bar until a single, colorless liquid phase was obtained.
