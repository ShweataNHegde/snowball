<p>Electrolytes containing ZnCl
 <sub>2</sub> were prepared similarly by adding predried powdered ZnCl
 <sub>2</sub> (99.999%, Aldrich, dried at room temperature at 10
 <sup>–2</sup> mbar for ≥48 h) to the 12 CE electrolyte. The solution was stirred until all of the salt had completely dissolved. Higher temperatures were avoided to limit reactions between ZnCl
 <sub>2</sub> and the hydroxyl group of the choline.
