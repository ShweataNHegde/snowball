<p>Electrochemical experiments were carried out in a three-electrode glass cell within a dry, argon-filled glovebox (MBraun, MB G-120) at 30 Â°C unless otherwise stated. The graphene on SiO
 <sub>2</sub>/Si was used as the working electrode with the graphene films immersed up to approximately half of their length. Because of the slightly varying immersion depths and slight variations in graphene film dimensions, the exact electroactive area and hence the absolute currents of the graphene electrodes used in this study vary to some extent. For reference, comparative measurements with a 3 mm diameter glassy carbon disk working electrode (Metrohm, 0.071 cm
 <sup>2</sup>, polished to a mirror finish with an aqueous slurry of alumina powder) and with a zinc disk electrode of 5 mm diameter were also made. The zinc disk was machined from a rod (99.999%, Goodfellow Cambridge Limited, UK) and inserted into an interchangeable rotating disk electrode tip holder with a polyether ether ketone shroud (Pine Research Instrumentation Inc., USA). Working electrodes were rinsed with deionized water and acetone and dried in air prior to their transfer into the glovebox.
