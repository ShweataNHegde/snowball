<p>A zinc wire immersed in 0.3 M ZnCl
 <sub>2</sub> was used as a reference electrode (RE) separated from the bulk electrolyte in the Haber–Luggin capillary via a glass frit. In some measurements, a Ag/Ag
 <sup>+</sup> (1 mM) RE separated from the bulk electrolyte in the Haber–Luggin capillary via a glass frit was used. The potentials in this paper are reported versus Zn/0.3 M Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> to allow easy comparison to our previous studies of ZnCl
 <sub>2</sub> in 12CE. They can be converted to the Ag/Ag
 <sup>+</sup> (1 mM) potential scale by subtracting 1.033 V. Platinum mesh was used as the counter electrode (CE).
