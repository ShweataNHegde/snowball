<p>The structural quality of the graphene films before and after all electrochemical measurements was assessed by Raman spectroscopy (all samples measured both in NT-MDT NTEGRA Spectra

 </sup> at 473 nm and in LabRAM HR at 633 nm laser wavelengths). Coverage and morphology of graphene films and, if present, Zn and Ge deposits before and after electrochemistry were studied by optical microscopy (Olympus), scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Zeiss Supra 55 VP, 2 kV, Everhart–Thornley secondary electron detector), and atomic force microscopy (AFM, Asylum Research Cypher, tapping mode, Olympus OMCL-AC240TS-R3 tips). Additional chemical and structural characterization of Zn and Ge deposits employed energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, FEI Quanta 250 FEG with EDAX SDD Octane Elite 55, 10 kV) and powder X-ray diffractometry (XRD, PANalytical XPert Pro MPD, Cu-Kα at 0.154 nm, θ-θ Bragg–Brentano geometry) including qualitative phase analysis by comparison to the International Centre for Diffraction Data (ICDD) using HighscorePlus software.
