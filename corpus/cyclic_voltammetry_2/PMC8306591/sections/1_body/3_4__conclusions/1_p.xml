<p>This work reports on the successful deposition of crystalline ZnO thin layer on an activated carbon substrate (electrode and powder) by controlling the pulse time of precursors and deposition temperature within the range of 70 and 150 °C. The Zn-based precursor’s pulse time is the most critical parameter and should be longer than 100 ms. Longer pulse time (for example, 400 ms) readily results in the formation of a crystalline ZnO and a lower impedance in EDLC cells. An ultrathin ZnO coating (6–20 cycles) is identified by XRD patterns, indicating that the crystalline phase enhances the electrochemical performance. The novel EDLC cells assembled with ZnO ALD coated AC electrodes demonstrated the enhanced cyclic capacitance retention (50%) under a higher operation voltage window (3.2 V) and the impedance reduction (3–10 Ohm). ZnO coating on powders before fabricating electrodes may improve the AC particle contact, leading to a lower impedance. Although the deposition of ZnO on AC has achieved significant improvements in electrochemical performance (such as impedance, electrochemical window, and capacity), it still requires further improvement in cycle life for future commercialization.</p>
