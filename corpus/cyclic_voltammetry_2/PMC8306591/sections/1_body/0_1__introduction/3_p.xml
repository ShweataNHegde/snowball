<p>Zinc oxide (ZnO) is a typical semiconducting material, which may accelerate ion transportation while acting as a protective layer on the electrodes compared to non-conductive aluminum oxide coating. Its semiconductor nature could be advantageous over the dielectric oxide in terms of low impedance and fast discharge, and possibly an additional capacitance may be harvested. The ZnO coating effect on electrochemical performance for different energy storage materials has been reported earlier [
