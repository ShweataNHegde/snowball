<p>Thin ZnO coating was applied on other non-carbon planar substrates extensively; such materials are sapphire, quartz, silicon, glass, borosilicate, and reviewed by Tynell and Karppinen [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-04188" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, ALD of ZnO has not shown much success on activated carbon electrodes for EDLC application. Here, in the current work, we explore the ALD of ZnO processed on AC electrodes and determine the experimental conditions enabling the enhancement of commercial YPâˆ’50 AC substrate. Therefore, we report here on an effective and most appropriate ALD process scheme enabling the fabrication of ZnO-coated AC nanostructures. The positive effect of ZnO ALD is pronounced by significantly improving the cycling retention of the EDLC cells when operated up to a voltage of 3.2 V.
