<p>As the conventional and traditional energy resources are depleting, there is an increasing need to develop renewable, low-cost, and efficient power and energy sources. To satisfy the needs of modern society, supercapacitors with fast charging/discharging rates, long cycle life, and high-power density attract worldwide research and commercial attention. An electrical double-layer capacitor (EDLC) is a common device showing great potential in fast energy discharge applications. However, the low operating voltages, high leakage current, and low energy density of supercapacitors limit their applications [
