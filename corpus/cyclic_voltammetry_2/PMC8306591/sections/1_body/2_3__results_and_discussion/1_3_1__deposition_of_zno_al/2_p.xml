<p>We first attempted to obtain a deposition of a ZnO thin layer on a tortuous AC substrate at various temperatures. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04188-f002">Figure 2</xref>a depicts XRD results of ALD ZnO deposition at 120 °C using 100 ms pulse time for DEZ. With an increase in the ALD cycles from 2 to 6, one can see in the 2θ spectrum no ZnO peak formation, except the carbon and aluminum substrate peaks. Increasing the number of ALD cycles to 20 results in a broad XRD signal between 30 and 40 degrees, indicating ZnO’s appearance, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04188-f002">Figure 2</xref>b. Yet, the deposited material does not grow into the crystalline ZnO phase, using the same pulsing time (100 ms).
