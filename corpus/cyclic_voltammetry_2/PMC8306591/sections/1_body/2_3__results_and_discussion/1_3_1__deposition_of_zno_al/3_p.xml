<p>Following that, we increased the pulse time of the DEZ precursor to 400 ms. We observed the formation of clear crystalline peaks for the same number of ALD cycles and deposition temperature. These peaks between 2θ angle of 30 and 40° are labeled as (100), (002), (101) and marked inside the dashed green square (

The appearance of the crystalline phase at the lower deposition temperature is attributed to the extended pulse time for ZnO ALD coating on AC electrodes. When using 400 ms, it turns out that even at 7-ALD cycles at the same deposition temperature (150 °C), the ZnO phase is already apparent, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04188-f002">Figure 2</xref>c. Increasing the cycle numbers to 20 and 50 under these conditions further sharpen the ZnO peaks, indicating a complete crystallization of the ZnO phase. These crystalline peaks do not change much when decreasing the deposition temperature from 150 to 70 °C. Therefore, a crystalline ZnO phase can be formed on AC electrodes using 400 ms for several ALD cycles at temperatures as low as 70 °C.
