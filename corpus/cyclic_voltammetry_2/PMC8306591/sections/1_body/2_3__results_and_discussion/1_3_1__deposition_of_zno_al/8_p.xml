<p>As is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04188-f006">Figure 6</xref>, more ALD cycles lead to the introduction of C=O and O-C=O bonds. Accordingly, the AC electrode coated with 20-cycle ZnO gives rise to higher capacitance and longer charge-discharge time than AC coated with 2-cycles ZnO. This difference may be associated with the active sites and better ionic mobility provided by oxygen functional groups.
