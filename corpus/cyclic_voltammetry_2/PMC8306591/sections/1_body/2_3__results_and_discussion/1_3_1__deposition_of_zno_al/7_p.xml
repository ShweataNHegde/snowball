<p>XPS technique was used to reveal the surface elemental composition and oxygen content on the AC electrodes coated with 2-cycle ZnO and 20-cycle ZnO at 70 Â°C. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04188-f006">Figure 6</xref>a,b show the typical Zn peaks (Zn2p1/2 and Zn2p3/2), direct evidence of the presence of ZnO even at the early stage of phase formation as indicated in the XRD pattern (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04188-f002">Figure 2</xref>a). Additional coating cycles do not show the change in Zn duplet peaks; however, more carbon-oxygen bonds are generated, indicating increased oxygen content. The relevant peaks can be de-convoluted into three peaks of C=O (531.5 eV), C-O (532.6 eV), and O-C=O (533.7 eV), respectively. At 2-cycle coating, C-O is the dominant bond, and the other two are not detected. However, in the 20-cycle coating, the peak becomes much wider, and other peaks can be de-convoluted, evidence that oxygen is extensively involved in ZnO crystalline phase.
