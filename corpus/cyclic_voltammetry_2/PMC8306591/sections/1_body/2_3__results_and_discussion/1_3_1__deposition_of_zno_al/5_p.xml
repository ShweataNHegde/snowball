<p>To confirm the formation and existence of ZnO on the AC substrates, we analyzed these samples using HRTEM and EDS. The detailed characterization is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04188-f004">Figure 4</xref>, illustrating the uneven and rough AC surface. Bare AC is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04188-f004">Figure 4</xref>a–c, and 2-cycle ZnO samples in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04188-f004">Figure 4</xref>d–f do not present much difference. For 20-cycle ZnO, dark-colored fringes on the edges of the AC particles are observable at different locations (as marked with arrows), indicating most probably the presence of ZnO coating on the AC surface.
