<p>The deposition of ZnO via the ALD technique may end up at amorphous and crystalline structures depending on the processing conditions. Previous reports emphasized the importance of ALD deposition temperatures when using various substrates, and reported on the temperature dependence of ZnO phase formation, O/Zn ratio, and resistivity [
