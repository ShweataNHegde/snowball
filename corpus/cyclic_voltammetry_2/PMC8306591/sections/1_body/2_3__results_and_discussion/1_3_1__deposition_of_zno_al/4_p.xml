<p>SEM images presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04188-f003">Figure 3</xref> illustrate the coated AC particle morphology after fabricating on an aluminum foil electrode. There are bulk structures and small particles between them in each image, probably the carbon black and PVDF binder. A similar morphology in all samples being deposited with 20-cycle ZnO was obtained, and no observable alteration in the AC electrode microstructure was detected.
