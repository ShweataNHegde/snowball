 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04188-f007">Figure 7</xref>c, 20-cycle ZnO-coated samples have a longer charge-discharge time when charging to 3.2 V, meaning its higher capacitance than the other three materials. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04188-f007">Figure 7</xref>e presents electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) data comparison between the ZnO-coated and pristine uncoated samples. It is easy to relate it to the result that the coated samples have lower impedance, and the trend is identical to the performance in the C-V behavior. The self-discharge behavior is also studied for all the samples, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04188-f007">Figure 7</xref>f. An open-circuit voltage was used for 12 h after charging at a constant voltage of 3.2 V for 1 h. As observed from the curves, the voltage of 6-cycle coated samples decreases slowly due to time. The 6-cycle coated samples still maintain 2V after 10,000 s, followed by the 20-cycle coated sample.
