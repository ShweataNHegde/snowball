<p>The increased capacitance by applying ZnO coating is attributed to the maintenance of the high surface area of AC. ALD coating of fewer than 20 cycles is still thin enough in comparison with the micropore structure. The DFT and HK methods from N
 <sub>2</sub> adsorption-desorption isotherms reveal the surface area and porosity of pristine and ZnO-coated AC electrodes. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04188-f008">Figure 8</xref> shows a minor loop for both the bare and ZnO-coated AC samples indicating the existence of mesopores and negligent difference in terms of pore size distribution. In other words, conformal ZnO coatings at 70 Â°C and 100 ms are realized and do not block the micropores on the electrode surfaces.
