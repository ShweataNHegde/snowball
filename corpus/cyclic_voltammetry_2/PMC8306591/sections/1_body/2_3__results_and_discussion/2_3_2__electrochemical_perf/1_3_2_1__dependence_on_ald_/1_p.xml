<p>The electrochemical performance of bare AC and ZnO-coated AC electrodes was first initiated with those using the pulse time of 100 ms. The symmetric coin cells are fabricated using TEABF
 <sub>4</sub>/acetonitrile electrolyte for various tests. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04188-f007">Figure 7</xref>a depicts the cyclic voltammetry of the electrodes with different coating thicknesses. Up to 2.7 V, all samples show a square-like shape without much distortion. Like the 2-cycle coated material, 6-cycle ZnO-coated AC delivers the best performance, albeit both give rise to a higher capacitance than bare AC. Further evaluation of the 20 cycles ZnO present an opposite trend: the capacitance now turns to a lower value. This result shows that a suitable thin coating contributes to the capacitance in EDLC more significantly. Too thick ZnO coating using the pulse time of 100 ms is not favorable in terms of the C-V loop area.

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04188-f007">Figure 7</xref>c, 20-cycle ZnO-coated samples have a longer charge-discharge time when charging to 3.2 V, indicating its higher capacitance compared with the other three materials. The GCD curves of 6-cycle ZnO coating at various current densities exhibit the typical triangular shape with high linearity and symmetry, illustrating the excellent charge and discharge reversibility of ALD ZnO-coated samples
