<p>We studied the relationship between the electrochemical performance and ZnO phase formation on AC using a longer pulse time (400 ms). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04188-f009">Figure 9</xref>a reveals the 3V C-V loop of AC electrodes coated with 20-cycle ZnO using 400 ms at 150 °C. The ALD cycle number does not show different results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04188-f009">Figure 9</xref>b). However, coating at 150 °C results in a higher capacitance than those at 70 °C. The long pulsing time also benefits their impedance behavior. At 400 ms pulse time, all the ZnO-coated AC electrodes, irrespectively of the number of ALD cycles and ALD temperature, showed lower charge transfer resistance (R
 <sub>ct</sub>) values than the pristine bare AC (9.1 Ω). The R
 <sub>ct</sub> values of the 6- and 20-cycle ALD coated electrodes at 150 °C were found to be 4.3 Ω and 2.3 Ω, respectively, whereas at 70 °C, the R
 <sub>ct</sub> values were 4.3 Ω and 2.3 Ω, respectively. The Lower R
 <sub>ct</sub> at 150 °C in comparison to 70 °C can be attributed to the minimal differences in the extent of crystalline ZnO phase formation, affecting the ion migration rate at the electrode and electrolyte interface. Such behavior is also observed in ZnO nanoparticle-decorated bacterial nanowires. [
