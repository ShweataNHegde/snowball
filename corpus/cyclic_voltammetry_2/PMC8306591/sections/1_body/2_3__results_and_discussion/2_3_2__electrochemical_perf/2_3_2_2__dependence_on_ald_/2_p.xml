<p>ALD ZnO coating also benefits the cycling retention of the AC-based supercapacitors operating at higher voltages. This characteristic is desirable since a device using TEABF
 <sub>4</sub> electrolyte cannot be used at 3.2 V, due to the severe electrolyte degradation initiated at the AC-electrolyte interface. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04188-f009">Figure 9</xref>d summarizes the cyclic life of the bare AC and AC samples coated at different conditions. When cycling at 3.2 V and 50 mA, the bare AC electrodes perform poorly, failing quickly after 1000 cycles. On the other hand, the AC electrodes coated with ZnO exhibit a significant improvement in retention at similar testing conditions. In particular, 20-cycle ALD ZnO at 70 to 150 Â°C for 400 ms performs better in cycling retention. Yet, the cyclic capacitance stability remains to be further improved from 60 to 90%.
