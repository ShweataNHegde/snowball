<p>Overall, the lower impedance values for ZnO-coated AC electrodes compared with the pristine uncoated AC (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-04188-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) implies the enhanced electron/ion diffusion rate across the interface. The ZnO coating cycles or thickness should be minimal when depositing at a lower temperature (70 °C) for a shorter pulse time (100 ms) since 20-cycle coating causes a higher impedance than 2-cycle coating. One may understand this phenomenon based on the intrinsic n-type conductivity originated from Zn interstitials and impurities in the ZnO crystal. Increasing the ALD deposition temperature up to 220°C generally decreases the resistivity and the stoichiometry of the ZnO film. Thus, it also results in lower resistivity (~10
 <sup>−3</sup> Ω cm) than the pristine AC materials [
