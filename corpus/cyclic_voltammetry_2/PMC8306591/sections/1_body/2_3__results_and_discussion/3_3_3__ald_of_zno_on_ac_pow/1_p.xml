<p>The reduction in impedance by applying ALD of ZnO at 20 cycles for 400 ms at 150 °C is now being applied and tested to ALD of ZnO on AC powder before electrode fabrication. We aimed to understand better the impact of the ALD processing sequence on the overall impedance of the cells. The impedance of the coated AC powder-based EDLC is also apparently reduced compared with the ALD of the composite AC electrodes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04188-f010">Figure 10</xref>). After 5000 charge-discharge cycles at 3.2 V, the cells comprising AC powders coated with ALD of ZnO only show a minor increase in the impedance: from 9 to 15 Ω; whereas the cells containing ALD coated composite AC electrodes exhibit a significant increase in the impedance. It can be attributed to homogeneous and complete (and possibly compact) ZnO coverage on the AC powder.
