<p>The electrochemical performance of the AC and ALD ZnO-coated AC electrodes were evaluated based on a symmetrical supercapacitor device with CR2032 coins. The cyclic voltammetry and Galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) measurements between 2 to 50 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup> using the Gamry electrochemical workstation (Interface 1010E, USA). EIS data were recorded with 5 mV amplitude potential within a 10 kHz−0.01 Hz frequency range.
