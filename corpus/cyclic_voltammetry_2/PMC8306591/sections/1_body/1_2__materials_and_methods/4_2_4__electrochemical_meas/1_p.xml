<p>YP−50F AC powder (~85%), super P carbon black (~10%), and polyvinylidene difluoride (~5%) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone solution were mixed for 10 min in a vacuum mixer for a homogeneous slurry. The slurry was loaded onto Al foil and spread using the doctor blade technique to form a film. This film was vacuum dried at 120 °C for 12 h and then pressed at 10 MPa to form a dense electrode sheet. Afterwards, the electrode sheet was cut into disks of 1.12 cm
 <sup>2</sup> using a disk cutter (MSK-T10).
