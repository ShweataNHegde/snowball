<p>AC powders used in this work were YP−50F (Kuraray), and PVDF binders and carbon black were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. AC electrodes were fabricated on Al foils using the doctor blade casting technique with an automatic thin-film coater (MTI corporation, Hefei, China). A 35-μm thick cellulose NKK TF4035 of 75% porosity (Nippon Kodoshi, Kochi, Japan) was used as a separator. The electrolyte salt TEABF
 <sub>4</sub> (Sigma Aldrich) was placed in a glove box filled with high purity argon (&lt;0.01 ppm O
 <sub>2</sub> and &lt;0.01 ppm H
 <sub>2</sub>O), then dissolved in the Acetonitrile (AN) in a concentration of 1 mol/L.
