<p>The AC electrodes were fixed onto a silicon wafer with Kapton tapes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-04188-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Each ALD process was conducted in the chamber set at 70, 120, and 150 Â°C separately and a constant argon flow rate of 10 sccm was applied. The pulse time was 400 ms, and purge time was 10 s in each deposition cycle. Detailed parameters of the different ALD depositions are shown in
