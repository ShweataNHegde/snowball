<p>The typical growth rate for the film is 0.5–1.5 Å per cycle for zinc oxide material. The reaction sequence within each deposition cycle was: (i) exposure of the substrate to DEZ; (ii) purge to remove the un-reacted precursors and the byproducts; (iii) exposure of the substrate to H
 <sub>2</sub>O; (iv) purge to remove the un-reacted precursors and the byproducts detailed by Song et al. [
