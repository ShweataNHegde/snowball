<p>In summary, the electropolymerization of SPAPE polymer electrolyte into carbon nanotubes has been conducted by cyclic voltammetry. The enhanced electrochemical performance of SPAPE-coated CNT compared to pristine ones, due to the high electrode/electrolyte interface area leads to the improved charge transfer. In addition, this study also clearly showed the positive effect of direct pre-lithiation to suppress the initial irreversible capacity of CNT. Light-weight free-standing and flexible CNT without any binder and conductive additives have been successfully utilized as anode materials in Li-ion batteries, demonstrating both a stable and a high reversible capacity of 508 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> (187 μAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup>) at a 10 C rate over 500 cycles. Pre-lithiation of CNT via a self-discharge mechanism improves the first cycle coulombic efficiency from 11.57% to 68.30% after 15 min pre-lithiation period and reaches &gt;100% subsequent to 30 min of pre-lithiation period. Moreover, by coupling the CNT anode with a high voltage LNMO spinel cathode, a 3.75 V full-cell presented a high capacity of 238 μAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup> at a 1 C rate with the coulombic efficiency of ca. 90% in the initial cycle. This simple, fast and inexpensive method enables the achievement of high capacity flexible anodes for micro-batteries.
