<p>The surface morphology of the CNT anode was examined using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, Ultra-55, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Tecnai G2, Thermofisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, US). The purity of CNT was examined by x-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Diffractometer D5000 (Siemens, Munich, Germany) with CuK
 <sub>α1</sub> (λ= 1.5406 Å) radiation, then analyzed by comparing with the JCDS-ICDD database (Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards - International Center for Diffraction Data) to check the purity of the samples. Raman spectra were recorded with XploRA Raman spectrometer (Horiba Scientific, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a 532 nm laser. For the electrochemical performance tests, Pristine CNT and SPAPE-coated CNT having a surface area of 0.44 cm
 <sup>2</sup> were used as electrodes without the use of any binders and conductive additives, assembling using standard two-electrode Swagelok cells. All cells assembly were conducted in a glove box, filled with high purity argon (Ar) in which the moisture and oxygen contents were less than 2 ppm. Cyclic voltammetry tests were carried out using a VMP3 (Bio Logic, Seyssinet-Pariset, France) in the potential window of 0.01–2 V vs. Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup> with a scan rate of 0.2 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup>. Galvanostatic charge–discharge cycles were performed with a VMP3 (Bio Logic) in the potential window between 0.01 and 2 V vs. Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup> and the current density for the CNT electrodes (pristine and pre-lithiated) were 0.12, 0.24, 0.60, 1.20, 1.8, and 3.6 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup>, respectively. The pristine CNT–LNMO and pre-lithiated CNT-LNMO full-cells were cycled at 1C and 2C rate in the potential window of 2.5–4.4 V.
