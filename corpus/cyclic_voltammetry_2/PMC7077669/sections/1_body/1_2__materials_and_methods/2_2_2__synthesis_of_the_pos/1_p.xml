 <sub>4</sub> (LNMO) serving as cathode was synthesized by a sol–gel method as described in [
 <xref rid="B46-polymers-12-00406" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. To prepare the composite cathode, LNMO powder was mixed with carbon black (Super P) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) at the ratio of 80:10:10 and ground in a mortar for 20 min.
 <sc> n-</sc>Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) was added in the powder mixture to obtain a paste. The paste was subsequently spread on an aluminum disk as current collector with a diameter of 8 mm. The electrode was dried at 80 °C and was kept under vacuum at 110 °C for 10 h.
