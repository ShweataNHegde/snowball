<p>The metallic Cu thin film was deposited onto the CNT surface utilizing a Cu target by radio frequency sputtering (MP300 model, PLASSYS, Marolles en Hurepoix, France), as described in our previous work [
 <xref rid="B33-polymers-12-00406" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The 300 nm-thin layer of sputter-deposited Cu film was utilized as the backside connection of the electropolymerization reaction. Electropolymerization of the SPAPE polymer electrolyte onto CNT was conducted by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a three-electrode electrochemical cell using a VersaSTAT 3 potentiostat (Princeton Applied Research, Elancourt, France) with a Pt electrode as the counter and Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) as the reference electrode [

 <sup>−3</sup> M of the synthesized monomer was mixed with 0.5 M LiTFSI as a supporting electrolyte and DMSO as a solvent. The CV experiments were carried out at room temperature for 10 cycles at the scan rate of 20 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup> in the potential window of −0.9 to −1.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl). After electropolymerization, a simple pre-lithiation treatment was achieved by pressing a Li foil and the CNT soaked with 2 drops of electrolyte composed of 1 M LiPF
