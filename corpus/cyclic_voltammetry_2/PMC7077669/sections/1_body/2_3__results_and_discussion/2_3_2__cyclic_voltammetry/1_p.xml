<p>In the present study, we implemented a direct pre-lithiation method in order to suppress the irreversible capacity loss during the formation of SEI film in the first cycle [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-00406-f003">Figure 3</xref>a. The CNT were directly contacted with a Li metal film in a small amount of electrolyte. Hence, a self-Li-ion discharging process (lithiation) occurs due to the short being made; the different potential existing between CNT materials and Li metal becoming reduced to zero potential. In order to follow the effect of the pre-lithiation process at various contact times (1, 3, 15, and 30 min), we first investigated the electrochemical behavior of the pristine CNT and pre-lithiated CNT electrodes by comparing the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves, as displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-00406-f003">Figure 3</xref>bâ€“f). It is clearly observed that prior to pre-lithiation, the CV curve exhibits an open circuit voltage (OCV) of ~3.1 V vs. Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup> and this would correspond to a purely delithiated state. During the first cycle, an obvious cathodic peak around 0.6 V attributed to the electrolyte decomposition is easily observed and corresponds to the formation and deposition of a SEI layer [

 <sup>+</sup> intercalation into CNT and oxidation peak located at 0.25 V corresponds to the Li
 <sup>+</sup> extraction process [
 <xref rid="B21-polymers-12-00406" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The broad oxidation peak ca. 1.25 V is also visible, corresponding to the extraction of Li ions from the cavities existing in the CNT structure and the small oxidation peak ca. 1.8 V might be ascribed to the reaction of lithium with hydrogen functional groups on the CNT surfaces [
