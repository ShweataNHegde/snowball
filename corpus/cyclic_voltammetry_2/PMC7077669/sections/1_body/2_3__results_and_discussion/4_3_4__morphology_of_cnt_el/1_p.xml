<p>SEM images show the influence of direct pre-lithiation on the CNT surface morphology. The significant change of the morphology occurred, as displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-00406-f005">Figure 5</xref>. After a very short contact time (1 min pre-lithiation), the bundled and densified morphology of CNT is preserved with only a few modifications of the CNT surfaces (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-00406-f005">Figure 5</xref>a,b). Surface examination is continued for 15 min pre-lithiation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-00406-f005">Figure 5</xref>c,d), where the CV curves and galvanostatic cycling results support a stable SEI film formation, being pre-formed on the CNT surface upon self-discharge. Interestingly, and as expected, a polymer-like film covering the CNT surface can be assigned to the growth of the SEI thin film. After a 15 min pre-lithiation process, (CH

 <sub>2</sub>O, etc. products are presumably accumulated over the CNT surface due to the insertion and absorption of the Li ions into the CNT structures, in addition to the electrolyte reduction [
