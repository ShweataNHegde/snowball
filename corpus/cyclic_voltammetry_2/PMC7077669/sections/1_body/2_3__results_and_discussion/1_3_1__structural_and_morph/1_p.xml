<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-00406-f001">Figure 1</xref>a, the Raman spectrum of the CNT exhibits the two main bands characteristic of carbon materials in general, and to CNT in particular [
 <xref rid="B48-polymers-12-00406" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="B49-polymers-12-00406" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The G band (1573 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) is correlated with the stretching of the C–C bond (sp
 <sup>2</sup>), and the D band (1341 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) is attributed to the presence of disorders in the sp
 <sup>2</sup> structure. The ratio between these two peaks (I
 <sub>D</sub>/I
 <sub>G</sub>) is often used to assess the relative content of defects in the CNT. The low D band intensity of the CNT used in this work (I
 <sub>D</sub>/I
 <sub>G</sub> = 0.21 ± 0.02) indicates its relative purity. The crystallinity of the CNT was verified using X-ray diffraction and the patterns are given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-00406-f001">Figure 1</xref>b. Two distinguishable diffraction peaks are clearly seen: a strong C (002) peak at approximately 26° represents the characteristic of graphite peak and the peak at approximately 43° is attributed to the (100) planes of the nanotube structure.
