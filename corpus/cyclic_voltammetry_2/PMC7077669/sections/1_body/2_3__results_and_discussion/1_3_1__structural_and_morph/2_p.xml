<p>According to the SEM examinations, the pristine CNT are present as highly disoriented shaped nanotubes with diameters ranging from approximately 5 to 30 nm as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-00406-f002">Figure 2</xref>a,b. After electropolymerization, densified and bundled CNT are obtained due to Van-der-Waals interactions among the neighboring tubes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-00406-f003">Figure 3</xref>c,d). Moreover, we also observed that the electropolymerization process allows the densified and bundled CNT formation due to an interaction existing between the neighboring tubes [
 <xref rid="B33-polymers-12-00406" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The presence of nanoparticles attached on the pristine CNT surfaces is detected from the SEM and TEM images which is assumed to be a catalyst residue of metal impurities resulting from the synthesis process. The elemental energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis spectra shows the presence of Fe particles which are attributed to the catalyst impurities and the Cu signal came from the Cu grid.
