<p>The promising performances of the CNT suggested their use as potential flexible anode material for application in full lithium-ion batteries using high-voltage cathode material, i.e., LNMO, in order to achieve high energy density. The galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles of the full-cell battery using both pristine CNT and pre-lithiated CNT as anodes are presented in the 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-00406-f008">Figure 8</xref>. The battery was cycled at 1 C in the potential window of 2.5–4.4 V. Since the mass limitation is controlled by CNT, the capacity is reported versus the anode material and the mass was calculated considering a porosity of 70%. In the first cycle, the pristine CNT cell exhibits an initial charge capacity of 1856 μAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup> and a discharge capacity of 76 μAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup> with a relatively low coulombic efficiency of ca. 4.1% (
