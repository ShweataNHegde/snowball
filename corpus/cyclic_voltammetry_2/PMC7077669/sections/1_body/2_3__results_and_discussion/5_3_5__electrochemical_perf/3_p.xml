<p>To further examine the rate capability performance of the pre-lithiated CNT electrodes, galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling was carried out at progressively increased current density, ranging from 0.12 to 3.6 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup>. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-00406-f007">Figure 7</xref>a,b shows the galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles of the pre-lithiated CNT with polymer coating at a potential range of 0.01–2 V at 1 C for 50 cycles. After 50th cycle the coulombic efficiency reaches approximately 93%, corresponding to a charge capacity of 792 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> (291 μAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup>) and the discharge capacity is 850 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> (313 μAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup>) at 1 C. Their reversible capacity is &gt;2-fold higher compared to the storage capacity of graphite (372 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>). We note that capacity fading occurs in the few initial cycles which could possibly due to the defects on CNT, impurities and irreversible lithium loss due to the side reactions upon cycling. However, the capacity is stabilized after 10 cycles and compared to pristine CNT which showed a severe capacity decay (~10 times) [
