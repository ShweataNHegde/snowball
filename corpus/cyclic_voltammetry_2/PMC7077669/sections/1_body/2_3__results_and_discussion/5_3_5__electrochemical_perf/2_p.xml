<p>By comparing the 1st and 2nd discharge capacity of both pristine and pre-lithiated samples, the importance of direct pre-lithiation prior to cell assembling can be demonstrated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-00406-f006">Figure 6</xref>a,b). For the non-pristine CNT, the 1st and 2nd discharge capacity of the pristine CNT are 4298 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> (1581 μAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup>) and 681 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> (251 μAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup>), while SPAPE-coated CNT provides 1st discharge capacity of 6699 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> (2465 μAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup>) and 2nd discharge capacity of 955 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> (351 μAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup>). Both pristine samples exhibited very high initial capacity loss. This irreversible capacity is considered as a critical issue, notably when assembling a full-cell configuration, since lithium is irreversibly consumed after the first lithiation. In agreement with previous findings [

 <xref rid="B54-polymers-12-00406" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,
 <xref rid="B58-polymers-12-00406" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], the high capacity loss can be significantly reduced after pre-lithiation. For the pre-lithiated CNT, the 1st and 2nd discharge capacity of the pristine CNT are 286 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> (97 μAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup>) and 861 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> (317 μAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup>), while SPAPE-coated CNT gives 1st discharge capacity of 981 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> (361 μAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup>) and 2nd discharge capacity of 1188 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> (437 μAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup>). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-00406-f006">Figure 6</xref>c–f show the charge and discharge profiles of the CNT anodes under four fabrication conditions: pristine CNT, SPAPE-coated CNT, pre-lithiated pristine CNT and pre-lithiated SPAPE-coated CNT, respectively. The charge and discharge profiles for all samples show pronounced sloping curves, with a cell voltage of ~0.5 V vs. Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup>. Moreover, the overlapping of the galvanostatic curves suggests a good electrochemical reversibility of the CNT anode, particularly after direct pre-lithiation.
