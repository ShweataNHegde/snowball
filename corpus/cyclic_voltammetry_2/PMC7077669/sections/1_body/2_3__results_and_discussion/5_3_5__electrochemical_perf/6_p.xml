<p>In contrast, as seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-00406-f008">Figure 8</xref>b, the pre-lithiated CNT cell gives a superior electrochemical performance, delivering a discharge capacity of 238 μAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup> with a cell voltage of about 3.75 V at 1 C. Another crucial point is that the OCV for the pristine CNT starts from ca. 0 V, while the OCV of the pre-lithiated CNT is ca. 4.2 V which means the SEI layer has been pre-formed on the CNT surface. For the pristine CNT, the capacity decreases 42% after 10th cycle at 1 C. The reason for this is likely ascribed to the relatively low coulombic efficiency of the pristine CNT in the half-cell (11.57%). At 2 C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-00406-f008">Figure 8</xref>c), the pre-lithiated CNT reaches capacity of 223 μAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup>. The important differences between pristine CNT and pre-lithiated CNT became obvious after 10 cycles charge–discharge cycling as seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-00406-f008">Figure 8</xref>d. In the full-cell configuration, the capacity of pre-lithiated CNT is 4 times higher compared to pristine CNT.
