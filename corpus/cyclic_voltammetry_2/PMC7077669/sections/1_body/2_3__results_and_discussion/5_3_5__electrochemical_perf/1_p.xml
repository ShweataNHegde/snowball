<p>To verify the significant role of pre-lithiation prior to cell assembling and their functionalization with the polymer coating, four CNT electrodes were charged and discharged in the range of 0.01–2 V vs. Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup> to evaluate their cycle life. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-00406-f006">Figure 6</xref>a shows the comparison of the pristine and pre-lithiated CNT. As seen, for all samples, the CNT anodes show good cycling stability, even up to 500 cycles. For the pristine CNT samples, SPAPE-coated CNT attains higher reversible capacity of 463 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> (170 μAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup>) compared to pristine CNT (242 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, 89 μAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup>), while for the pre-lithiated samples, the pristine CNT and SPAPE-coated CNT yielded a reversible capacity of 356 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> (131 μAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup>) and 508 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> (187 μAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup>), respectively over 500 cycles at 10 C rate (

 <xref rid="B57-polymers-12-00406" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The enhancement can be attributed to the combination of two effects: the larger electrode/electrolyte interface resulting in improved charge transport and a better penetration of the polymer electrolyte onto the carbon nanotube surfaces [
 <xref rid="B33-polymers-12-00406" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The fact that SPAPE can improve the kinetics of charge/discharge has been evidenced by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in one of our previous works [
