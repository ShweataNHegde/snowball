Indeed, when the current density turned back from high to low current densities, the capacity can be greatly recovered over 120 cycles. Herein, we demonstrated that a simple direct pre-lithiation can improve the electrochemical performance of the flexible CNT anode by diminishing their extensive and large irreversible capacity, as well as providing a lithium supply to compensate the lithium loss during cycling. As a result, the CNT electrode shows good cycling stability over 500 cycles and excellent rate capabilities, even at high C-rates.
