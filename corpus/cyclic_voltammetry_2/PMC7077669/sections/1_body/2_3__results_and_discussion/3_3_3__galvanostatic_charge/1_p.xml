<p>In order to gain a deeper insight into the effect of the pre-lithiation process at different contact times, the galvanostatic charge–discharge tests were performed in a half-cell battery configuration. The charge–discharge curves for five CNT samples recorded at a current density of 3.6 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup> (2 C) are illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-00406-f004">Figure 4</xref>a–e. As can be seen, the various pre-lithiation times result in different electrochemical performances when the CNT are used as flexible anode materials. The plotted data shows the first two cycles corresponding to the discharge and charge processes of the pristine CNT and pre-lithiated CNT electrodes (1, 3, 15, and 30 min). During the first discharge of the pristine CNT, the voltage drops rapidly from OCV to 0.8 V vs. Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup> with a large discharge plateau corresponding to the SEI film formation consisting of a mixture of organic and inorganic lithium compounds [

 <xref rid="B53-polymers-12-00406" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. This pristine CNT provides a charge capacity of 8401 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> (3091 μAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup>) and a discharge capacity of 972 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> (358 μAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup>) at 2 C rate, holding ICE value of 11.57%. The very low ICE and a vast majority of irreversible capacity loss is related to the SEI formation [
