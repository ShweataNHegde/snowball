<p>Recently, our groups demonstrated the crucial impact of the electropolymerization of p-sulfonated poly(allyl phenyl ether) (SPAPE) electrolyte on the electrochemical performances of CNT anodes [

 <sup>−1</sup> (276 µAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup>) at 1 C rate with the ICE of 10.4% can be obtained and interestingly, the areal capacity of SPAPE-coated CNT is enhanced by 67% compared to the pristine ones [

However, due to their low ICE, in the current study we report a simple direct pre-lithiation method to alleviate the initial irreversible capacity of the electropolymerized CNT anodes for flexible micro-batteries. Indeed, the long-term and extensive cycling performance of the pre-lithiated CNT is achieved over 500 cycles at a 10 C rate and its excellent rate capability is also present even at very high current density (1 to 30 C rates).
