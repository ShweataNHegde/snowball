<p>Li-ion batteries (LIBs) have been successfully employed in a wide range of applications, such as electric vehicles, microelectronic devices, etc., due to their remarkable properties such as high energy density, lack of memory effect, long cycle life, low self-discharge and high thermal resistance [

 <xref rid="B3-polymers-12-00406" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A large variety of carbon-based materials for LIBs have been widely investigated, such as graphene, fullerene and carbon nanotubes (CNT) [

 <xref rid="B17-polymers-12-00406" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. As an allotrope of carbon, CNT electrodes offer several outstanding properties, such as excellent flexibility, fast charge transport, large surface-to-volume ratio, good chemical stability, high electrical conductivity and high reversible capacity [
