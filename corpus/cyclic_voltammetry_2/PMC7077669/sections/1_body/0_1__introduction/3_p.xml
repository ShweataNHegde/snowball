<p>Several pre-lithiation methods have been investigated to compensate the severe capacity loss of the anode materials, for instance, Seong et al. reported that SiO anode was effectively pre-lithiated using stabilized lithium metal powder (SLMP) [

 <xref rid="B43-polymers-12-00406" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and Scott et al. also reported a complete diminishing of the initial capacity loss for carbon electrodes using n-butyllithium in hexane [

 <sub>2</sub>S/KB cathode by pre-lithiation and the lithiated cathode exhibited high capacity of 1000 mAh g
 <sup>âˆ’1</sup> with a coulombic efficiency around 95% at 0.2 C [
