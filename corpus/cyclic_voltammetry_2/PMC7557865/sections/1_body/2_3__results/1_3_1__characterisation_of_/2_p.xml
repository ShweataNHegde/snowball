<p>TGA with linearly rising temperature in air atmosphere was used to determine the actual ratio of Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C against CNT or CXG, based on the fact that the final product of the analysis is pure MoO
 <sub>3</sub>. TGA data showed a similar amount of Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C in both electrocatalysts. For CNT support, 28.5 wt.% of Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C was incorporated into Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/CNT. If CXG is used as support, synthesised electrocatalyst contained 25.6 wt.% of Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C.
