<p>Specific surface area and porosity of electrocatalysts were investigated using N
 <sub>2</sub>-sorption analysis (Quantachrome NOVA 4200e multi-station, Quantachrome Instruments, Boynton Beach, FL, USA). Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/CNT was found to be non-porous with a specific surface area of 182 m
 <sup>2</sup> g
 <sup>−1</sup>. For mesoporous Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/CXG, an average pore diameter of ca. 18 nm and a specific area of 410 m
 <sup>2</sup> g
 <sup>−1</sup> were determined.
