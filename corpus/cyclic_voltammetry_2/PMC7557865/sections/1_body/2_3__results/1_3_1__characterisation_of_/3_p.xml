<p>SEM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (FEI Tecnai F30, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) analyses revealed significantly different morphologies of the two electrocatalysts. Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/CNT showed characteristic tube-like morphology with tube diameters of 10â€“60 nm and disperse carbide nanoparticles clearly distinguishable in the TEM images (
