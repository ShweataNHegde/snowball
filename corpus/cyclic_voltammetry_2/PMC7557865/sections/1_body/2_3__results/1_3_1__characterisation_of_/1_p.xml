<p>The activity of two samples towards HER has been tested in the authors’ previous work, along with their characterisation by XRD, SEM, TGA, and XPS [
 <xref rid="B24-nanomaterials-10-01805" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-nanomaterials-10-01805" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. XRD analysis confirmed the formation of α-Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C onto CNTs and CXG and enabled the determination of crystal structure and average crystal size. XRD peaks were assigned to the orthorhombic structure of α-Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C (ICSD card #1326) and crystallite sizes of 22.3 and 28.6 nm were evaluated for Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/CNT and Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/CXG, respectively. It should be mentioned that a previous study of ORR at different phases of molybdenum carbide supported on carbon in acidic media have shown that their activity towards ORR is strongly influenced by the carbides’ structure so that α-Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/C shows higher activity compared to δ-MoC/C, most likely due to the stronger affinity of the former for O
 <sub>2</sub> adsorption [
 <xref rid="B42-nanomaterials-10-01805" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This was further confirmed by the theoretical calculations of O
 <sub>2</sub> adsorption energy on the α-Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C [
 <xref rid="B43-nanomaterials-10-01805" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and on the δ-MoC [
 <xref rid="B44-nanomaterials-10-01805" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Thus, O
 <sub>2</sub> is predicted to spontaneously dissociate upon adsorption on α-Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C.
