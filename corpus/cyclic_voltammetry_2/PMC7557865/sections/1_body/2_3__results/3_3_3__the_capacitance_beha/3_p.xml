<p>Double-layer capacity was determined as the slope of ∆
 <italic>j</italic>/2 vs. 
 <italic>ν</italic> plot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-01805-f003">Figure 3</xref>c,d), where ∆
 <italic>j</italic> is the difference of anodic 
 <italic>j</italic>
 <sub>a</sub> and cathodic 
 <italic>j</italic>
 <sub>c</sub> current densities at a given potential and 
 <italic>ν</italic> is the scan rate. Thus, double-layer capacity was calculated to be 75 mF cm
 <sup>−2</sup> and 24 mF cm
 <sup>−2</sup> for Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/CXG and Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/CNT, respectively. This result indicates the higher electrochemically active surface of Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/CXG than of Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/CNT sample, in agreement with BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) surface area values determined from N
 <sub>2</sub>-sorption measurements performed in our previous work and evidenced in comparative cyclic voltammograms (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-01805-f004">Figure 4</xref>). The higher current response of Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/CXG compared to Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/CNT is the consequence of the higher specific surface of CXG-supported Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C.
