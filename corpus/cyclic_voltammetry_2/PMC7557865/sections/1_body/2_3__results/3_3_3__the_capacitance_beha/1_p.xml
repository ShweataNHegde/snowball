<p>To characterise the Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/CXG and Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/CNT interface in an alkaline aqueous solution, cyclic voltammograms of both samples were recorded in KOH and NaOH electrolyte solution (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-01805-f002">Figure 2</xref>). At a low scan rate of 10 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup>, one can see that the capacitive current does not depend on the type of electrolyte used. Namely, the current response is determined by the sample texture, whereas the K
 <sup>+</sup> and Na
 <sup>+</sup> ions have enough time to penetrate the pores/spaces equally. At higher rates, the difference between K
 <sup>+</sup> and Na
 <sup>+</sup> adsorption/desorption processes becomes more pronounced. The ion mobility through the electrolytes turns out to be the determining step at higher scan rates, thus causing the difference in the rate of the electric double layer (EDL) formation. Namely, the higher current response in KOH than in NaOH, measured at 50 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup>, originates from the faster motion of K
 <sup>+</sup> ions through the electrolyte, in other words, the higher transference number of K
 <sup>+</sup> vs. Na
 <sup>+</sup>.
