<p>To summarize, the background current of the electrical double layer in an alkaline solution is insensitive to the nature of cation at lower scan rates. In contrast, at higher scan rates, it is less pronounced in NaOH than in KOH. For this reason, NaOH was chosen as the conductive electrolytic medium to examine the electrocatalytic activity of samples towards the ORR.</p>
