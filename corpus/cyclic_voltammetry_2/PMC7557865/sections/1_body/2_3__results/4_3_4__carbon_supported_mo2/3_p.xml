<p>The RDE profiles of two studied carbon-supported Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C showed increasing current density with increasing rotation rates up to 2400 rpm, indicating a kinetic limitation of the reaction. Constructed K–L plots (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-01805-f005">Figure 5</xref>c) represented straight lines of good linearity, suggesting that ORR is a first-order reaction with respect to O
 <sub>2</sub> concentration in the electrolytic solution [

 <sub>2</sub>C/CNT and Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/CXG, 
 <italic>n</italic> values were determined from the slope of K–L plots to be 2.7 and 3.0 electrons, respectively. Similar behaviour has been reported for the case of unsupported and carbon-supported Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C nanowires where average 
 <italic>n</italic> during ORR was determined to be 3 in 0.7–0.4 V potential range and 4 in 0.3–0 V potential range. Values from 2.1 to 3.8 have been reported for different Mo
