<p>Next, Tafel analysis was carried out providing insight into the mechanism of oxygen adsorption on the surface of two studied samples. ORR Tafel slopes,

 <xref rid="B48-nanomaterials-10-01805" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The suitable current typically lies in the 10â€“80% range of the limiting current (upon mass-transfer correction). Still, the authors opted for defining a potential range for Tafel analysis as well-defined limiting current densities were not reached.
