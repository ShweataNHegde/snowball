<p>The catalytic activity of carbon-supported Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C electrocatalysts for ORR was investigated in O
 <sub>2</sub>-saturated (Messer, 99.9995 vol%, Belgrade, Serbia) 0.1 M NaOH using LSV with a rotating disk electrode (RDE). ORR onset potential was found to be somewhat more positive at Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/CXG (0.89 V) compared to Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/CNT (0.81 V) (

 <sub>2</sub>C nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanofibers (Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/NPCNFs) (0.9 V in 0.1 M KOH) [

 <sub>2</sub>C nanowires (0.87 V in 0.1 M KOH) [

 <sub>2</sub>C/CXG vs. 0.62 V for Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/CNT), most likely due to its porosity, higher double-layer capacitance, and larger (active) surface area that accelerate the electron transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface and enhance its performance towards ORR. For further comparison purposes, ORR current densities at Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C-based electrocatalysts at 0.6 V at 1600 rpm fall in the range from −2.3 to −4.6 mA cm
