 <italic>b</italic> values for the ORR at Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/CNT were evaluated to be 77 mV dec
 <sup>−1</sup> (in the low overpotential region where the ORR rate is governed by the rate of surface reaction on the electrocatalyst) and 119 mV dec
 <sup>−1</sup>. For Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/CXG, only one Tafel slope was observed with a value of 128 mV dec
 <sup>−1</sup>. Tafel slope for ORR at Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C nanowires was reported to be 65 mV dec
 <sup>−1</sup> in low overpotential region (0.87–0.83 V), close to the value for a Pt/C catalyst (64 mV dec
 <sup>−1</sup>) [

 <sub>2</sub>C NPs embedded in Fe-N-doped carbon nanolayers (Mo
