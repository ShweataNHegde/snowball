<p>The catalytic performance of two carbon-supported Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C in alkaline solution was comparable so that ORR proceeds by a combination of two- and four-electron mechanisms at both electrocatalysts. Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/CXG showed somewhat higher activity in terms of the ORR onset potential, half-wave potential, and recorded current densities due to the mentioned higher surface area and a higher number of active sites. Therefore, the use of inexpensive carbides on highly-conductive, high-surface-area carbon nanotubes and carbon xerogel support materials points out a new direction of electrocatalyst performance optimisation for next-generation fuel cells. Further work should include testing of long-term stability of synthesised samples and evaluating the potential application in fuel cells, metal-air batteries, and supercapacitors.
