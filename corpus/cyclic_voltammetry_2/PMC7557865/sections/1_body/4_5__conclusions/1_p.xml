<p>Within this study, it was shown that the type of cation (K
 <sup>+</sup> or Na
 <sup>+</sup>) in the alkaline electrolytic solution does not affect the rate of the formation of an electrical double layer at low scan rates, since both K
 <sup>+</sup> and Na
 <sup>+</sup> ions are capable of penetrating the available active sites. However, the different mobility of these cations through the electrolyte is found to be critical for the rate of double-layer formation at higher scan rates. Thus, the capacity of ions that are involved in the EDL formation was higher in KOH than in NaOH, due to the higher mobility of K
 <sup>+</sup> ions through the electrolyte. Furthermore, Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/CXG shows higher specific capacitance than Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/CNT (75 mF cm
 <sup>−2</sup> vs. 23 mF cm
 <sup>−2</sup>), due to the higher specific surface area and porosity.
