<p>Compared to the herein studied catalysts, better results in terms of Tafel slope and current densities at a given potential values display the compositions Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/NPCNFs [
 <xref rid="B28-nanomaterials-10-01805" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C@NC-Fe [
 <xref rid="B49-nanomaterials-10-01805" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In the case of the Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C@NC-Fe catalyst, better performance may be attributed to the promotive effect of ferrous carbide. Considering Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/NPCNFs, its synthesis procedure assumed a simultaneous outbreak of molybdenum carbide and carbon support which most likely led to a better contact between them. These facts may serve as directions for future improvement of the herein studied catalysts.
