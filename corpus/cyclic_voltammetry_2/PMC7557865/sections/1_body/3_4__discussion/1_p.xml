<p>ORR can occur through two- or four-electron mechanism. The four-electron mechanism implies a direct reduction of molecular oxygen to water by the exchange of four electrons. This is the preferred pathway for oxygen reduction because the alternative two-electron mechanism implies a reduction of molecular oxygen to water via an intermediate step in which peroxide ions are formed. Peroxide can then be reduced to water or can segregate from the electrode and not be involved in the subsequent reaction. ORR on almost all catalysts proceeds by a combination of these two mechanisms where the four-electron mechanism is only dominant in the activation-controlled potential range. One of the most investigated catalysts on which ORR is dominantly occurring through a four-electron mechanism is Pt and Pt-based catalysts; however, even on them, ORR is not occurring by this mechanism in the whole ORR potential range. The number of exchanged electron values obtained herein indicated that ORR at Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/CNT and Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/CXG is under mixed control where both of the above-mentioned mechanisms are involved, as supported by the appearance of two reduction waves. Previous studies on other Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C-based electrocatalysts indicated that the ORR at these electrocatalysts also proceeds by a combination of two-electron and four-electron mechanisms or by a two-step two-electron mechanism involving the generation of HO
