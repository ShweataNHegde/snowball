<p>Supporting Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C nanoparticles on carbon materials, commercial CNTs and prepared CXG, resulted in their good catalytic performance towards ORR for electrochemical energy conversion and storage applications. Their activity is attributed to the synergic effect between carbide species and carbon support. The nature of the catalytic sites (Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C species, molybdenum oxides, or molybdenum oxycarbide species) for the ORR is still under discussion. Namely, it has been shown that the surface of Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C particles is contaminated with molybdenum oxides (MoO
 <sub>3</sub> and MoO
 <sub>2</sub>), but their concentration notably decreases upon short activation by galvanostatic electrolysis. The activity of Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/CXG was observed to be somewhat higher due to its porosity and large active surface area that accelerate the interfacial electrochemical reaction. In comparison with the available data for other Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C-based electrocatalysts reported in the literature so far (
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-10-01805-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/CXG shows higher onset potential along with comparable current densities and number of exchange electrons.
