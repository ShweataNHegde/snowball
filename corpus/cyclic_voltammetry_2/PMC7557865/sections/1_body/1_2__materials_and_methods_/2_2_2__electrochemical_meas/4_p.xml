<p>The electrodes were tested for the ORR in 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solutions at room temperature. cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear scan voltammetry (LSV) measurements were done from 0.2 to 1 V vs. RHE at a scan rate of 10 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup>. For rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements, the rotation speed (
