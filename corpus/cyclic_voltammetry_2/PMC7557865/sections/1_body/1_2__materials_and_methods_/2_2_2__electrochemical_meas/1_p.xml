<p>All electrochemical measurements were carried out on Gamry PCI4/300 Potentiostat/Galvanostat (Gamry Instruments, Werminster, PA, USA) using a conventional three-electrode system in a single-compartment glass cell of 50 mL volume. The working electrode (Pine Instruments, Durham, NC, USA) was prepared as described below, while a Pt electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE, Hannah Instruments, Woonsocket, RI, USA) served as counter and reference electrode, respectively. All electrode potentials are converted and given relative to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).</p>
