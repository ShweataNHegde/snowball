<p>Catalytic ink was made by adding 5.0 mg of the electrocatalyst (Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/CNT or Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/CXG) with 50 μL of Nafion (5 wt.%, Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) into 750 μL of ethanol (p.a., Merck, St. Louis, MO, USA) and mixing it ultrasonically for 30 min. The working electrode (Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/CNT or Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/CXG) was prepared by pipetting 20 μL of the corresponding catalytic ink onto a polished glassy carbon electrode (GCE, 5 mm diameter) and leaving it to dry at room temperature. Current densities were calculated using the geometric surface area of the electrode.
