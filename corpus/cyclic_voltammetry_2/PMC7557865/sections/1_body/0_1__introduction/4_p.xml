<p>In our recent work, we have successfully prepared Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C supported on commercial CNTs (Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/CNT) and synthesised CXG (Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/CXG). In this work, Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/CNT and Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C/CXG were tested as electrocatalysts for the ORR in alkaline fuel cells and for supercapacitors.
