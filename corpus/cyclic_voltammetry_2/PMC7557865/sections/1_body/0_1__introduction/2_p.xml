<p>Transition metal carbides (TMCs) are a potential alternative to replace Pt-based electrocatalysts due to the TMCs’ similar electronic density as Pt [
 <xref rid="B10-nanomaterials-10-01805" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Furthermore, TMCs display high electrical conductivity, high oxidation resistance, high hardness, and high melting point. TMCs, such as molybdenum carbide (Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C), vanadium carbide (V
 <sub>8</sub>C
 <sub>7</sub>), and tungsten carbide (WC), have shown similar catalytic and electrocatalytic activities as Pt-group noble metals [

 <xref rid="B13-nanomaterials-10-01805" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. For instance, TMCs have been suggested as supports for Pt and Pt-group metals in fuel cells [

 <xref rid="B16-nanomaterials-10-01805" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Pt-group metals supported on vanadium carbide (VC) and tantalum carbide (TaC) have been shown to have synergistic effects for the ORR, while zirconium carbide (ZrC) has shown to be a good support material for hydrogen oxidation reaction electrocatalysts [

 <xref rid="B19-nanomaterials-10-01805" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Recently, WC, carbon-supported and unsupported, has been explored as an inexpensive, Pt-free electrocatalyst for ORR [

 <xref rid="B22-nanomaterials-10-01805" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Carbon-supported Mo
 <sub>2</sub>C has also been reported to show high electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) [

 <xref rid="B24-nanomaterials-10-01805" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], as well as for ORR [
 <xref rid="B25-nanomaterials-10-01805" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-nanomaterials-10-01805" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-nanomaterials-10-01805" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-nanomaterials-10-01805" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. TMCs’ advantage for applications in fuel cells is their higher abundance (they are several orders of magnitude more abundant than Pt) [
 <xref rid="B29-nanomaterials-10-01805" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and, consequently, lower price as electrocatalysts account for ca. 50% of a commercial fuel cell price.
