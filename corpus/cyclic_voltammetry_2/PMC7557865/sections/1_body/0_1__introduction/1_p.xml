<p>Demand for sustainable and efficient energy sources to complement and eventually substitute existing fossil fuel-based ones has arisen with the increasing energy demand and environmental pollution. Electrochemical energy conversion devices such as fuel cells (FCs), batteries, and supercapacitors, are believed to be the most feasible alternatives among different energy technologies considered. Thus, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has received much attention due to its application in fuel cells and metal-air batteries [

 <xref rid="B4-nanomaterials-10-01805" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Sluggish ORR kinetics is one of the main limiting factors in the energy conversion efficiency of fuel cells and metal-air batteries, since ORR requires high overpotential and has a complex mechanism involving numerous steps [

 <xref rid="B8-nanomaterials-10-01805" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. ORR in alkaline media such as in alkaline fuel cells (AFCs) has faster kinetics, enabling the use of non-platinum (Pt) electrocatalysts in these cells [
