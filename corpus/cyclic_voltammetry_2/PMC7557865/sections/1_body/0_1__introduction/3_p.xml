<p>TMC particles tend to agglomerate during their synthesis, especially under high-temperature reaction conditions [
 <xref rid="B10-nanomaterials-10-01805" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, large carbide particles display lower electrocatalytic activity compared to their nanosized counterparts due to too high densities and low specific surface areas. Thus, it is of great importance to develop nanosized TMCs with controllable particle size [
 <xref rid="B14-nanomaterials-10-01805" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Further increase of electrocatalysts efficiency in FCs and metal-air batteries can be achieved by using high-surface-area and high-porosity support materials [
 <xref rid="B30-nanomaterials-10-01805" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The support material should additionally be characterised by high electrical conductivity along with high corrosion-stability in different electrolytes used in fuel cells. Various types of carbon materials including carbon black, activated carbon, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), carbon xerogel (CXG), and graphene have been considered and tested as electrocatalyst supports for electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices [

 <xref rid="B33-nanomaterials-10-01805" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. CNTs and CXG have an advantage in terms of their 3D interconnected uniform pore structure that allows a high-degree dispersion of the active material and efficient diffusion of electrolyte [
 <xref rid="B34-nanomaterials-10-01805" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Hence, electrocatalysts supported on CXG and CNTs have been reported to exhibit improved performance in comparison with those supported on conventional supports, such as Vulcan carbon black [
