<p>Looking to the electrochemical response towards ORR of the investigated materials and analysing these results by comparison with the results obtained from different characterization techniques, some questions need to be addressed: have we tested the best materials for ORR or is it possible to find an N-doped material, prepared by ball milling procedure, with improved electrochemical properties for our study?</p>
