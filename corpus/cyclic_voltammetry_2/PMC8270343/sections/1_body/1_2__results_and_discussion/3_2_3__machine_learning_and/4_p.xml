<p>Firstly, we applied the reverse engineering process for the synthesis parameters; our data make it possible to obtain perspective for the reaction time, but not for the melamine amounts. We continued with the most significant variables, the material characteristics that could provide information regarding the materials’ properties: the nitrogen doping percentage, the pyridinic and pyrrolic N content, the quality of graphene (Csp

 <sup>3</sup> ratio, C-O or C=O amounts from the graphene surface), the FWHM of the XRD peak, and the I

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-03858">Table S4</xref>—prediction column; it seems that the synthesis reaction time needs to be extended to 25 h to provide the optimal number of electrons (four) transferred during the ORR process. The predicted parameters could be used as indications to guide the investigation of the structure–ORR response relationship, and could be involved in understanding how the materials can be modified for a better response.
