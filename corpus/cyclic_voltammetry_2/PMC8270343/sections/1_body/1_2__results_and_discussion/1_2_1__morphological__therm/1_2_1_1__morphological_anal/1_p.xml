 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03858-f001">Figure 1</xref> shows the morphological characterization of the investigated materials. Thus, the TEM, SEM and compositional elemental mapping of the four N-doped graphene (N-Gr-3-24, N-Gr-10-24, N-Gr-3-48, N-Gr-10-48) are presented; the first number represents the amounts (g) of melamine used in the synthesis procedure, while the second one is the time (h) employed for grinding in the ball milling process (see Materials and Methods section).
