<p>These images indicate the nitrogen doping of the graphene and the presence of oxygen species on the graphene surface. Moreover, the graphene obtained by ball milling procedure appears to have a fluffy structure, very different from that synthetised by CVD or chemical methods [

It is clear from these pictures that multilayer and crumpled graphene are synthetized by this method, suggesting the idea of multiple defective sites and edges on the graphene and explaining the high density of heteroatoms (nitrogen and oxygen) observed in the EDX elemental mapping of these hybrid nanomaterials (
