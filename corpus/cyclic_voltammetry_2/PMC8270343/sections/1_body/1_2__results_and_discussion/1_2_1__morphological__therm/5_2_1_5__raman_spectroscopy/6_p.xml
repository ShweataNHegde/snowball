<p>Although the 785 nm laser excitation is not generally used for the graphene characterization, due to the presence of melamine in the two physical mixtures (graphiteâ€“melamine 1:3 and 1:10), their investigation requires that this wavelength be used. The obtained results are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-03858">Figure S4</xref>, highlighting the differences between the N-doped graphene and physical mixtures, and, at the same time, between the N-doped graphene and graphite.
