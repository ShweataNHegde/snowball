<p>The intensity of the 2D peak is much higher for N-Gr-10-24, which has the lowest amount of nitrogen, leading to a larger value of the I
 <sub>2D</sub>/I
 <sub>G</sub> ratio; the I
 <sub>2D</sub>/I
 <sub>G</sub> values decrease with the increase in nitrogen contents in the materials and agree with the literature data [
