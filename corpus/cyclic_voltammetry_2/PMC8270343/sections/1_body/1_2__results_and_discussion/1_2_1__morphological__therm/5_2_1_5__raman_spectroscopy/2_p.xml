<p>The analysis of the Raman results of the graphite and the new prepared hybrid materials reveals a particular pattern under the 514.5 nm laser irradiation. The main features in the Raman spectrum of graphite are the D, G and 2D bands localized at 1355, 1585 and 2725 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. Thus, the 1355 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> peak, which is characteristic of polycrystalline graphite, can be attributed to a particle size effect and its intensity is inversely proportional to the crystallite size [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03858-f005">Figure 5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-03858">Table S3</xref>). This band significantly increases in the N-doped graphene, indicating a reduction in their crystallite size, as is also revealed by XRD measurements (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-03858">Table S2</xref>). The D peak is also activated by defects and its intensity increases in disordered graphene alongside with other two disorder peaks, D′ (about 1625 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) and D + G (about 2950 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03858-f005">Figure 5</xref>, the G and 2D′ bands’ regions are marked in green due to their shifting with the increase in N-doping percentage; thus, the G peaks shift to a higher frequency (from 1590 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> to 1596 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) as the N concentrations increase, and the 2D′ peaks show a down-shifting (from 3241 to 3215 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) associated with the N content rising. The 2D peaks are located between 2707 and 2704 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>; however, the slight redshift of the 2D bands could not be directly associated with the increasing of the N amounts in the composite (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03858-f005">Figure 5</xref>).
