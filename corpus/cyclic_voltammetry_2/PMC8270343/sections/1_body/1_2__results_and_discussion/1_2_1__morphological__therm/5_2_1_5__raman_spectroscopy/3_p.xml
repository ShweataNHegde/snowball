<p>Looking to the data from 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-03858">Table S3</xref>, it seems that there is not a relationship between the I
 <sub>D</sub>/I
 <sub>G</sub> ratio and the nitrogen content of the four hybrid materials. However, the ratio between I
 <sub>D’</sub> and I
 <sub>G</sub> (I
 <sub>D′</sub>/I
 <sub>G</sub>)—calculated for the four N-doped graphene materials—increases from 0.41 to 0.56, showing a better correlation with the N materials’ content than that of the I
 <sub>D</sub>/I
 <sub>G</sub>. Nevertheless, when attention is paid to the differences between all I
 <sub>D’</sub>/I
 <sub>G</sub> values, we observe that these differences are not entirely connected with the concentrations’ differences (a 0.1 I
 <sub>D′</sub>/I
 <sub>G</sub> variation for 1.27 N-concentrations’ difference for the first two materials, and a 0.03 I
 <sub>D′</sub>/I
 <sub>G</sub> variation for 1.7 N-concentrations’ difference for the last two composites, see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-03858">Table S3</xref>). A detailed evaluation of the XRD and Raman results highlights the reliance of the I
 <sub>D’</sub>/I
 <sub>G</sub> ratio on the graphene crystallite size and the numbers of graphene layers, showing a good correlation of these data (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-03858">Tables S2 and S3</xref>).
