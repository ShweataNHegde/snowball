<p>The evaluation of the I
 <sub>D</sub>/I
 <sub>D′</sub> ratio indicates values between 3.54 and 3.9, which means more defects in the boundaries. However, this variation cannot be linked only to the nitrogen amounts from the hybrid materials. The I
 <sub>D</sub>/I
 <sub>D′</sub> values can be explained by considering all the defects from the materials, including the CO groups from the graphene surface (
