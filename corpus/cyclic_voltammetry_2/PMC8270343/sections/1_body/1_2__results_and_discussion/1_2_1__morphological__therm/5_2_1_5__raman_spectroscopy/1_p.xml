 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-03858">Table S3</xref> show the Raman spectra as well as different parameters obtained from these spectra; for an easy comparison, the N-doping concentrations of materials are also indicated. The band positions are obtained after the Lorentzian peaksâ€™ deconvolution, while the N concentration values are taken from the elemental analysis.
