<p>Three major nitrogen types—pyridinic-N 398.4 eV, pyrrolic-N 399.5 eV, and pyridine-N-oxide ~404.9 eV—have been identified from the XPS measurements [

 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-03858" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The presence of pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N, and the lack of graphitic-N, suggest the doping of the graphene layer at the edges or the structural vacancies. The comparison of the elemental composition (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-03858">Figure S3</xref>) shows that no analogy can be established between the two analyses for the investigated materials. The inhomogeneity of the samples due to the N-doping at the edges and vacancies and the different natures of the two methods (total combustion of sample and surface analysis, respectively) are the main reasons for the observed variation. Regarding the distribution of the N-functional type, the pyrrolic-N fraction seems to have the highest value; the N-Gr-3-24 sample has the highest percentage of N-pyrrolic type, followed by the N-Gr-10-24 and N-Gr-10-48 ones (
