<p>The quality of the four materials has been investigated by considering the XPS percentages obtained for the C1s, in terms of the Csp
 <sup>2</sup>/Csp
 <sup>3</sup> ratio and the content of oxygen functionalities from the graphene surface (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-03858">Table S1</xref>). The results show a better quality for the carbon materials prepared by the 24 h ball milling procedure (the highest Csp
 <sup>2</sup>/Csp
 <sup>3</sup> ratio and the lower quantity of oxygen functionalities on the graphene surfaces).
