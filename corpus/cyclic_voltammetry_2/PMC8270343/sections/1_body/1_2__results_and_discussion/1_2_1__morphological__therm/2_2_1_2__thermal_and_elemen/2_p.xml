<p>For the hybrid materials, the TG and DTG curves, obtained under the argon atmosphere, show nearly no weight loss for graphite (as we already observed from the physical mixtures’ investigation, see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-03858">Figure S2</xref>), while, for the N-doped materials, three separate regions can be observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03858-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The first one corresponds to the adsorbed water content; it is situated until 100 °C and has a weight loss of about 3–5.7% (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03858-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The second weight-loss step, ranging in the temperature region of 125–360 °C, is most probably due to the intermolecular dehydration of the vicinal carboxylic or hydroxylic groups, yielding to most stable oxygen-compounds (lactones, anhydrides, ethers and carbonyls) and releasing the so-called “chemical water” [

 <sub>2</sub>, can be also seen in this region [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-03858" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]; the materials have a weight loss of about 2.5–4.4% in region II (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03858-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The third region, from 400 to 600 °C, can be associated with the decomposition of anhydrides and individual phenols and shows a weight loss of 7.3–13.9% (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03858-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, in addition to the previous steps, the functionalized material exhibits a continuous weight loss, reaching a total weight loss of about 19.4–28.4% (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03858-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>); this weight loss can be obtained from the decomposition of lactones or individual ethers [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-03858" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].
