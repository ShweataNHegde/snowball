<p>The authors assume that a small oxygen percentage from the four N-doped graphene could be from the graphite, but most of the oxygen content is from the water adsorbed on graphene during the material treatment (washing with hot water)—region I of the TGA—and from the O-functional groups that are formed during the grinding process, considering that the materials are obtained in air and not under argon or nitrogen atmosphere. According to the data from 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-03858-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, N-Gr-3-48 is the material most exposed to the environmental conditions (oxygen and air humidity); it is obtained from a 1:3 ratio of graphite/melamine and after 48 h of grinding at 400 rpm.
