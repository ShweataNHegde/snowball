<p>According to these results, the number of graphene sheets depends on the quantity of melamine and the reaction time; when a large quantity of melamine is involved, a reaction time of 24 h is not enough to lead to low graphene layers (larger quantities of billing agent/reactant need more energy to accomplish the graphite exfoliation). When the reaction time is 48 h, the differences between the general parameters of the two composites are small (
