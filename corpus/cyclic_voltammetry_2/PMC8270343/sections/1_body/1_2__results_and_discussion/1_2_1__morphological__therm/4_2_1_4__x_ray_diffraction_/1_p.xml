<p>The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the four N-doped graphene are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03858-f004">Figure 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-03858">Table S2</xref>. We observe a broadening of the peak at 2θ = 26°, corresponding to the [002] diffraction plane, for all the N-Gr-materials, indicating that the N doping of the graphite has been successfully induced by the ball milling process. According to Jeon et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-03858" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], the doping process occurs on the edges of the graphene. The N-doping process occurred on all the materials regardless of the milling time and the ratio between the components. The peak at about 2θ = 43° recorded for nitrogen-doped graphene corresponds to [100] reflection of the honeycomb structure; it is related to the sp
 <sup>2</sup> hybridized carbons [

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-03858">Table S2</xref>) highlight the differences between the samples. The lowest 2θ and the highest FWHM parameters can be associated with the N-Gr-3-48 material; this sample possesses the lowest crystallite size and number of graphene sheets. Moreover, from all the N-doped graphene, the N-Gr-10-24 sample has the lowest FWHM, the highest crystallite size (except graphite), and the highest number of graphene layers.
