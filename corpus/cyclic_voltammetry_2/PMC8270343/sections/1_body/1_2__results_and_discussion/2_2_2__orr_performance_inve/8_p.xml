<p>The catalysts’ tolerance towards CO poisoning was also investigated using CO stripping voltammetry. CVs were recorded in N
 <sub>2</sub> and CO saturated 1M NaOH electrolyte, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-03858">Figure S6</xref>). In the case of nitrogen doped graphene, no significant modification of the CVs’ profile was observed, while, for the Pt/C, two oxidation peaks appeared at −0.4 and −0.31 V vs. Ag/AgCl, showing a poisoning effect.
