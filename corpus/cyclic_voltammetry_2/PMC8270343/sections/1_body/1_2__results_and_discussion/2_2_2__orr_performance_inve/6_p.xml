<p>It is clear that the changes occurring in the materials during the additional 24 h of the synthesis process are determinant for their ORR behaviours (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03858-f007">Figure 7</xref>). For the ORR process in alkaline media, two mechanism types can be considered involving four (4 or 2 + 2) electron or two (2) electron pathways [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-26-03858" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. If, for the materials prepared within 24 h, the four-electron pathway is foreseen, in the case of the last two materials (48 h synthesis time), there is an alteration in their response for ORR; most probably, for these composites, the two-electron pathway becomes more significant in the ORR process (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03858-f007">Figure 7</xref>f). Moreover, the kinetic current densities, calculated from the Kouteckyâ€“Levich plots, were found to be 6.98 mA/cm
 <sup>2</sup> for 10 wt.% Pt/C and 7.84 mA/cm
 <sup>2</sup> for N-Gr-3-24, suggesting a better response towards ORR of the N-doped graphene material.
