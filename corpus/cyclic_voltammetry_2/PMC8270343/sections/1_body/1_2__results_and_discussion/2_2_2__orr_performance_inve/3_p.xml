<p>As can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03858-f006">Figure 6</xref>a, the CV curves show an oxygen reduction peak at âˆ’0.216 V for N-Gr-3-24, N-Gr-3-48, N-Gr-10-48, and -0.230 V for N-Gr-10-24, demonstrating their potential as metal-free electrocatalysts for ORR in alkaline solution. The ORR current densities obtained from the second cycle are comparable for three of the four N-doped graphene materials investigated, indicating the following order of response: N-Gr-3-24 &gt; N-Gr-10-24 &gt; N-Gr-10-48 &gt; N-Gr-3-48; all ORR current densities values are higher than the 10 wt.% Pt/C electrode response (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-03858-f006">Figure 6</xref>b). A higher response is obtained from the composite N-Gr-3-24, meaning that the better result is achieved when lower amounts of melamine and the lowest grinding time are employed in the synthesis procedure. 
 <italic>According to these results, neither the use of large amounts of melamine nor the increase in the reaction time is justified for ball milling preparation of efficient catalysts for oxygen reduction in alkaline media.</italic>
