<p>Based on the K–L equation, there is a variation of the numbers of electrons transferred with the potentials, indicating a complex mechanism. The best results are observed for N-Gr-3-24 and N-Gr-10-24, of about 3.96 and 4.1 at −0.45 V, which are close to the theoretical value of Pt/C (4 electrons). These hybrid materials appear to be more efficient for ORR compared to N-Gr-3-48 and N-Gr-10-48 (numbers of electrons transferred: 3.41 and 3.08 at −0.45 V).</p>
