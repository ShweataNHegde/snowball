<p>The long-term stability of the four nitrogen doped materials and Pt/C was investigated using cycling voltammetry (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-03858">Figure S5</xref>). The catalytic activity retained after 400 cycles was found to be 73.4% for N-Gr-3-24, 70.7% for N-Gr-10-24, 64% for N-Gr-3-48, 36.6% for N-Gr-10-48 and 52.7% for Pt/C.
