<p>Firstly, in order to explore the electrocatalytic properties of the N-doped graphene towards ORR, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements have been performed in N
 <sub>2</sub>- or O
 <sub>2</sub>-saturated 1M NaOH solutions at a scan rate of 50 mV/s using the N-doped graphene/glassy carbon (GC) modified electrodes; for comparison, the 10 wt.% Pt/C modified GC has been prepared and tested towards ORR in alkaline medium (
