<p>Thus, morphological, thermal, elemental analyses and XPS investigations have been used to obtain data about the materials’ properties. Moreover, as a rapid screening for the performance of N-doped graphene in the ORR process, we showed that the correlation between the XRD and Raman spectroscopy methods can be effective. These methods give valuable information about the graphene crystallite size and number of graphene sheets, while some parameters attained from Raman data can be correlated with the nitrogen contents and crystallite size/number of graphene layers. Thus, the G peaks shift to higher frequencies when the N concentrations increase in the materials, the I
 <sub>D′</sub>/I
 <sub>G</sub> and I
 <sub>2D</sub>/I
 <sub>G</sub> ratios exhibit a good correlation with the nitrogen content and the crystallite size/number of graphene sheets, while the I
 <sub>D</sub>/I
 <sub>D′</sub> values are similar with the current density responses obtained for the investigated materials.
