<p>We have prepared, by a green and easily scalable method, four types of N-doped graphene materials with a nitrogen content ranging from 8.34 to 13.1 wt.%. These materials have been tested towards ORR by cyclic voltammetry and rotating disk electrode protocols and their electrochemical responses have been compared with the results obtained from the surfaces and chemical investigation techniques.</p>
