<p>By combining the synthesis parameters, the data obtained from different characterization techniques and the materials response towards ORR, we tested the possibility of using the machine learning algorithms for the optimization of synthesis conditions and prediction of the best structure parameters. The regression learner and reverse engineering methods have been employed to obtain these predictions. Our results highlight the advantage of using machine learning for the optimization of synthesis conditions and the design of materials.</p>
