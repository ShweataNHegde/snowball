<p>Machine learning studies were performed using the Regression learner app implemented in MATLAB R2017b (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). The best predicted model was exported in the Matlab workspace and the predicted results were then used in the reverse engineering process; thus, the inverse prediction function (
