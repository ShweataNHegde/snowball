<p>The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analyses were recorded by using a Bruker D8 advanced diffractometer (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) with Cu Kα1 radiation, operating voltage 40 kV, and current 40 mA. The diffraction patterns were measured in the range 15° &lt; 2
 <italic>θ</italic>&lt; 85° with a step size of 0.01°/s.
