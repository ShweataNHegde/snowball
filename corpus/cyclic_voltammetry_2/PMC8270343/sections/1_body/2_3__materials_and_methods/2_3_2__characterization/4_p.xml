<p>For X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), a SPECS XPS (SPECS, Berlin, Germany) equipped with an Al/Mg dual-anode X-ray source, PHOIBOS hemispherical energy analyzer, 150 2D CCD, and a multichanneltron detector, were employed. The spectra were recorded for nitrogen, carbon, and oxygen elements by performing multiple scans with high resolution. Data analysis and curve-fitting were performed by employing a Gaussianâ€“Lorentzian product function and a nonlinear Shirley background subtraction. The high-resolution spectra were deconvoluted into the components corresponding to different types of bonds.</p>
