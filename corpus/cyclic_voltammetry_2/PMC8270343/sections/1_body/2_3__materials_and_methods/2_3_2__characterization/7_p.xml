<p>Electrochemical investigations, cyclic voltammetry (CV), rotating disk electrode voltammetry (RDE) and CO stripping voltammetry were performed on Autolab Potentiostat/Galvanostat 302N (Metrohm Autolab, Utrecht, The Netherlands), controlled by the Nova 1.11 software. The three-electrode system employed a graphene-based electrode (area 0.07 cm
 <sup>2</sup>) as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl (KCl, 3M), and platinum plate electrodes as the reference and auxiliary electrodes; all the measurements were realized in N
 <sub>2</sub>- or O
 <sub>2</sub>-saturated 1M NaOH solutions. For the RDE measurements, the spectra were recorded in O
 <sub>2</sub>-saturated 1M NaOH solution at various electrode rotating rates (400 to 2500 rpm) and a potential scan rate of 10 mV/s. The procedure for CO stripping experiments employed the following steps: (i) N
 <sub>2</sub> was bubbled on the electrolyte (1 M NaOH) at a constant potential of −0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 30 min, (ii) the gas was switched to CO and purged at the same potential for 30 min, (iii) the gas was switched back to N
 <sub>2</sub> for 30 min, keeping the potential at −0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl to remove the excess of CO gas from the electrolyte. The CO stripping voltammograms were recorded by cycling the potential between −1.0 and 0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl with 20 mV/s scan rate.
