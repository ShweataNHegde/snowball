<p>The Raman spectra were obtained using a JASCO NRS-3300 Raman Spectrometer (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) with a CCD detector and excitation at 514.5 nm from an argon-ion laser. An Olympus objective UMPLFL 100X, 600 L/mm grating, 0.1 × 6mm slit, and the wavenumber centered at 2300 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> were employed to record the spectra in the range of 73–4200 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. Each spectrum was collected with an exposure of 100 s and a minimum of three scans; the data were analyzed using OriginPro 2017 software.
