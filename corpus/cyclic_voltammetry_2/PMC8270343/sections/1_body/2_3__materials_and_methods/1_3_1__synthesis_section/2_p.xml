<p>During the grinding process, a high amount of energy was released and activated the reactants, thus making the doping process possible. Therefore, the nitrogen atoms from the melamine could be introduced in the graphite network, yielding to the nitrogen functionalized material. Thus, the synthesis was conducted at a temperature much lower than the temperature commonly used for chemical synthesis.</p>
