<p>Briefly, 1 g of graphite and the appropriate amounts of melamine were loaded in the milling bowl, sealed by fixing in the planetary ball-milling machine and grounded at 400 rpm for 24 h or 48 h, respectively. The obtained materials are denoted as N-Gr-3-24, N-Gr-3-48, N-Gr-10-24, N-Gr-10-48, in agreement with the ratios and reaction times employed in the synthesis procedure. Afterward, the materials were washed thoroughly with hot water to remove the un-reacted melamine.</p>
