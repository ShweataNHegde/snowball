<p>Our process was performed at room temperature. The weighted graphite and melamine were transferred to a stainless-steel grinding jar with grinding balls (10 mm diameter, 30 balls) made of stainless steel. Two ratios between graphite and melamine were chosen: 1:3 and 1:10; in addition, two reaction times of 24 and 48 h were investigated.</p>
