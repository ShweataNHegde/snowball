<p>The glassy carbon electrode (GC) having a diameter of 3 mm was used for modified electrode preparation. Before any treatment, the glassy carbon electrode was mechanically polished with chromium (III) oxide powder. An electrochemical treatment was also applied in 0.5 M H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> by cycling the potential between −1.0 and +1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl with a 50 mV/s scan rate. The modified electrodes were obtained as follows: 0.5 mg of the appropriate materials (N-doped graphene, 10 wt.% Pt/C) were suspended in 1 mL dimethylformamide and sonicated for 3 min using a finger sonicator (Sonics Vibra Cell, Newtown, CT, USA, 500 W, 20 kHz, ampl. 30%). Afterwards, 20 µl from these suspensions were drop-casted on the clean GC electrode and dried at room temperature.
