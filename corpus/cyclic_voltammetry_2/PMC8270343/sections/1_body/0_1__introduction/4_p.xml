<p>In our research, we have performed a ball milling treatment in order to prepare nitrogen-doped graphene from graphite and melamine as nitrogen source. In addition to the advantage of obtaining large quantities of functionalized graphene-based materials, this protocol allows the development of materials by a green approach (a clean and safe chemistry), without the employment of polluting solvents. Four types of N-doped graphene with N wt.% between 8.34 and 13.1 have been obtained and their ORR performance has been evaluated using cyclic voltammetry and rotating disk electrode protocols. To determine the correlation of the ORR catalytic performance with the materials’ structure, we analysed the hybrid materials by different methods, including transmission and scanning electron microscopy (TEM, SEM), thermogravimetric measurements (TGA), elemental analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy. Moreover, to facilitate the materials’ design and to establish the best synthesis conditions, the machine learning algorithms have been trained on variables containing as input the data that combine both the experimental conditions and different characterization parameters, and as output the number of electrons transferred during the ORR process. The predicted results were then used to identify the optimization of material properties and the best synthesis conditions by applying the reverse engineering process.</p>
