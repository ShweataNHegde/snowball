<p>In recent years, research aimed at the development of efficient and inexpensive oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts has involved the use of the N-doped graphene materials, coupled or not with some transitional metals, such as iron or cobalt [

 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-03858" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Due to the electronic interaction between the lone pair electrons of nitrogen and the pi-electronic system of the graphitic structure, these materials exhibited electrocatalytic performance towards ORR that was comparable with the Pt/C catalyst [
