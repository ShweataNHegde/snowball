<p>The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a kinetically slow process, requiring a transfer up to four electrons and four protons, and at least three intermediates are involved during the catalytic procedure [

 <sup>−</sup> reaction pathway is preferred to the 2e
 <sup>−</sup> one yielding to water molecules, and it9 is considered a plausible pathway for ORR on doped graphene in both acid and alkaline media [

However, there are still debates related to the nature of the active sites for ORR contained in the nitrogen-doped carbon materials; some studies indicate the graphitic N, while others consider the pyridinic N or pyrrolic N as the active centers in the ORR process [

Moreover, different opinions are pointed out related to the significance of nitrogen percentages from N-doped materials onto their ORR catalytic performances; there are voices claiming improvements of catalytic activity with increases in the amount of nitrogen, while others consider the active center contents as being the key for catalytic performance [
