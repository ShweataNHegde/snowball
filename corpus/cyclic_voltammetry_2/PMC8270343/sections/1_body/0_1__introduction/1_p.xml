 <xref rid="B2-molecules-26-03858" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-03858" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Due to the atomic size similarity of the carbon and nitrogen atoms, N-doping of the graphene sheets can be easily produced by direct synthesis when chemical vapor deposition (CVD), segregation growth, solvothermal or arc-discharge approaches are considered, or by post-synthesis techniques such as thermal, plasma or hydrazine treatments [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-26-03858" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Using these methods, several N-bonding configurations are attained in the N-doped graphene structure; the four common configurations are N graphitic (or quaternary N), N pyrrolic, N pyridinic and pyridinic N-oxide (pyridinic-N-O) [

In many cases, this control is still challenging and good results are even more important, especially when large-scale production and environmentally friendly methods are involved. The mechanical ball milling procedure is considered as a green and accessible approach for graphene preparation [
