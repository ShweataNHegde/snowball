<p id="Par6">The rapid development of portable and wearable electronics has triggered intensive research activities on various energy conversion and storage devices [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Metal–air batteries, especially flexible Zn–air batteries (ZABs) have been considered as promising candidates owing to their high theoretical specific energy density (1084 Wh kg
 <sup>−1</sup>), source abundance in nature, environmental benignity and high safety [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Nevertheless, the wide application of the ZABs is still hampered by the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the air cathode during the discharging and charging processes, arising from the multistep and proton-coupled electron transfer characters of the reversible oxygen electrocatalysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Currently, the noble metal Pt and metal oxides RuO
 <sub>2</sub>/IrO
 <sub>2</sub> are the most accepted benchmark electrocatalysts for ORR and OER, respectively. However, these precious metal-based catalysts are plagued with high cost, severe scarcity and chemical susceptibility. In addition, their insufficient catalytic bifunctionality and inferior durability are also the shot-slab [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It is thus imperative to develop highly efficient bifunctional non-precious metal catalysts for rechargeable ZABs.
