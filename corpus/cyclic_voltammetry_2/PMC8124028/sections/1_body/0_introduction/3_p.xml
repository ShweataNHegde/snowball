<p id="Par8">At present, various strategies have been applied to synthesize bimetal alloy composite catalysts. High-temperature pyrolysis of the mixture of metal salts and nitrogen-rich small molecules provides a straightforward approach to prepare bimetal alloys supported in N-doped carbon (NC) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Although the one-step pyrolysis of the mixture is a facile approach, the control of nanoparticle size and structure has become challenging. Moreover, the nanocrystals are prone to aggregate into bulk phase during the carbonization at high temperatures, leading to decreased electrocatalytic performance. Whereas the pyrolysis at low temperatures could moderate agglomeration, it would lead to low degree of graphitization and poor contact between active metal nanoparticles and underlying carbon, which also reduces the activity and stability of the catalyst materials [

MOFs can be utilized as excellent self-sacrificial templates in view of their tunable central metals, abundant heteroatoms, and uniform porous structures. However, the integration of two or more metals into a single MOF is usually difficult because of the mononuclear metal center of most simple MOFs [
