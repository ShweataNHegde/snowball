<p id="Par9">To fabricate flexible ZABs, the solid-state electrolyte (i.e., hydrogel electrolyte) is an essential component, which largely governs the transport behavior of conductive ions and cycling stability of flexible ZABs. The low water take-up and retention, weak interaction with electrodes, and structural instability intrinsically associated with common polymer electrolytes, e.g., polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyethylene glycol, and gelatin have significantly limited their performance in solid-state batteries [

As a promising candidate of hydrogel electrolytes, the PANa-based electrolyte exhibits superior properties of water retention, ionic conductivity, electrode/electrolyte contact, and mechanical strength [
