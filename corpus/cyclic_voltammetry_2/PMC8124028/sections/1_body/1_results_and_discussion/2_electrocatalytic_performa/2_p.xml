<p id="Par18">Electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were analyzed to further understand the partial underlying reason for the enhanced OER activity. ECSA was estimated based on the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (

 <sub>dl</sub> value of Co/CoFe@NC is 22.8 mF cm
 <sup>−2</sup>, which is the largest among all examined samples. It indicates that the introduction of Fe can provide more electrochemically accessible active sites. The Nyquist plots (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e) reveal that all catalysts have a semicircle at the high frequency region associated with charge transfer. Notably, the Co/CoFe@NC possesses the smallest semicircle diameter (

 <sub>ct</sub> = 8.9 Ω), confirming its faster charge transfer and lower electrode/electrolyte interfacial resistance [
