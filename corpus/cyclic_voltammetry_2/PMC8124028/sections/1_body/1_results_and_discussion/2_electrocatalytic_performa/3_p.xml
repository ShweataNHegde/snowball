<p id="Par19">Aside from high OER activity, the long-term stability of Co/CoFe@NC was also examined. As displayed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>f, after successive CV scans for 2000 cycles at a scan rate of 100 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup>, the polarization curve shows negligible difference as compared with the initial one. The inset of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>f shows the time-dependent current density curve of Co/CoFe@NC at a static potential of 1.5 V, and the material electrode maintains its catalytic activity for at least 20 h.
