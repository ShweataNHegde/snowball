 <sub>2</sub> electrode were evaluated in 1 M KOH at a scan rate of 2 mV s

  <italic>x</italic>

 <sup>−2</sup> (

 <sub>
  <italic>j</italic>=10
 </sub>) at the lowest overpotential of 300 mV, which is even superior to the benchmark RuO
 <sub>2</sub> catalyst. The Tafel plots extracted from recorded LSV curves are used to probe the kinetics and intrinsic activities of electrocatalysts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). Likewise, the Co/CoFe@NC exhibits the lowest Tafel slope of 49 mV dec
 <sup>−1</sup>, smaller than the benchmark RuO
 <sub>2</sub> catalyst and other contrast samples. To reflect the performance difference more intuitively, the overpotentials at 10 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup> and Tafel slopes of as-prepared catalysts are summarized in Fig. S5, confirming further the favorable OER activity and reaction kinetics at the Co/CoFe@NC.
