<p id="Par33">The flexible nature of the PANa-based electrolyte renders good flexibility to the ZAB as evidenced by the stable charge and discharge voltages under different bending states (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>f). The good flexibility of the ZAB is also proved by charge–discharge within a large current density range under different bending states (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>g). Finally, as a demonstration, two prototypical flexible ZABs connected in series can power the red LED screen of 2.5 V and simultaneously light up three LED indicators (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>h–j). These results clearly demonstrate the promising applications of our bifunctional electrocatalyst in a variety of wearable ZABs and other portable metal–air batteries.
