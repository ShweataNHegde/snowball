<p id="Par31">The Co/CoFe@NC catalyst was also assembled into a flexible quasi-solid-state ZAB to investigate its application for flexible devices. As illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>a, the catalyst-loaded carbon cloth serves as the air cathode, and the zinc-deposited carbon cloth (Fig. S11) is employed as the flexible anode. Furthermore, we prepared sodium polyacrylate hydrogel (PANa) with good alkaline-tolerance, stretchability, and water-retention capability as a promising quasi-solid-state electrolyte [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] to overcome the disadvantages of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) polymer electrolytes used commonly. Figures 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>b and S12 show the mechanical property of the PANa hydrogel with 6 M KOH and 0.2 M Zn(CH

 <sub>2</sub> intake, which is easily stretched, compressed, bended and twisted without any breakage or visible cracking, thus establishing its excellent mechanical property and alkaline tolerance. The PANa-based hydrogel also exhibits an excellent water intake capacity with 68.3% water retention after exposure in air over 10 days (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>c and S13). In contrast, the conventional PVA containing 1 M KOH begins to dry up after 12 h and only 16.1% water can be retained after exposure in air over 2 days. The excellent water holding ability of PANa-based electrolyte guarantees a larger ionic conductivity of 175 than 75 mS cm
