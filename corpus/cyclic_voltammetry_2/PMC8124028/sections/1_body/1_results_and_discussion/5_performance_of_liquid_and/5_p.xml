<p id="Par32">As a result, the ZAB assembled with PANa-based hydrogel exhibits excellent cyclability. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>e, the initial charge and discharge voltages are 2.03 and 1.16 V, respectively, corresponding to a charge/discharge overpotential of 0.87 V with a round-trip efficiency of 57%. After 550 cycles over 92 h at 5 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup>, the charge and discharge voltages only slightly change to 2.05 and 1.06 V, corresponding to a round-trip efficiency of 52%. In contrast, the ZAB assembled with PVA-based electrolyte shows severely deteriorated performance with the charge voltage increasing from 2.14 to 2.69 V and the discharge voltage decreasing from 1.01 to 0.76 V after only 150 cycles.
