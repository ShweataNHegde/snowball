<p id="Par30">The battery with Co/CoFe@NC also possesses good rate performance. As observed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>g, the discharge plateau decreases with increasing the current density and the rate performance of the battery with Co/CoFe@NC is superior to that with Pt/C + RuO
 <sub>2</sub> especially at the current density larger than 20 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup>. Based on the mass of zinc, the specific capacities of our liquid ZAB are calculated to be 775.2, 719.7, and 694.5 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> at current densities of 10, 30, and 50 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup>, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>h). It is worth to note that the specific capacity of 775.5 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 10 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup> is 94.5% of the theoretical capacity (820 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>) based on total Zn consumption.
