<p id="Par28">Considering the highly efficient bifunctional catalytic activity of Co/CoFe@NC, a homemade aqueous rechargeable ZAB was assembled with the catalyst-loaded carbon paper with gas diffusion layer as the air cathode and a polished zinc foil as the anode in electrolyte solution containing 6.0 M KOH and 0.2 M Zn(CH
 <sub>3</sub>COO)
 <sub>2</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a). For comparison, a battery employing a mixed composite of commercial Pt/C and RuO
 <sub>2</sub> (with a 1:1 weight ratio) as an air electrode was also assembled. The Co/CoFe@NC-based battery affords a higher open-circuit voltage of 1.49 V than Pt/C + RuO
 <sub>2</sub>-based battery of 1.41 V (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>c displays the galvanodynamic charge and discharge curves of the two air electrodes. A narrower voltage gap between the charge and discharge polarization voltages is found for Co/CoFe@NC, implying its better rechargeable capability than Pt/C + RuO
 <sub>2</sub>. Additionally, the Co/CoFe@NC air electrode delivers a higher peak power density (146.6 mW cm
 <sup>−2</sup>) than the noble-metal benchmark (117.3 mW cm
 <sup>−2</sup>), demonstrating further its superior catalytic activity.
