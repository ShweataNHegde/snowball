<p id="Par27">For the intimate contact between the supported metallic nanoparticles and the NC layer, the charge transfer between the two components was also simulated. As shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>e, electrons are transferred from the CoFe layer to the NC layer, causing an electron-rich state on the NC layer, which is favorable for the ORR/OER process by rapid electron release. The charge delocalization is also beneficial to the formation of abundant surface catalytic active centers [
