<p id="Par26">When the applied potential increases to 1.72 V that corresponds to a theoretical overpotential of 0.49 V, the highest ΔG value of the OER elementary steps (i.e., step 3) decreases to 0 eV. It suggests that the entire OER process can proceed spontaneously on the surface of CoFe@NC over this potential (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>d). For Co@NC, RDS is still hampered by an obvious energy barrier, requiring a higher applied potential to overcome. Thus, the comparison between Co@NC and CoFe@NC, from both theoretical and experimental analyses, points out the importance of engineering the Co/CoFe heterostructures for reducing the OER barrier and accelerating the reaction kinetic.
