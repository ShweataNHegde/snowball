<p id="Par25">The theoretical structure models of the OER intermediates adsorbed on the surfaces of Co@NC and CoFe@NC catalysts are presented in Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a, b and S10. When a potential of 0 V is applied, both catalysts display uphill pathways (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c), where the step with maximum free energy change is the rate-determining step (RDS). The RDS at pristine Co@NC is found to be the formation of *OOH from *O group in step 3 with a high overpotential of 2.06 V. This is consistent with the result of earlier study that the catalyst can bind O too strongly and the overall reaction is limited by the formation of *OOH species [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Interestingly, the binding strength of OER intermediates can be modulated by introducing alien elements, which promotes the activity of catalyst [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. By comparing the free energy profiles in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c, CoFe@NC exhibits a lowered OER overpotential of 1.77 V for the RDS of *OOH formation step, confirming the improved OER performance after the incorporation of Fe atom into the Co@NC. On the other hand, the energy barrier for O
 <sub>2</sub> desorption is altered in an opposite trend with the value increasing from 0.3 eV on Co@NC surface to 0.75 eV on CoFe@NC surface.
