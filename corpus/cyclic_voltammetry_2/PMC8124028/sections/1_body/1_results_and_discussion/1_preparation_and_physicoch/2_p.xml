 </sub> nanoparticles embedded in N-doped porous carbon nanosheets (In the following study, the Co/CoFe@NC signifies a sample with optimized content of Fe, while the Co/CoFe
 <sub>L</sub>@NC and Co/CoFe
 <sub>H</sub>@NC denote samples with low and high contents of Fe, respectively). During this pyrolysis process, metal ions were reduced to the metallic state through a carbothermal reduction reaction with the organic ligands, which in turn can catalyze the growth of graphitic carbon layers on their surface. As contrast samples, the monometallic Co@NC, Fe@NC and undecorated NC catalysts were also prepared through a similar method (see the Supporting Information).
