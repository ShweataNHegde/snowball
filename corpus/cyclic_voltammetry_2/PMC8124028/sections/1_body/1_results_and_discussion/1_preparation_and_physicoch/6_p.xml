<p id="Par16">X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed to analyze surface elemental compositions and bonding configurations of Co/CoFe@NC. The survey XPS spectra in Fig. S4 affirms the existence of C, N, O, Co, and Fe elements and the atomic percentage of respective elements is listed in the inset table. The high-resolution C 1
 <italic>s</italic> XPS spectrum (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c) can be deconvoluted into three subpeaks including C–C/C=C (284.6 eV), C=N/C–O (286.9 eV) and C–N/C = O (289.4 eV). The detected C-N component indicates that the N element has been successfully doped into the carbon lattice [

 <italic>s</italic> core level spectrum in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d. The subpeaks of N 1
 <italic>s</italic> XPS spectrum located at 398.5, 399.7, 400.3, 401.1, and 403.3 eV can be assigned to pyridinic-N, metal-N, pyrrolic-N, graphitic-N, and oxidized-N, respectively. The incorporation of N can modulate the charge distribution and spin density of the adjacent C atoms to produce Lewis base sites, thus enhancing the electrochemical performance [

 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e, the Co 2
 <italic>p</italic> XPS spectrum exhibits two pairs of peaks. The first pair of peaks centered at 779.1 and 793.9 eV are assigned to zero-valence Co atom in metallic Co and CoFe alloy [

 <italic>p</italic> in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>f discloses the metallic state peaks at 720.1 and 709.2 eV and ionic-state peaks at 710.9 and 724.8 eV with shakeup satellite peaks at 714.4 and 732.5 eV, which are attributed to metallic Fe and Fe–N bonding, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The formation of Co–N and Fe–N bonding further demonstrates the strong interaction between Co/CoFe nanoparticles and N-doped carbon nanosheet, which can facilitate electron transfer and reduce interfacial resistance.
