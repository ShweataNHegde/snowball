<p id="Par13">The crystal structure of the as-prepared materials was first characterized by XRD technology. The results (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a) illustrate the phase transition from metallic Co to CoFe alloy by varying Fe proportion in the Co/Fe

 </sub>-PPD precursor. With an appropriate amount of incorporated Fe, the XRD pattern confirms the formation of mixed crystal phases with metallic Co (JCPDS No. 15–0806) and face-centered cubic (
 <italic>fcc</italic>) CoFe alloy (JCPDS No. 48-1818) [

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, it is clear that two prominent peaks located at around 1335 and 1590 cm

 <sub>G</sub> ratio of Co/CoFe@NC (
