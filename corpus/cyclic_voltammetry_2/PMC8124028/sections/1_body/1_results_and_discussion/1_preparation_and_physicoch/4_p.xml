<p id="Par14">The morphology and microstructure of Co/CoFe@NC were examined by means of electron microscopies. As seen by SEM images in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, d, the Co/CoFe@NC preserves well the nanoflower morphology of Co-PPD precursor with an average size of 500 nm, which is assembled by dozens of 2D nanosheets. A great deal of well-dispersed nanoparticles with a size of approximate 10 nm are imbedded in the nanosheets. Similar observations are made on Co@NC, Co/CoFe
 <sub>L</sub>@NC, and Co/CoFe
 <sub>H</sub>@NC (Fig. S2), whereas Fe@NC displays nanowire morphology (Fig. S3). In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of Co/CoFe@NC also reveals the presence of a large number of nanoparticles in nanosheets. The inset shows the selected-area-electron-diffraction (SAED) pattern, confirming the polycrystalline nature of the material as indicated by the discrete spots. Furthermore, the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f) demonstrates that the nanoparticles are surrounded by a few graphitic carbon layers. Such confinement effect not only prevents the Co/CoFe nanoparticles from agglomeration and detachment during the catalysis cycling, but also enriches the electron density on the carbon surface, thus inducing extra surface catalysis from carbon matrix (see theoretical calculation below). Interestingly, the Co/CoFe heterostructure is formed in a single nanoparticle as marked by the white lines. The lattice fringes with spacings of 0.17 and 0.20 nm can be readily assigned to the (200) plane of Co and the (110) plane of CoFe, respectively, which are consistent with the results of XRD [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. As reported, the heterostructure interfaces can enrich the catalytic active sites and promote the charge transfer between different components, thus enhancing the electrocatalytic performance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The high-angle annular dark-field TEM (HAADF TEM) image and the corresponding element mappings (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>g–k) illustrate that the N, Co, and Fe elements are homogeneously dispersed throughout the entire carbon sheet.
