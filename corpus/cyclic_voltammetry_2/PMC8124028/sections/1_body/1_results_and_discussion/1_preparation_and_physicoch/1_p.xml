<p id="Par11">The synthesis process of Co/CoFe@NC can be divided into three major steps as illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Initially, a convenient solvothermal method was utilized to prepare Co-based coordination framework (denoted as Co-PPD) via the strong coordination interaction between the Co
 <sup>2+</sup> ions and the amine functional group in 
 <italic>p</italic>-phenylenediamine (PPD). As shown in Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra (Fig. S1a), the peaks of Co-PPD at high wavenumber that arise from the stretching vibrations of the -N–H group become weaker as compared with the pure PPD. It signifies that the metal ions are anchored into the “nitrogen pots” in the Co-PPD [

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images clearly show the nanoflower structure of Co-PPD comprised of numerous nanosheets (Figs. S1c, d). The corresponding X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping reveals the coexistence of C, N, and Co elements and their homogenous distribution in the whole sample (Figs. S1e-h).
