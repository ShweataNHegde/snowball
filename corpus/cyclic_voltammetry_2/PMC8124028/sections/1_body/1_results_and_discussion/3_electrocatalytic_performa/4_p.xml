<p id="Par23">The bifunctionality of oxygen electrocatalysts were assessed by the voltage difference (∆

 <italic>E</italic>

 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>j</italic>=10
 </sub> for OER, in which the smaller ∆
 <italic>E</italic> indicates the limited electrochemical polarization and higher bifunctional activity. Remarkably, the Co/CoFe@NC affords the lowest ∆
 <italic>E</italic> of 0.70 V among various Co/CoFe

 </sub>-based samples and noble-metal catalysts (Fig.

 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>f summarizes the bifunctional electrocatalytic activity of as-prepared Co/CoFe@NC with those of recently reported composite catalysts based on transition metals (note detailed information in Table S1), corroborating an extraordinary reversible oxygen catalytic performance of Co/CoFe@NC.
