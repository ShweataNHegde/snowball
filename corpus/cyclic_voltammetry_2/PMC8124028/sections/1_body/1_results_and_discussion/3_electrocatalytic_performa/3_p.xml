<p id="Par22">The Co/CoFe@NC catalyst also exhibits superior ORR stability, which is very important for the practical application of electrocatalysts. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d, the relative activity of the Co/CoFe@NC catalyst remains 98% after 24 h of continuous operation at 0.65 V, far superior to 63% retention of Pt/C. The activity degradation of Pt/C could be at least partially attributed to the detachment of Pt nanoparticles from carbon supports, leading to agglomeration of nanoparticles, catalyst compaction and porosity loss [

 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d inset) remain quite consistent, suggesting further the excellent durability of Co/CoFe@NC. Because ORR is also an important half reaction in fuel cells, such as direct methanol fuel cell, the methanol crossover tolerance of Co/CoFe@NC was examined and compared with commercial Pt/C catalyst (Fig. S9). By spiking methanol into the electrolyte solution, the cathodic ORR current at Pt/C immediately changes to an anodic current owing to methanol oxidation, indicating severe disturbance of ORR by methanol crossover. By contrast, no significant current variation is observed for Co/CoFe@NC, suggesting the excellent methanol tolerance of Co/CoFe@NC.
