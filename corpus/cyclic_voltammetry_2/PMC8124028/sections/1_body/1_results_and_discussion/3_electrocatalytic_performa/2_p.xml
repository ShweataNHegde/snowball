<p id="Par21">To quantitatively evaluate the intermediate peroxide product, the rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) measurements were also performed. As displayed in Fig. S8, the Co/CoFe@NC shows a high electron transfer number over 3.9 per O

 <sup>‒</sup> yield below 5.0% in a wide potential range (0.2–0.8 V), both of which are superior to those of contrast catalysts and comparable to that of benchmark Pt/C. This result is in good agreement with the
