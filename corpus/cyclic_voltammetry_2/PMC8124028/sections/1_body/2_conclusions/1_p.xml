<p id="Par34">In summary, a strategy of coordination construction-cation exchange-pyrolysis is developed to fabricate heterostructured Co/CoFe nanoparticles embedded in N-doped graphitic carbon (NC) with a novel nanoflower structure. The synthesized catalyst delivers extraordinary ORR/OER bifunctional electrocatalytic performance with a small ∆

Experimental and theoretical results collectively demonstrate the critical role of the heterointerface engineering of Co/CoFe nanoparticles and strong catalyst–support interaction in boosting the catalytic activity and stability. The assembled rechargeable ZAB employing the Co/CoFe@NC catalyst exhibits high specific capacity, low charge and discharge overpotential and exceptionally stable cyclability over 360 h (15 days), outperforming noble-metal benchmarks and other recently reported results. Furthermore, the Co/CoFe@NC and PANa hydrogel electrolyte are integrated into a flexible quasi-solid-state ZAB, demonstrating an excellent cycling performance and a good round-trip efficiency even under bending states. This study develops an excellent bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst for ZABs by collective morphology-composition-structure engineering, and is significant for advanced flexible and wearable energy-storage devices.
