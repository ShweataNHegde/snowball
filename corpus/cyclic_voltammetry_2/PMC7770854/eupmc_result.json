However, the further development of ZIBs is impeded by two main challenges: Currently reported cathode materials usually suffer from rapid capacity fading or high toxicity, and meanwhile, unstable zinc stripping/plating on Zn anode seriously shortens the cycling life of ZIBs. In this paper, metal-organic framework (MOF) materials are proposed to simultaneously address these issues and realize high-performance ZIBs with Mn(BTC) MOF cathodes and ZIF-8-coated Zn (ZIF-8@Zn) anodes. Various MOF materials were synthesized, and Mn(BTC) MOF was found to exhibit the best Zn<sup>2+</sup>-storage ability with a capacity of 112\u00a0mAh\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup>. Zn<sup>2+</sup> storage mechanism of the Mn(BTC) was carefully studied. Besides, ZIF-8@Zn anodes were prepared by coating ZIF-8 MOF material on Zn foils. Unique porous structure of the ZIF-8 coating guided uniform Zn stripping/plating on the surface of Zn anodes. As a result, the ZIF-8@Zn anodes exhibited stable Zn stripping/plating behaviors, with 8 times longer cycle life than bare Zn foils. Based on the above, high-performance aqueous ZIBs were constructed using the Mn(BTC) cathodes and the ZIF-8@Zn anodes, which displayed an excellent long-cycling stability without obvious capacity fading after 900 charge/discharge cycles.
