<p id="Par14">Electrochemical behaviors of the ZIF-8@Zn anodes were characterized through ZIF-8@Zn||ZIF-8@Zn symmetrical cells, in which both the negative and positive electrodes were a ZIF-8@Zn disk (with diameter of 12 mm), air-laid paper was used as the separator, and 2 M ZnSO
 <sub>4</sub> (or 2 M ZnSO
 <sub>4</sub> + 0.1 M MnSO
 <sub>4</sub>) aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte. For comparison, Zn||ZnSO
 <sub>4</sub>||Zn symmetrical cells were also assembled, in which pure Zn foils served as Zn electrodes. Electrochemical stability of these symmetric cells was evaluated by GCD tests at different current densities of 0.25–2 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup> and different charge/discharge capacities of 0.05–0.4 mAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup> on a LAND CT2001 battery tester. The impedance measurements of symmetrical cells were taken on a VMP3 multichannel electrochemical station (Bio-Logic Science Instruments SA) between 300 kHz and 0.01 Hz.
