<p id="Par13">The electrochemical performance of various MOF cathodes was evaluated in CR2032 coin cells with zinc foil anode, air-laid paper separator, and 2 M ZnSO
 <sub>4</sub> aqueous electrolyte. To prepare the MOF cathodes, the synthesized MOF powder was mixed with acetylene black and PVDF with a weight ratio of 7:2:1 in NMP solvent and then coated onto a stainless-steel current collector and dried at 80 °C overnight. The mass loading of MOF materials on current collectors is about 1.0 mg cm
 <sup>−2</sup>. For the assembled cells, cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were carried out on a VMP3 multichannel electrochemical station (Bio-Logic Science Instruments SA) at a sweep rate of 0.5 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup>, and galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) tests were performed on a LAND CT2001 battery tester at current density of 50 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>.
