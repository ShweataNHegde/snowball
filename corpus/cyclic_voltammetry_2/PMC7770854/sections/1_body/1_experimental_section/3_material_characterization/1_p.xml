<p id="Par12">Crystallographic and structure analysis was carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku 2500, Cu Kα radiation, 
 <italic>λ</italic> = 0.154056 nm) with a scan rate of 5° min
 <sup>−1</sup> over 2-theta ranging from 5° to 70°. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) was performed on a Zeiss Supra55 scanning electron microscope. Elemental analysis was characterized by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) on the FE-SEM. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250X, Thermo Fisher, United Kingdom) was used for characterizing the valence variation. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR, Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS 50) spectroscopy was used to identify functional groups in the MOF materials at pristine state and various charge/discharge states. Element content in electrolytes was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES).
