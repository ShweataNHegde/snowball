 <sub>3</sub>COO)
 <sub>2</sub>·4H
 <sub>2</sub>O and 300 mg polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) were dissolved in ethanol/H
 <sub>2</sub>O (125/125 mL) to get solution A, and meanwhile, 2250 mg trimesic acid (H
 <sub>3</sub>BTC) was dissolved in another ethanol/H
 <sub>2</sub>O (125/125 mL) system to get solution B. Then, solution B was added slowly into solution A under continuous stirring. After 10 min, the reaction mixture was aged without interruption for 24 h. The products were collected after centrifugation, washing several times with ethanol and complete drying in an oven at 60 °C. Fe(BDC), Mn(BDC), Co(BDC), and V(BDC) were synthesized according to previously reported methods [
