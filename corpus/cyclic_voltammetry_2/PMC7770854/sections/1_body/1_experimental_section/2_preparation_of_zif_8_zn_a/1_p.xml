<p id="Par11">ZIF-8 was purchased from J&amp;K Scientific Ltd. The as-received ZIF-8 and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) were mixed with a mass ratio of 8:2 in 
 <italic>N</italic>-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent to form a homogeneous slurry. Then, the slurry was uniformly coated onto a Zn foil and dried at 80 °C overnight in a vacuum to obtain the ZIF-8-coated Zn (i.e., ZIF-8@Zn) anodes, in which the mass of the ZIF-8 coating was about 1.1 mg cm
