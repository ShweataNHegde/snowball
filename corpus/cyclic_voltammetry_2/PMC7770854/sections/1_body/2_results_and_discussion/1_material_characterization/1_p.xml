<p id="Par16">Structure and morphology of the as-synthesized MOF materials including Mn(BTC), Mn(BDC), Fe(BDC), Co(BDC), and V(BDC) were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Figures 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a–e and S1 display that the Mn(BTC) and Fe(BDC) are composed of spherical and octahedral particles with size of 1–10 μm, respectively, and the other three MOF samples have irregular-shaped micromorphologies. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f and Fig. S2, the XRD patterns of the synthesized MOF materials are consistent with previously reported literature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], indicating that Mn(BTC), Mn(BDC), Fe(BDC), Co(BDC), and V(BDC) MOFs were successfully synthesized. The crystalline structures of these MOF materials are depicted in Fig. S3.
