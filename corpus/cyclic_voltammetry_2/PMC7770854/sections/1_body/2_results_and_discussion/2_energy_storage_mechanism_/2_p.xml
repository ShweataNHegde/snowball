<p id="Par19">To figure out what the “rod-like” and “nanoflower-like” compounds (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b, c) are, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were further carried out in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. The high-resolution Mn 2
 <italic>p</italic> XPS spectrum of the Mn(BTC) cathode at fully charged state (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a) shows that the Mn 2
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>3/2</sub> and Mn 2
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>1/2</sub> peaks situate at 642.1 and 653.8 eV, respectively, with the peak separation of 11.7 eV. These values are consistent with the reported parameters for MnO
 <sub>2</sub> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Considering that these “nanoflower-like” particles contain Mn element while “rod-like” particles do not (as discussed in Fig. S5a), the “nanoflower-like” particles are determined to be MnO
 <sub>2</sub>. In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b, peak separation of Mn 3
 <italic>s</italic> orbit decreases from 6.4 eV for the original Mn(BTC) cathode to 4.7 eV for the fully charged Mn(BTC) cathode, indicating the increase in the Mn oxidation state after charging process [

 <italic>s</italic> core-level spectrum in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c can be divided into four main peaks. Especially, the peak centered at 529.7 eV is in accord with the typical bond of Mn–O–Mn [
