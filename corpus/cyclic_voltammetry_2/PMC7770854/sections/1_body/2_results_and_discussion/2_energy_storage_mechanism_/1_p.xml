 <sup>2+</sup>-storage mechanism of the Mn(BTC) cathode in ZnSO
 <sub>4</sub> electrolyte is further investigated. Evolution of the phase composition and micromorphology of the Mn(BTC) electrode during Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> storage-release processes were characterized by XRD and SEM, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. When the fresh Mn(BTC) cathode is charged to 1.9 V at 50 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>, “nanoflower-like” and “rod-like” particles appear (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). The “nanoflower” particles densely distribute on the surface of the electrode. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis in Fig. S5 points out that the “nanoflower” particles contain Mn and O elements, and the main composition elements of the “rod-like” particles are C, O, and Zn. When the Mn(BTC) cathode is then discharged to 1.0 V (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c), the “rod-like” particles still exist, but the “nanoflower-like” particles disappear, and meanwhile, some large flakes form. The XRD results of the cathode at different charge–discharge states are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d. Compared with the original state, XRD pattern of the Mn(BTC) cathode at the fully charged state (i.e., 1.9 V) shows obvious differences. The main peaks (at 10.4°, 20.8°, 29.4°, 38.0°, and 42.4°) of the Mn(BTC) disappear, and some new peaks emerge (at 17.5°, 18.6°, 21.9°, 26.4°, 27.0°, and 35.5°), which means that there arises a phase transition reaction and new phases form undergoing charging. XRD pattern at the fully discharged state (i.e., 1.0 V) shows the characteristic diffraction peaks of ZnSO
 <sub>4</sub>·3Zn(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>·5H
 <sub>2</sub>O (denoted as BZSP). Therefore, the above-mentioned large flakes in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c are considered as BZSP. Besides, from the fully charged state to the fully discharged state, some diffraction peaks (e.g., at 17.5°, 18.6°, 26.4°, 27.0°, and 35.5°) of the cathode remain unchanged positions. No PDF cards of MnO
 <sub>2</sub> can match well with these diffraction peaks, and they still remain their positions at the fully discharged state, so these diffraction peaks do not belong to MnO
 <sub>2</sub>. These diffraction peaks are thought to originate from the “rod-like” particles that are observed in Fig.
