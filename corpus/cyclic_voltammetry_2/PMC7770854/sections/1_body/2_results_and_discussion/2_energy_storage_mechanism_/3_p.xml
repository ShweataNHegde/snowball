<p id="Par20">FTIR spectra of the Mn(BTC) cathode at original, charging, and discharging states are presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d. In the FTIR spectrum of the original Mn(BTC), the absorption peaks of O–H at 3082 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and C=O at 1720 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> from 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid disappear, while the asymmetric stretching vibrations of –COO– and symmetric stretching vibrations of –COO– are detected in the regions of 1612–1545 and 1433–1372 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. This is an evidence that the manganese ions have been successfully coordinated with the 1,3,5-BTC ligands in the Mn(BTC) material [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. When the Mn(BTC) is charged to 1.9 V, the asymmetric stretching vibration of –COO– at 1612 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> shifts to a new band at 1628 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. Meanwhile, the symmetric stretching vibration of –COO– at 1372 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> shifts to a new band at 1383 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. They are coordination characteristic bands of Zn(BTC) MOF materials [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. These suggest that zinc-ion substitute manganese-ion to be coordinated with -COOH to form Zn(BTC). When the Mn(BTC) cathode is then discharged to 1.0 V, there is no distinct change for these typical bands, suggesting that Zn(BTC) remains stable during discharge process.
