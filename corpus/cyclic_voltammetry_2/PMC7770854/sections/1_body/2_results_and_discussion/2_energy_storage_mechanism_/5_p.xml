<p id="Par22">In the above-proposed reaction pathways, the oxidation reaction from Mn(BTC) to MnO
 <sub>2</sub> plays an important role in this system. On the one hand, MnO
 <sub>2</sub> is capable of delivering a high capacity, but on the other hand, MnO
 <sub>2</sub> generally suffers from rapid capacity fading due to the dissolution of manganese from the MnO
 <sub>2</sub> electrode [

 <sub>4</sub>//Zn system as discussed in Fig.Â S4 is considered to be mainly caused by the dissolution of MnO
 <sub>2</sub>.
