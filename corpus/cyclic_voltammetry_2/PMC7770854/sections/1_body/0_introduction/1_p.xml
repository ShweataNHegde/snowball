<p id="Par6">Lithium-ion batteries have been widely used in modern society [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, security problems and increasing production cost pose challenges for their large-scale applications in the field of electric vehicles [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Researchers are committed to seeking alternative electrochemical energy storage systems to lithium-ion batteries. Many new-type rechargeable batteries using multivalent metal ions (e.g., Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>, Mg
 <sup>2+</sup>, and Al
 <sup>3+</sup>) as charge carriers have been proposed successively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Among them, rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) have been considered as highly promising candidate for the next-generation energy storage system, because they are safe, low cost, and environmental benign [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In order to meet the demands of common energy consumption, two main issues should be addressed for the ZIBs. One is exploring suitable cathode materials for the reversible intercalation/extraction of zinc-ions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and the other is exploring stable zinc metal anodes because this is essential for ZIBs to realize a long cycle life [
