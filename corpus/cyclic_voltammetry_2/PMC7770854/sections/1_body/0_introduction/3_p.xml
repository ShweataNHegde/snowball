<p id="Par8">Exploring new potential materials such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) may open opportunities for addressing these problems. MOFs are characterized by highly porous structure, designable frameworks, and multifunctionality [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. In the past two decades, MOFs have been widely used in energy storage systems such as lithium-ion batteries [

 </sub>/N-doped carbon cathode material was synthesized based on a MOF template and provided a Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>-storage capacity of 305 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> even after 600 charge/discharge cycles [

 <sup>2+</sup> solid-state electrolyte with high ionic conductivity, high Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> transference number, and good electrochemical stability was designed to achieve dendrite-free Zn batteries [
