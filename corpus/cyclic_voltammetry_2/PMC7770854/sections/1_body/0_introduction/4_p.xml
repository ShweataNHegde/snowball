<p id="Par9">Herein, we synthesized five kinds of MOFs materials, including Mn(BTC), Mn(BDC), Fe(BDC), Co(BDC), and V(BDC) (in which BDC is 1,4-dicarboxybenzene and BTC is 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid.) and investigated their electrochemical behaviors as ZIB cathodes. Among these MOFs materials, Mn(BTC) showed the best Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> storage capability. Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> storage mechanism of the Mn(BTC) cathode was then comprehensively studied. Besides, we developed a long-term stable ZIF-8@Zn anode by coating ZIF-8 material on the surface of zinc foils. Furthermore, high-performance aqueous ZIBs were constructed using the Mn(BTC) cathodes and the ZIF-8@Zn anodes, which exhibited an excellent cycling stability with 92% capacity retention after 900 charge/discharge cycles. This work opens up a new door for achieving high-performance aqueous zinc-ion batteries based on MOFs materials.
