<p id="Par26">In summary, a high-performance aqueous zinc-ion battery system was realized based on MOF materials. Several kinds of MOF materials were synthesized first and investigated as cathode materials for ZIBs. During them, Mn(BTC) MOF showed a high capacity and its Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> storage mechanism was revealed such as a transformation reaction from Mn(BTC) to MnO
 <sub>2</sub> during charge process. In addition, a porous ZIF-8 coating was utilized to protect Zn foil anodes, which led to a uniform electrolyte flux and significantly inhibited the formation of zinc protuberances/dendrites. An aqueous zinc-ion battery was constructed based on the Mn(BTC) cathode and the ZIF-8 stabilized Zn anode. Benefiting from the synergetic effect of Mn(BTC) cathode and Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> additive in the electrolyte, high capacity and excellent long-term cycling ability were simultaneously realized. This work proves that by exploring MOF materials, high-performance aqueous zinc-ion batteries can be achieved.
