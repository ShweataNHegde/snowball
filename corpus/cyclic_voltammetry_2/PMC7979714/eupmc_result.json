low-cost electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction applied to fuel cells and metal-air batteries, atomic-dispersed transition metal-nitrogen-carbon materials are emerging, but the genuine

Herein, by rational design and synthesis of dual-metal atomically dispersed Fe,Mn/N-C catalyst as model object, we unravel that the O<sub>2</sub> reduction preferentially takes place on Fe<sup>III</sup> in the FeN<sub>4</sub>\u2006/C system with intermediate spin state which possesses one e<sub>g</sub> electron (t<sub>2g</sub>4e<sub>g</sub>1) readily penetrating the antibonding \u03c0-orbital of oxygen. Both magnetic measurements and theoretical calculation reveal that the adjacent atomically dispersed Mn-N moieties can effectively activate the Fe<sup>III</sup> sites by both spin-state transition and electronic modulation, rendering the excellent ORR performances of Fe,Mn/N-C in both alkaline and acidic media (halfwave positionals are 0.928 V in 0.1 M KOH, and 0.804 V in 0.1 M HClO<sub>4</sub>), and good durability, which outperforms and has almost the same activity of commercial Pt/C, respectively. In addition, it presents a superior power density of 160.8 mW cm<sup>-2</sup> and long-term durability in reversible zinc-air batteries.
