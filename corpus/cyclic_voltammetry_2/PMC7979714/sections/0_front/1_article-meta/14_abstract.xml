 <p id="Par2">The working mechanism of several low-cost electrocatalyst materials is still arguable. Here the authors show a model Fe,Mn/N-C catalyst where the oxygen reduction preferentially takes place on Fe(III) sites with the intermediate spin state (t2g4 eg1) caused by the adjacent Mn-N moieties.</p>
