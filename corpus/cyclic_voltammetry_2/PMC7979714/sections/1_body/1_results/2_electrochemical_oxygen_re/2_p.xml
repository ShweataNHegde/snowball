 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). The stability is largely enhanced over Fe/N–C (loss 34 mV after 8000 cycles), as well as the Mn/N–C (21 mV loss) (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">18</xref>). It can be attributed to the promotion of Mn to the formation of graphitized carbon and MnO
 <sub>2</sub> during the OER process, enhancing the stability of nano-carbon with reduced carbon corrosion

 </sup>. In addition, Fe,Mn/N–C displays a benchmark chronoamperometry response extended over 40,000 s with retention of 96% of the initial current (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">19</xref>). Interestingly, Fe,Mn/N–C exhibits more stable retention of current densities without a distinct recession after methanol crossover and CO, implying strong resistance to corrosion and poisoning in acidic electrolytes (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">20</xref>), better than Pt/C (20 wt%) catalyst and control samples (Fe/N–C and Mn/N–C)

 </sup>. Significantly, Fe,Mn/N–C also presents outstanding ORR activity measured by CV, LSV, and Tafel plot in 0.1 M KOH (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">21</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">23a</xref>). It shows high ORR catalytic activity with E

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>), 97 mV superior to that of Pt/C (E
