 <sup>III</sup>, the ORR electrocatalytic activity in 0.1 HClO
 <sub>4</sub> aqueous solution of Fe,Mn/N–C was first demonstrated by compared with Fe/N–C and Mn/N–C with Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and Linear scan voltammetry (LSV) measurements

 </sup>. CV curve reveals a significant reduction peak at 0.804 V for Fe,Mn/N–C (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16</xref>), suggesting a good ORR electrocatalytic activity. LSV curves in O
 <sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1 M HClO
 <sub>4</sub> with a loading amount of 0.1 mg cm
 <sup>−2</sup> was performed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Fe,Mn/N–C obviously presents a high half-wave potential (E
 <sub>1/2</sub>) of 0.804 V (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>), which are similar to Pt/C (E
 <sub>1/2</sub> = 0.807 V), and superior to Fe/N–C (E
 <sub>1/2</sub> = 0.702 V), Mn/N–C (E
 <sub>1/2</sub> = 0.73 V) and most of non-precious metal ORR electrocatalysts (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). The ORR kinetics was further probed by the Koutecky–Levich (K–L) method (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">17</xref>) and Tafel plot (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). The electron transfer number (n) of Fe,Mn/N–C is 3.91, as evaluated according to the K-L equation

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> yield were further evaluated through rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>), where the direct four-electron transfer mediated ORR process is confirmed (the n approaches 4 and the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> yield is below 4%).
