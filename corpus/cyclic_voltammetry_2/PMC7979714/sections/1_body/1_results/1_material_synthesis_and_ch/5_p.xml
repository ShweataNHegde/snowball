 <sub>4</sub> enables it to be catalytically active in chemical reactions. The IS(δ), descriptor of the valence state of the Mossbauer absorber atom, indicates that Fe exists mainly in the form of trivalent with high crystal field stabilization energy

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>) reveals that the iron responsible for D
 <sub>1</sub>, D
 <sub>3,</sub> and D
 <sub>4</sub> makes up 13.5%, 27.1%, and 59.4%, respectively. This confirms that the Fe
 <sup>III</sup> in Fe,Mn/N–C is predominantly present as Fe
 <sup>III</sup> with the medium-spin structure.
