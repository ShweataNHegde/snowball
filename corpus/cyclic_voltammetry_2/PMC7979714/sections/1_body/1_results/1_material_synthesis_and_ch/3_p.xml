<p id="Par9">The chemical composition of Fe,Mn/N–C was further investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As depicted in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>, after rational doping of Mn
 <sup>III</sup> moieties, the content of graphitic N (401.63 eV) increases compared with Fe–N/C sample, implying that Mn tends to catalyze the formation of highly ordered and less defective graphitic carbon, thereby improving the stability of nanocarbons

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9a</xref>, the N 1s spectrum indicates five types of N species existing in Fe,Mn/N–C. Especially, the Fe/Mn–N
 <sub>x</sub> bond with the binding energy of 399.1 eV, associated with the abundant atomically dispersed metal-nitrogen functional moieties in Fe,Mn/N–C. The content of Fe and Mn detected by ICP analysis are 2.3 and 1.6 wt. %, respectively.
