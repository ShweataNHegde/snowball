<p id="Par13">To probe the interaction between anchored Fe and Mn, the density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level, mainly originated from the 3

 </sup>. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">15</xref>, obviously, sharp peaks can be seen near the Fermi level for both Fe (Fe–N
 <sub>4</sub>) and Mn (Mn–N
 <sub>4</sub>), and the peaks for Fe are more sharply. These indicated that the interaction between Fe and the coming O
 <sub>2</sub> are stronger than that on Mn. For Fe,Mn/N
 <sub>6</sub>-1, clearly differences can be seen, there are obvious overlapping between Fe 3
 <italic>d</italic> and Mn 3
 <italic>d</italic>, which reflected the interaction by the neighboring atom. In addition, it is supposed that the antibonding state of Fe/N–C possesses low electron energy giving low-spin state, while the higher antibonding electron energy of Fe,Mn/N–C further confirming the medium-spin configuration of Fe
 <sup>III</sup> in Fe,Mn/N–C. This probably owing to that Mn
 <sup>III</sup> with higher affinity to electrons can capture electrons from Fe
 <sup>III</sup>, thus leading to redistribution electrons of Fe 3
 <italic>d</italic>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>
 </sup>. In addition, the orbital hybridization of Fe 3
 <italic>d</italic> and Mn 3
 <italic>d</italic> causes obvious band gap narrowing and electron delocalization in Fe,Mn/N–C, which increases the conduction band dispersion and reduces the large effective electron mass, thereby improving the electron transport.
