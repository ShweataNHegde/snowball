<p id="Par7">The single metal atomically dispersed Fe/N–C and Mn/N–C catalysts with the sample loading using the same method were also synthesized as controlled experiments. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of Fe,Mn/N–C show a graphene-like carbon sheet morphology with a porous structure

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, a number of bright spots are clearly observed, in which Fe/Mn atomic pairs are randomly distributed on the surface of N-doped carbon as highlighted by red cycles, attributed to heavy Fe, Mn than light N, C atoms

 <sub>4</sub> is adjacent to Fe–N
 <sub>4</sub>, the atomic-resolution HAADF-STEM of Fe–N–C and Mn–N–C catalysts have been additionally carried out. As displayed in Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>, isolated single Fe or Mn atoms can be distinctly observed on the carbon support, indicating that neither atomic Fe–Fe pairs nor atomic Mn–Mn pairs form by our synthetic strategy. In contrast, when adding Mn and Fe sources stimulatingly in the synthetic system, a number of bright dual spot-pairs are clearly observed, further confirming that it forms the heterogeneous-metal- atoms pairs (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). The electron energy loss spectrum (EELS) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>) reals the coexistence of Fe and Mn elements in Fe,Mn/N–C. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d–e</xref>, a statistical analysis of more than 30 metal pairs has been conducted, which presents that the distance between the metal-pairs is 0.25 ± 0.02 nm. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>) demonstrates the lattice distortion defect characteristic, which might be attributed to the coordination of dual Fe/Mn atoms with nitrogen. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopic (EDS) elemental mapping analyses further manifest the homogeneous distribution of C, N, Fe, and Mn distribution over Fe,Mn/N–C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>). No characteristic crystal peaks of metal and metal oxides can be observed in the X-ray reduction patterns of carbonized samples, excluding the formation of large particles (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>)

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>
 </sup>. Taken together, such collective HAADF-STEM, EDS elemental mapping, EELS and the distance between the metal-pairs confirm the co-existence of Fe and Mn in a form of Fe/Mn atomic pairs
