 </sup>. Hitherto, the generally recognized state-of-the-art platinum (Pt)-based catalysts possess the highest kinetic activity in catalyzing ORR under acid and alkaline media, however, the scarcity, price, and low methanol crossover tolerance of Pt alloys have motivated the search for cost-effective non-noble-metal electrocatalysts
