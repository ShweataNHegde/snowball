<p id="Par6">Herein, we first successfully implant Mn–N moieties in the conventional Fe/N–C system, by preparing a dual-metal atomically dispersed Fe,Mn/N–C electrocatalyst with the pre-polymerization and pyrolysis processes, whereby dicyandiamide is used as C and N sources, iron phthalocyanine (FePc) and manganese nitrate (Mn(NO
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>) are selected as metal precursor. The dual-sites dispersion tagged in the N-doped defect carbon is probably originated from adsorption of Mn salts and their bonding with neighboring Fe–N
 <sub>4</sub> center (Iron phthalocyanine molecular) (Fig.

 </sup>. The introduction of Mn–N moieties causes Fe
 <sup>III</sup> electron delocalization and makes the spin state of Fe
 <sup>III</sup> transition from low spin (t
 <sub>2g</sub>5 e
 <sub>g</sub>0) to intermediate spin (t
 <sub>2g</sub>4 e
 <sub>g</sub>1), readily penetrating the antibonding π-orbital of oxygen, and thus allowing an excellent ORR activity in both 0.1 M HClO
 <sub>4</sub> and 0.1 M KOH solutions. DFT calculations reveal that Fe,Mn/N–C can interact with oxygen moderately, with appropriate bond length and adsorption energy, beneficial to promote the kinetic process of ORR.
