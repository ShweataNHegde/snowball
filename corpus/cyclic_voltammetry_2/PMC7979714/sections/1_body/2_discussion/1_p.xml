<p id="Par18">In summary, in order to take insight into the genuine mechanism of high effective atomic-dispersed M–N–C materials on ORR, dual-metal atomically dispersed Fe,Mn/N–C and the single-atom Fe/N–C and Mn/N–C catalyst were precisely design and prepared as model object, which uncover that the spin-state formation of 3

DFT theoretical calculations further confirms that the electronic structure-adjusted Fe,Mn/N–C and the oxygen intermediate have proper bond length and binding energy, which improves the reaction kinetics of ORR. As practical applications, Fe,Mn/N–C was successfully incorporated as an effective air cathode for a rechargeable flexible Zn–air battery device with long-term work stability. This work opens up new opportunities for optimizing noble-metal-free catalysts to achieve high-efficiency and stable catalysts towards fuel cells, metal–air batteries, and other renewable energy systems.
