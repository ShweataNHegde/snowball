<p id="Par27">The catalyst ink recipe consists of 5.0 mg catalyst dispersed in 480 μL of DI water/isopropyl alcohol (v/v~3:7)/20 μL Nafion (5 wt.%) solution. For the Zn–air battery test, the air electrode was prepared by uniformly coating the as-prepared catalyst ink onto carbon paper then drying it at 80 °C for 2 h. The mass loading was 0.5 mg cm
 <sup>−2</sup> unless otherwise noted. A Zn plate was used as the anode and catalysis loaded on carbon paper are used as cathodes. Both electrodes were assembled into a home-made Zn–air battery, and 6 M KOH aqueous solutions was used as the electrolyte
