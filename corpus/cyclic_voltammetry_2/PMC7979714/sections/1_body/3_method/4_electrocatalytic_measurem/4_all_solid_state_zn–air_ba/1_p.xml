<p id="Par26">A polished zinc foil (0.05 mm thickness) was used as anode. The gel polymer electrolyte was prepared as follow: polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, 5 g) was dissolved in 50 mL was added 18 M KOH (5 mL) at 95 °C to form a homogeneous viscous solution, followed by casting on a glass disk to form a thin polymer film (thickness about 2 mm). The film was then freezed in a freezer at −20 °C about 2 h, and then keep at 0 °C temperature about 4 h. The film was thawed for 12 h before used. Then, the as-prepared Fe,Mn/N–C film and zinc foil were placed on the two sides of PVA gel, followed by pressed Ni foam as current collector. The components were firmly pressed together by roll-pressing. No inert atmosphere or glove-box is required for the packaging.</p>
