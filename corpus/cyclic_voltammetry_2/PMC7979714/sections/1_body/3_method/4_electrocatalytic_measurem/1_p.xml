<p id="Par23">Electrochemical experiments were conducted on a CHI760E electrochemical workstation (CH Instrument Co., USA). CV, RDE, and RRDE measurements (Pine Research Instrument, USA) were conducted using a standard three-electrode system. All the measurements were carried out at room temperature. For the preparation of working electrode, 2 mg of catalyst was dispersed in 1 mL mixture of ethanol and 5% Nafion (v:v = 200:1) under sonication for 1 h to form a homogeneous catalyst ink. Then 10 μL of this catalyst ink was loaded onto a glassy carbon rotating disk electrode with the diameter of 5 mm, resulting in the catalyst loading of 0.1 mg cm
 <sup>−2</sup>, followed by drying at room temperature.
