<p id="Par29">A 6x6 graphene supercell (14.807 x 14.807 Å) with 12 Å vacuum layer was first constructed, and then Fe (or Mn)-N4 structure was simulated based on this model. Fe and Mn co-doped structure was then constructed. Three co-doped type was considered. A 4 x 4 K-points was used in all these calculations.</p>
