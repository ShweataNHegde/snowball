<p id="Par28">First-Principles calculations were carried out within the density functional theory framework. The projector-augmented wave (PAW) method and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for the exchange-correlation energy functional, as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) were used. The GGA calculation was performed with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation potential. A plane-wave cutoff energy of 400 eV was used. All atoms were fully relaxed with a tolerance in total energy of 0.1 mV, and the forces on each atom were less than 0.01 eV/Å. All calculations were spin-polarized.</p>
