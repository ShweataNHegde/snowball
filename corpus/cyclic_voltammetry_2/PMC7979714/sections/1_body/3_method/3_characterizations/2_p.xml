<p id="Par22">The Fe K-edge theoretical XANES calculations were carried out with the FDMNES code in the framework of real-space full multiple-scattering (FMS) scheme using Muffin-tin approximation for the potential. The energy-dependent exchange-correlation potential was calculated in the real Hedin–Lundqvist scheme, and then the spectra convoluted using a Lorentzian function with an energy-dependent width to account for the broadening due both to the core–hole width and to the final state width.</p>
