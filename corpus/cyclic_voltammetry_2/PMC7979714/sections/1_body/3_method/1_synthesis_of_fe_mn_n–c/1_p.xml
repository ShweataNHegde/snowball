<p id="Par19">Fe,Mn/N–C was synthesized via a soft-template pyrolysis method. Typically, 5 g dicyandiamide, 2 mL of phytic acid, 5 mg Iron phthalocyanine, and 5 µL 50% Manganese nitrate water solution were dissolved in 40 mL of water under stirring and dried in an oven at 80 °C for 24 h. The obtained solid powder was placed in a tubular carbonization furnace and carbonized at 900 °C for 6 h under Ar gas conditions at a heating rate of 10 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup>. The obtained sampled is named Fe,Mn/N–C.
