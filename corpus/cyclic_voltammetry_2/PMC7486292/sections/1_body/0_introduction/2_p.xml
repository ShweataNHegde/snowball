<p id="Par3">Despite the aforementioned advantages, however, silicon exhibits huge (ca. 400%) volumetric expansion/shrinking during repeated charge/discharge processes, which causes Si-based LIBs (cells) to have generally poor cycle lives. These changes in volume not only tend to pulverize silicon particles, and lead to the repeated loss and formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, but also cause detachment from the current collector and structural collapse between electrodes. Since these issues are associated with the loss of active material (Si), low Coulombic efficiency, and loss of contact for ionic and electrical conduction, they ultimately result in the rapid decay of cell capacity. As such, few Si-based electrodes are currently comprised entirely of Si, but are usually combinations of graphite and small amounts of Si
