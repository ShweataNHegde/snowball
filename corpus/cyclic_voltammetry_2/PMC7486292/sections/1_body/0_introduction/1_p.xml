<p id="Par2">High-capacity battery materials are in high demand for use in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Energy Storage Systems (ESS), which have high energy density requirements. For such applications, silicon (4,200 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, Li
 <sub>4.4</sub>Si), which has a significantly higher theoretical capacity than commercialized graphite (372 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, LiC
 <sub>6</sub>), is recognized to be a promising anode material. In addition to its high capacity, silicon is an effective material for anodes because of its low discharge voltage, and is suited for batteries with high energy density. Silicon is also highly cost-effective being one of the most abundant elements on earth
