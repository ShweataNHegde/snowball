<p id="Par4">To address problems arising from the large volumetric expansion of Si, various approaches to develop nano-structured Si have been proposed. However, in practice, they have proven expensive to implement. More importantly, the accumulation of irreversible damage to the Si electrodes during repeated charge/discharge cycles has made it particularly difficult to improve Si-based cell performance
