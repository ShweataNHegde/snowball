 </sup>. These studies have demonstrated the ability of self-healing polymers to form reversible noncovalent supramolecular polymer networks in Si electrodes, effectively mitigating the physical stresses caused by Si volume changes and hence improving the electrochemical performance of the corresponding electrodes. However, the polymer binders used in these reports have factors that limit their practical application, either because a toxic organic solvent is required to fabricate the electrodes due to the poor solubility of the binder
