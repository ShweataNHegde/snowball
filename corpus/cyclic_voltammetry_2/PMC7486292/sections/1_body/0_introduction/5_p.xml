<p id="Par6">Other attempts have been made to form silicon electrodes with 3D networks using functional polymers such as grafted polymers and crosslinked polymers, to enhance their physical properties. Electrodes fabricated from these polymer binders are more effective than the above-mentioned linear type polymer binders. Another approach involves the use of either ionically or electrically conducting polymers to provide ion/electron pathways in the electrodes, respectively

 </sup>. Although some progress has been made as a result of these efforts, none as yet have been able to repair the structural damage in the Si electrode caused by the large volume change of Si. This continues to be an obstacle to improving cell performance.
