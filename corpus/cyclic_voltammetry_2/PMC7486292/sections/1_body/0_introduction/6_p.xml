<p id="Par7">Against this backdrop, studies have recently been reported which use self-healable supramolecular polymers as binders for silicon anodes. Since these binders engage in reversible intermolecular interactions that enable self-healing, they can effectively accommodate the volumetric expansion of Si, maintaining an electrical contact with the active material, conductive agent and current collector, and thus contribute to capacity retention and cycling stability

 </sup>. In other words, noncovalent polymer networks, which are reversible, are expected to be better at accommodating volumetric expansion, compared to covalent polymer networks, which are irreversible
