<p id="Par11">By sequentially introducing functional groups with self-healing ability and ionic conductivity to the PAA main chain, the compositions of the functional groups were controlled, achieving optimal properties, while the water-soluble nature of the polymeric binders was maintained. We also investigated how such functional groups affected the physical properties of the binders, and the electrochemical properties of the corresponding Si-based cells.</p>
