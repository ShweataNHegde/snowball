<p id="Par5">An alternative approach to mitigate the problems of Si volumetric expansion is to use polymeric binders as an essential component in cell manufacturing. For example, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), alginate, poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) which all interact strongly with Si particles, have been used as polymeric binders to enhance cycle life by relieving the physical stress caused by the volumetric expansion of silicon electrodes. The development of water-soluble polymers is also advantageous because it means environmentally-friendly water can be used in the electrode manufacturing process. In contrast, PVdF and other conventional polymeric binders require toxic and volatile organic solvents for electrode manufacturing
