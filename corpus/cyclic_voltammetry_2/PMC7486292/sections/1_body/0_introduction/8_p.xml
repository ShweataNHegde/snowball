<p id="Par9">In this study, we developed a new multi-functional binder based on a self-healable polymer where ionic conductivity is further assigned, to be used for high-performance silicon electrodes with stable capacity retention even under high current density. To accomplish this, a Ureido-pyrimidinone (UPy) was partially introduced on poly(acrylic acid), PAA. UPy has fast self-healing through dynamic H-bonding within molecules, and interacts strongly with silicon particles and the oxidized surface (copper oxide) of the current collector. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), which can effectively transfer lithium ions by coordinating with lithium ions using their lone-pair electrons on the oxygen of the ether groups
