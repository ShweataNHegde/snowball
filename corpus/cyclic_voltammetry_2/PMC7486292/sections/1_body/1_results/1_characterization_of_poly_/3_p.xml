 <italic>g</italic>-PEG copolymer 
 <bold>2</bold>, prepared as a control, was also analyzed by 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectroscopic analysis, and the ratio of acrylic acid to PEG-MEMA was calculated from the integral ratio of proton peaks of carboxylic acid (H
 <sup>1</sup>) and PEG (H
 <sup>1</sup>) to be 70:1.6 (that is, y:z), the same as the ratio of acrylic acid to PEG-MEMA in PAU-
