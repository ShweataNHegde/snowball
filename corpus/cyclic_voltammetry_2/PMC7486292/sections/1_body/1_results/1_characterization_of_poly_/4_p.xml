<p id="Par15">The FT-IR spectra of PAU-g-PEG 
 <bold>1</bold> and PAA-g-PEG 
 <bold>2</bold> were further analyzed. The peak at 1758 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C=O stretching) in the ester group was observed, together with the broad peak at 2,500–3,500 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (O–H stretching) and peak at 1705 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C=O stretching) originated from the carboxylic acid group of PAA, confirming the successful grafting of both UPy and PEG unit onto PAA (Figure S3).
