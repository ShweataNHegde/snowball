<p id="Par13">The peak observed for copolymer 
 <bold>1</bold> near 12.2 ppm was for carboxylic acid (–COOH
 <sup>1</sup>), which indicated that the tBA groups had undergone hydrolysis successfully. The three peaks at 7.45, 7.04, and 5.72 ppm were due to the protons of the UPy molecules (namely, H
 <sup>2</sup>, H
 <sup>3</sup>, H
 <sup>4</sup>), and this showed that the monomer including UPy was successfully copolymerized for copolymer 
 <bold>1</bold>

 </sup>. The peaks near 3.48 ppm were for the protons in the PEG copolymers (H
 <sup>5</sup>), demonstrating that PEG had been grafted onto the polymers. Lastly, the peaks around 1–3 ppm were for the protons of the alkyl chains (H
 <sup>6</sup>, H
 <sup>7</sup>, H
 <sup>8</sup>) in the copolymer backbone. The ratio of UPyA:acrylic acid:PEG-MEMA in the PAU-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG copolymer 
 <bold>1</bold>, that is x:y:z, was calculated to be 1:70:1.6 based on the comparative integral ratio of the proton peaks (H
 <sup>1</sup>:H
 <sup>2,3,4</sup>:H
 <sup>5</sup>). This ratio was slightly different from the feed ratio used in the reactions, suggesting different reactivity between the comonomers (Table
