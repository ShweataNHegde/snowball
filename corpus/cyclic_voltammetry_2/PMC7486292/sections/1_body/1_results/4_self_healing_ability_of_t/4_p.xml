<p id="Par24">The prepared PAU-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG hydrogel was first cut into two pieces, one of which was dyed red to help illustrate the self-healing process. The pieces were stored at room temperature in contact with each other and without any special treatment. About 3 h later, it can be seen that the red dye gradually diffused from the surface of the cut hydrogel, and after about 24 h, the dye was completely spread and there was almost no trace of slicing activity. Overall, the self-healed hydrogel maintained the surface contact in a stable manner (Fig.
