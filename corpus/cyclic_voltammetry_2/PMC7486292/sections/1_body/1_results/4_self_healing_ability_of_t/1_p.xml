<p id="Par21">Next, we assessed the self-healing ability of copolymer PAU-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG 
 <bold>1</bold>, which had been found to significantly enhance the adhesive force of the electrodes through strong hydrogen bonds (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). To this end, the synthesized copolymer 
 <bold>1</bold> was firstly hydrogelated using the freeze/thaw method as follows. A 35 wt% PAU-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG solution was prepared and hydrogelated by freezing for 1 h at − 20 °C and thawing for 24 h at room temperature (Figure S5a)
