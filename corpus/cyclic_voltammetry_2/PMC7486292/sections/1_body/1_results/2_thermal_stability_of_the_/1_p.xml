<p id="Par16">The thermal decomposition behaviors of the synthesized copolymers 
 <bold>1</bold>, 
 <bold>2</bold> and PAA were confirmed using the TGA analysis (Figure S4). All three exhibited similar decomposition behavior because they had the same PAA unit as the main chain. The first degradation of PAU-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG, PAA-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG and PAA was at 180–322 °C (weight loss of 22 wt%), 179–322 °C (weight loss of 21 wt%) and 184–280 °C (weight loss of 9 wt%). This weight loss corresponded to dehydration, forming PAA anhydrides. In case of PAU-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG and PAA-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG, decomposition of both UPy and PEG units grafted onto the polymer side chain additionally occurred, causing a higher weight loss
