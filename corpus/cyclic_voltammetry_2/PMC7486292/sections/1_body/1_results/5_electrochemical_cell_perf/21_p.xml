<p id="Par46">Next, EIS measurements were taken for the three electrodes during the 5th and 50th charge/discharge process under a current density of 0.5 C after three formation cycles at 0.1 C. The first semi-circle represents the resistance (R
 <sub>SEI</sub>) due to the SEI layer, and the second semi-circle represents the resistance (R
 <sub>CT</sub>) due to charge transfer (Fig.
