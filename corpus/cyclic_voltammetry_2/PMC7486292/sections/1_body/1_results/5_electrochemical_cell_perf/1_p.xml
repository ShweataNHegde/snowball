<p id="Par26">Silicon electrodes were fabricated using PAU-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG and PAA-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG copolymers as well as PAA as binders, and their electrochemical performance was assessed using both a coin cell and 3-electrode cell (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The coin cell, in the form of a half cell, was comprised of a silicon electrode as the working electrode, and a lithium metal disk as the counter and reference electrode. For the 3-electrode cell, a piece of lithium metal was used as the reference electrode.
