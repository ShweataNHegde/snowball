<p id="Par49">The Si@PAU-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG electrode, which had both ionic conductivity and self-healing ability, was found to have much lower R
 <sub>SEI</sub> and R
 <sub>CT</sub> values, and maintained an impedance similar to the 5 cycles level, even after 50 cycles (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>d). This can be attributed to the formation of a strong electrical network between active materials due to the excellent in-electrode mechanical stability of the PAU-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG binder, and low resistance due to the formation of ion transport channels by PEG. In particular, these results are attributed to the effective accommodation of physical stress produced by the volume expansion of Si, by introducing the self-healable Upy unit into the polymer binder.
