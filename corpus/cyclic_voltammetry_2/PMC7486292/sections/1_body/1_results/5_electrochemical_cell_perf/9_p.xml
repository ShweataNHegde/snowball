<p id="Par34">To determine differences in the electrolyte uptake of the silicon electrodes in relation to binder type, the three electrodes were stored in an electrolyte for 48Â h under the same conditions, and swelling ratios were measured based on the weight changes of each electrode. First of all, PAA showed the highest electrolyte uptake, due to the strong H-bonding of the carboxylic acid groups in PAA with the carbonate-based electrolyte [ethylene carbonate (EC) and ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC)]. The PAA-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG electrode, on the other hand, showed the lowest electrolyte uptake, due to its weakest H-bonding, caused by the grafting of PEG onto PAA. The PAU-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG electrode, whose reduced hydrogen bonding interactions by PEG-grafting were compensated by UPy molecules, showed a higher electrolyte uptake (Figure S6).
