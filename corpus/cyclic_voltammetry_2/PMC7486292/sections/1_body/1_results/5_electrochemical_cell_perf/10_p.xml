<p id="Par35">It was, therefore concluded that the Si@PAA-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG electrode had a relatively low lithiation capacity because of the low electrolyte uptake of this binder (PAA-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG), which limits the activation of the active material in its initial cycle. The Si@PAU-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG electrode, with its high electrolyte update, had a high lithiation capacity (Fig.Â
