<p id="Par47">The results showed that both electrodes fabricated from the PAA-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG and PAA binders showed an increase in R
 <sub>SEI</sub> after cycles, but the size of the semi-circle was larger for the Si@PAA-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG electrode, which also had a higher R
 <sub>SEI</sub> after both 5 cycles and 50 cycles than the Si@PAA (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>e,f). This means that the silicon electrode with the PAA-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG binder, which had the weakest physical stability, formed a thick SEI layer, as it was unable to tolerate the stress caused by volumetric expansion during the charge/discharge process.
