<p id="Par31">The capacity and capacity retention of the three silicon electrodes at 350 cycles were 1,450.2 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, 53.3%; 356.6 mAh g

 <sup>−1</sup>, 8.8% respectively, or PAU-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG &gt; PAA &gt; PAA-g-PEG when arranged in increasing order. These results are consistent with the physical stability of the electrodes. The hydrogen bonding ability of PAA, together with the self-healing property of UPy, in the PAU-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG electrode is believed to have effectively alleviated the structural deterioration caused by volumetric changes in the silicon during the charge/discharge process.
