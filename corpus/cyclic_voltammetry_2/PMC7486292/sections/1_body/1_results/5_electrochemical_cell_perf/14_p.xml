<p id="Par39">The Si@PAA-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG electrode also showed good rate capability and recovery (although not better than the PAU-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG electrode) under all C-rate conditions. From these results, we can conclude that grafting PEG onto the PAA played a key role in enhancing ionic conductivity, and in turn, rate capability.
