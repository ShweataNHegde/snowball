<p id="Par43">The cycling performance of the Si@PAU-g-PEG electrode with low binder content (10 wt%) was also obtained at 0.5 C (Figure S7). The capacity and capacity retention of this electrode at 100 cycles were 1,333.3 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> and 63.3%, respectively, indicating that the PAU-g-PEG binder showed good performance even with a high active material and a low binder content.
