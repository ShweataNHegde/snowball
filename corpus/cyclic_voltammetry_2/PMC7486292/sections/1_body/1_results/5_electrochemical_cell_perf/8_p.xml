<p id="Par33">The initial Coulombic efficiency of the three binders was in the order of (PAA-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG: 74.2%), (PAU-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG: 70.4%) and (PAA: 51.6%). The two electrodes fabricated from PEG-grafted copolymers, PAA-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG and PAU-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG, showed good Coulombic efficiency, higher than 70% (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). The PAA-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG electrode had a slightly higher Coulombic efficiency than the PAU-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG electrode due to differences in the activation of the active material, that is Si, arising from differences in electrolyte uptake.
