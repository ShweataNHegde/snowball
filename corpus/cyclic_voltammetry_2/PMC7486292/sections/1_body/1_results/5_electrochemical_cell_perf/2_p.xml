<p id="Par27">To assess their long-term cycling performance during the charge/discharge process, three electrodes with a mass loading level in the range of 0.5–0.6 mg cm
 <sup>−2</sup> were charged/discharged at a low current density of 0.1 C and a voltage range of 0.01–1.5 V for the initial formation cycles (3 cycles), and at 0.5 C in the following cycles (Fig.
