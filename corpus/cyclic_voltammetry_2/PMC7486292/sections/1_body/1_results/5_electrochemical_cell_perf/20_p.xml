<p id="Par45">CV measurements were taken for all three electrodes under the same voltage range and scan rate conditions, and EIS measurements were obtained under the same charge/discharge conditions (0.5 C) and frequency range. The CV measurements showed that all three electrodes reached a cathodic peak at 0.21 V, corresponding to the lithiation of Si, and anodic peaks at 0.33 V and 0.50 V, corresponding to the delithiation process. All electrodes also experienced reversible electrochemical reactions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a–c). In addition, irreversible peaks were initially observed for all three electrodes in the range of 1.0–0.5 V due to the formation of an SEI layer in the cathodic scan domain of the first cycle, but such peaks were not seen in the second cycle. This means that side reactions did not occur in the charge/discharge voltage range, which verifies the electrochemical stability of the UPy-functionalized and PEG-grafted PAA, that is PAU-
