<p id="Par36">Afterwards, the Si@PAU-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG electrode reached a high Coulombic efficiency of 94.0% in just two cycles, higher than that of PAA-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG (92.6%) and PAA (81.1%). After the initial capacity fading, it quickly stabilized, and a Coulombic efficiency higher than 99% was maintained throughout. After 350 cycles, the Coulombic efficiency remained at a high of 99.4% (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). Overall, the Si@PAU-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG electrode showed outstanding initial activation of silicon, and achieved high reversible capacity by overcoming the physical stress caused by volumetric change, through the stabilized ion conductive pathway.
