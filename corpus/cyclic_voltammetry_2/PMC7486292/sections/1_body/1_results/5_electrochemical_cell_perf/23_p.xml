<p id="Par48">As for R
 <sub>CT</sub>, the Si@PAA-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG electrode revealed a lower resistance value than Si@PAA due to the enhanced lithium ion conductivity provided by the PEG domain. R
 <sub>CT</sub> is influenced by both electronic and ionic resistance, since charge transfer involves the transfer of both electrons and lithium ions, and the electrode made of the binder (PAA-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG), which had poor mechanical properties, lost electronic and ionic contact after cycling, leading to an increase in R
