<p id="Par50">Overall, the PAU-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG binder alleviated the increase in resistance, by continuously recovering the structural collapse of the Si electrode, and also by maintaining electrical contact between active materials. These results are consistent with the good electrochemical performance data exhibited by the Si@PAU-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG electrode.
