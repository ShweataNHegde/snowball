<p id="Par42">Although capacity decreased with increasing Si loading level, the initial capacity fading quickly stabilized for all three electrodes, and they subsequently showed good capacity retention. The electrodes fabricated with mass loadings of Si of 0.8 mg cm
 <sup>−2</sup> and 1.0 mg cm
 <sup>−2</sup> at 200 cycles maintained a capacity higher than 1,400 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> and 1,200 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> respectively. These results indicate that PAU-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG binders can be utilized in silicon electrodes even at high loading levels, and that such electrodes are suitable for batteries with high energy densities.
