<p id="Par29">The PAA-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG-based silicon electrode (Si@PAA-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG) showed a higher initial capacity (2,716.9 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>) than that of PAA, but also experienced severe initial capacity decay. The poorest capacity retention, with capacity dropping below that of even the PAA electrode after 200 cycles, was obtained for the Si@PAA-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG electrode.
