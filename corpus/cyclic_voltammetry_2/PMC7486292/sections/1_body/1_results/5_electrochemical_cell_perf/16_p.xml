<p id="Par41">The Si electrodes using the PAU-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG binder were also prepared with various mass loading conditions of the active material, and their capacity retention was compared, to further evaluate the electrochemical properties of the Si@PAU-g-PEG, which exhibited the best cycle and rate characteristics (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). This was performed at high loading levels of 0.8 mg cm
 <sup>−2</sup> and 1.0 mg cm
 <sup>−2</sup>, higher than the condition of 0.5 mg cm
 <sup>−2</sup> at which stable cycle performance was obtained. The evaluation was conducted at 0.5 C for all three cells.
