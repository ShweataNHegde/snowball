<p id="Par38">The C-rate performance test revealed that the two electrodes fabricated from PEG polymers (PAU-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG and PAA-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG) had high rate capabilities. In particular, the Si@PAU-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG electrode with the best cycling performance achieved a high capacity of 2,753, 2,590 and 2,519 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> even under a high current density of 1, 2 and 3 C, respectively. When the current density was dropped to 0.1 C again, it demonstrated excellent rate capability, with a recorded capacity of 2,800 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, which is close to its initial capacity of 2,900 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>.
