<p id="Par32">Moreover, both the PAU-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG and PAA-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG electrodes showed a higher initial capacity than the PAA electrode. This result is ascribed to the increase in ionic conductivity via the Li
 <sup>+</sup> conductive pathway formed by grafting PEG in these two binders (to be discussed later). The PAU-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG binder, in particular, was more physically stable than the other two binders, which was advantageous to the formation of the lithium ion pathway, and helped to achieve the highest initial capacity.
