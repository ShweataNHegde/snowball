<p id="Par18">The results showed that the adhesive force of the polymers was in the order of PAU-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG &gt; PAA &gt; PAA-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG. The PAA itself had relatively high adhesion due to its interactions with the hydroxyl (–OH) functional groups on the silicon surface and the oxidized surface of the current collector. The adhesive force of copolymer PAA-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG 
 <bold>2</bold>, prepared by grafting just PEG onto the PPA main chain, was slightly lower than PAA. This can be attributed to the weakened interactions among electrode components in the presence of PEG, which engages fewer hydrogen bonds compared to the PAA copolymer.
