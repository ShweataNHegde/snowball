<p id="Par17">An 180° peel-off test of the Si electrode made with the newly developed polymer binders was conducted to determine the physical stability, that is the adhesive force, of PAU-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG 
 <bold>1</bold>, which was designed to have both self-healing ability and ionic conductivity. The results were compared to that of pristine poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) with a molecular weight (
 <italic>M</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>w</italic>
 </sub> = 100,000 g mol
 <sup>−1</sup>) similar to that of copolymers 
 <bold>1</bold>, and also with PAA-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG 
 <bold>2</bold>, which has Li
 <sup>+</sup>-conductivity but no self-healing sites (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). All three electrodes had the same weight ratio (SiNP:Super P:binder = 6:2:2) and controlled thickness.
