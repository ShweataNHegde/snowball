<p id="Par20">Ultimately, the PAU-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG copolymer resolved the problem of weakened adhesive force caused by PEG grafting, by introducing UPy molecules, and it achieved higher physical stability than PAA. This enhanced the physical properties of the PAU-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG copolymer binder, and was expected to accommodate the volume expansion of Si more effectively (as will be discussed later).
