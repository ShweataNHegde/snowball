<p id="Par19">The PAU-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG copolymer which was comprised of both PEG grafted onto the PAA main chain and the self-healing UPy molecules showed a high adhesive force of 1.6 N, significantly higher than that of PAA polymers, even with the grafting of PEG (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). The interactions between the electrode components were reinforced by the introduction of UPy, through strong H-bonding, and the UPy molecules further contributed to the enhanced physical properties of the polymers by serving as physical crosslinking sites between the polymer chains and also with Si particles, to form a more stable 3D network, as reported before
