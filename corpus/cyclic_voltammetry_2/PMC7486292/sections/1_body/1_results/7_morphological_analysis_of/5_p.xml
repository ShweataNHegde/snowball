<p id="Par59">The above SEM results indicate the advantages of the PAU-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG binder, which was capable of self-healing and had high physical stability due to the formation of a stable 3D network through physical crosslinking. These morphological properties were consistent with the results of the cyclability test and EIS, in which Si@PAU-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG had the most outstanding capacity retention and lowest resistance.
