<p id="Par58">Furthermore, thickness changes after formation cycles were analyzed through cross-sectional SEM images (Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S11</xref>). The thickness increase of Si@PAU-g-PEG, Si@PAA-g-PEG and Si@PAA electrodes was 8.57%, 19.0% and 31.4% respectively, when compared to thickness of the pristine electrodes. It can be seen that PAU-g-PEG binder showed the lowest thickness increase and maintained the good contact with the current collector, indicating excellent structural stability of electrode.
