<p id="Par55">Morphological changes in the silicon electrodes after cycling were observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) analyses (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). The silicon electrodes fabricated from the three types of binders (PAU-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG, PAA-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG and PAA) all showed uniform morphologies before cycling, demonstrating the binders were well dispersed, due to interactions between the PAA main chain and silicon particles (Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S10</xref>). After 50 cycles, however, very different morphologies were observed in the three electrodes.
