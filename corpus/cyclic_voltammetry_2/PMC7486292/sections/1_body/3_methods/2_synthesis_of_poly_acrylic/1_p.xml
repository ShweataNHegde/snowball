 <italic>tert</italic>-Butyl acrylate (6.26 g, 48.8 mmol), Upy-containing monomer (UPy) (0.1 g, 244 μmol) and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (0.61 g, 1.22 mmol), together with AIBN (32 mg, 195 μmol), were dissolved in DMF (15 mL). The solution was sealed in a Schlenk flask and heated at 70 °C for 3 h under N
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere and the reaction was terminated by freezing the flask using liquid nitrogen. The solution was then precipitated in water and the filtrate was washed with distilled water several times. The solid was collected, and dissolved in trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and left to stir for 3 h to give a white solid. The obtained solid was washed with hexane and acetone several times before it was dried under vacuum to give the product as a white powder (3.80 g, 89.2%);
