<p id="Par66">The electrodes having a composition of the silicon nanoparticle (50 nm):Super P:binder = 6:2:2 and 7:2:1 weight ratio were prepared as follows: At first, the polymer binders were dissolved in distilled water by simply mechanical mixing. Silicon nanoparticles and Super P were mixed in dry condition and then each polymer binder solution was added into it to form a homogeneous slurry. The slurry with controlled viscosity was coated onto Cu foil using a doctor blade and dried in an oven at 80 °C for 30 min. As-formed electrodes were compressed to improve packing density by using roll-press machine. After cutting the electrodes with a size suitable to make the electrochemical evaluating cell, drying was conducted under vacuum at 120 °C for 3 h to remove the remaining water completely. Finally, the electrodes with the target specific mass loading values (0.5–1.0 Si mg cm
 <sup>−2</sup>) were prepared for further electrochemical studies.
