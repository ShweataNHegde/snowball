<p id="Par73">To evaluate the electrochemical properties of the silicon electrodes, 2032-type coin cells and 3-electrode cells were assembled in an Ar-filled glovebox, using porous polyethylene (Celgard 2400) as a separator, lithium metal disc as a counter electrode, and 1 M LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> in ethylene carbonate and ethyl methyl carbonate (1:2 v/v) with 10% fluoroethylene carbonate as electrolytes. In addition, a piece of lithium metal was used as a reference electrode in case of 3-electrode cell. In order to measure the cyclability, a galvanostatic discharge–charge cycling was conducted in the voltage range of 0.01–1.5 V vs Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup> using CPS-Lab battery cycler (Basytec) at 25 °C in a temperature-controlled chamber. An electrochemical potentiostat system (VSP, Bio-Logic) was used to take electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) measurements. EIS was acquired over a frequency range of 10 MHz to 100 kHz with AC amplitude of 10 mV, and CV was performed by scanning voltage at a rate of 0.1 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup>. The GITT tests were carried out at low current of 0.05 C applied for 15 min for each Coulometric titration step. After each charging step, the cell potential was stabilized to OCV for 30 min.
