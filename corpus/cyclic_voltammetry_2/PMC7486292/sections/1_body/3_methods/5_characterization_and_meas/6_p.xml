<p id="Par72">The thermal stabilities of the polymer binders were analyzed by Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). All polymer binders were fully dried under vacuum at 80 °C overnight before measurements, and TGA was performed on a Scinco TGA-N 1500 instrument over range of 30–800 °C in a nitrogen flow at a scanning rate of 20 °C min
