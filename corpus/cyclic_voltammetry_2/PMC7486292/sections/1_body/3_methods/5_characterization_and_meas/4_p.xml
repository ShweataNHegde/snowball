<p id="Par70">To measure the adhesion force of the polymeric binder for silicon electrode, a 180° peel-off test was performed using Universal Testing Machine (Shimadzu, EZ-L). The fabricated electrodes having same thickness were cut to a rectangular shape and were attached to the electrodes using the 3 M tape (12 mm width). By pulling the tape at a constant displacement rate of 30 mm min
 <sup>−1</sup>, the applied force was measured as an adhesion force.
