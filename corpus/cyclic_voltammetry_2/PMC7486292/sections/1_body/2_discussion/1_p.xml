<p id="Par60">In conclusion, this study employed simple radical copolymerization to develop a water-soluble copolymer PAU-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG with self-healing ability and ionic conductivity, and used it as a polymeric binder for new silicon anodes. PEG was grafted onto the proposed PAU-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG polymeric binder to achieve lithium ion conductivity, and this was verified through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). A hydrogelation test demonstrated that the UPy molecules engaged in dynamic hydrogen bonds, inducing self-healing. The results of the Warburg impedance test revealed that the Si@PAU-
 <italic>g</italic>-PEG electrode, with UPy unit as a crosslinking site, formed a stable 3D network within the silicon electrode, and maintained stable lithium ion pathways even after cycling.
