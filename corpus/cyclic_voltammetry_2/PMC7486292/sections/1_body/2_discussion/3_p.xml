<p id="Par62">Based on the above, this study proved that the newly developed UPy-functionalized-PEG-grafted PAA, PAU-g-PEG, binder designed to have mechanical stability, self-healing ability and ionic conductivity was able to improve the electrochemical performance of silicon anodes, which previously experienced various issues due to severe volumetric change during charge/discharge cycles. These findings present new possibilities for multi-functional polymeric binders in lithium ion batteries with high energy densities.</p>
