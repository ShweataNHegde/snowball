 <p>Nanostructured metal oxides (MOs) demonstrate good electrochemical properties and are regarded as promising anode materials for high-performance lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The capacity of nickel-cobalt oxides-based materials is among the highest for binary transition metals oxide (TMOs). In the present paper, we report the investigation of Ni-Co-O (NCO) thin films obtained by atomic layer deposition (ALD) using nickel and cobalt metallocenes in a combination with oxygen plasma. The formation of NCO films with different ratios of Ni and Co was provided by ALD cycles leading to the formation of nickel oxide (a) and cobalt oxide (b) in one supercycle (linear combination of a and b cycles). The film thickness was set by the number of supercycles. The synthesized films had a uniform chemical composition over the depth with an admixture of metallic nickel and carbon up to 4 at.%. All samples were characterized by a single NixCo1-xO phase with a cubic face-centered lattice and a uniform density. The surface of the NCO films was uniform, with rare inclusions of nanoparticles 15–30 nm in diameter. The growth rates of all films on steel were higher than those on silicon substrates, and this difference increased with increasing cobalt concentration in the films. In this paper, we propose a method for processing cyclic voltammetry curves for revealing the influence of individual components (nickel oxide, cobalt oxide and solid electrolyte interface—SEI) on the electrochemical capacity. The initial capacity of NCO films was augmented with an increase of nickel oxide content.</p>
