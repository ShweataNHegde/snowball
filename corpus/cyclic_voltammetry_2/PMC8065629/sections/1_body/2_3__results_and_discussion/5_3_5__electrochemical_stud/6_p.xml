<p>Cyclic charge/discharge of electrodes resulted in a gradual increase in the discharge capacity. Wei et al. [
 <xref rid="B72-nanomaterials-11-00907" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] (Figure 7c, AT curve) also observed capacity growth during cycling of active material with a similar chemical composition (NiO-CoO/carbon fiber). However, a detailed study of this phenomenon has not been found. The increase in capacity during cycling is likely directly related to the growth of SEI films and may depend on the nature of the anode material and the electrolyte used. Consequently, in the study of thin filmsâ€™ electrochemical properties, the contribution from SEI cannot be neglected, in contrast to the study of bulk anode/cathode materials. Considering the results of our previous studies on NiO films [
