<p>After conducting 200 charge/discharge cycles, it can be seen that the area characterizing nickel oxide activity decreased slightly for all coating compositions. A more noticeable decrease in electrochemical activity was observed for cobalt oxide. The area under the curve characterizing the SEI film increased significantly for all considered coating compositions. The SEI filmâ€™s capacity became comparable to the capacity of TMOs (

For electrodes with the NCO-1/1 composition, a significant increase in capacity due to the SEI was also observed, presumably due to the different morphology of the films and the presence of whisker nanocrystals (

Samples of the NCO-3/1 and NCO-5/1 series were characterized by the lowest SEI contribution to the total capacity.
