<p>At the beginning of the CV study, the open circuit voltage was close to 3 V. As the electrode potential gradually decreased, the conversion reaction was more likely to occur [

A similar rise in current was observed when carbon materials were studied using electrolyte, signifying the reduction of the electrolyte components. With a subsequent increase in potential from 0 to 3 V in the anodic region, current peaks of 1.6–1.7 V and 2.0–2.3 V were observed, characterizing the changes of SEI film and transition metal oxides (NiO and CoO), respectively (
