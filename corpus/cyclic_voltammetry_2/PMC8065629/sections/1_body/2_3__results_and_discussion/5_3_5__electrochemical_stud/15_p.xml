<p>After subtraction of SEI film capacity from the total, the following values of deposited transition metal oxide films were obtained: NiO—538 µAh/cm
 <sup>2</sup>/µm; NCO-5/1—581 µAh/cm
 <sup>2</sup>/µm; NCO-3/1—729 µAh/cm
 <sup>2</sup>/µm; NCO-1/1—539 µAh/cm
 <sup>2</sup>/µm; CoO—568 µAh/cm
 <sup>2</sup>/µm. The calculated values of TMO films at the initial cycles approached the theoretical values (
