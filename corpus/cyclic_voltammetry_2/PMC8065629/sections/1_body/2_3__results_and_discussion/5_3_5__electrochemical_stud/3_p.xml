<p>As the discharge current increased from 0.3C to 33C, the charge capacities decreased from 909–967 µAh/cm
 <sup>2</sup>/µm (1441–1460 mAh/g) to 625–706 µAh/cm
 <sup>2</sup>/µm (990–1140 mAh/g). Such a moderate decrease in capacity (21–33%), with a significant increment of current density, was apparently due to the small thickness of the electrochemically active films.
