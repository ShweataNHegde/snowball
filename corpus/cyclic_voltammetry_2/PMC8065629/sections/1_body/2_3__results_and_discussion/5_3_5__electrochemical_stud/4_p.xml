<p>The measured capacities of thin-film electrodes were higher than the theoretical values and those found in the literature. Greater values for measured capacities over theoretical values for samples with similar chemical composition were also observed previously [

The difference between measured and theoretical capacities was likely caused by the additional capacity of an organic polymer film formed on the surface of the active material as a result of reactions between Ni and Co metal and electrolyte at electrode potentials below 0.4 V [
