<p>The specific capacity in the initial charge/discharge cycles is mainly determined by the capacity of transition metal oxides (Ni, Co). The smallest SEI film formation was observed for the NCO-3/1 coating, where nearly 80% of the capacity was electrochemical processes involving nickel and cobalt oxides; for the other compositions, this figure was closer to 60% (
