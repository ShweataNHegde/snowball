<p>At fixed current densities above 160 μA/cm
 <sup>2</sup> (~5C), the charge capacities were augmented with additional nickel content in the deposited film. An exception to this trend was the NCO-1/1 sample, which exhibited the highest specific capacity (870–706 µAh/cm
 <sup>2</sup>/µm)) at current densities of 160–800 μA/cm
 <sup>2</sup>. The observed superior capacity of the NCO-1/1 sample was likely due to the formation of whiskers during depositions, which have higher surface areas (
