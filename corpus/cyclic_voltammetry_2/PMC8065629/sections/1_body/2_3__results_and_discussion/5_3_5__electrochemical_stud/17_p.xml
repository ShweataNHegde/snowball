 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00907-f007">Figure 7</xref>c shows the specific discharge capacities for the first cycles and after the cycle life test (200 cycles). Although the SEI film’s contribution increased, the overall capacity of CoO films decreased due to degradation of the TMO phase (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00907-f007">Figure 7</xref>a,b). The NCO-3/1 and NCO-5/1 samples showed nearly equal capacity values before and after the cycle life tests. The growth of SEI film capacity compensated the loss of capacity due to transition metal degradation. The augmentation of NCO-1/1 and NiO total capacity (by a factor of 1.5–1.8) was related to SEI film growth caused by increased surface area (
