<p>To determine the influence of the chemical composition of the electrodes on the electrochemical activity, the shape of the anodic CV curves was analyzed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00907-f006">Figure 6</xref>c,d). The curves were normalized to the film thickness to allow for comparative analysis. With an increment of nickel oxide in films, a gradual shift in the maximum current intensity of the anodic curve from 2.04 V (CoO) to 2.23 V (NiO) and a change in the position of the maximum characterizing the SEI film from 1.6 to 1.7 V (

The shift towards high potentials of the maxima characterizing the electrochemical activity of the SEI film and nickel and cobalt oxides, with an increase in the proportion of nickel oxide, persisted even after 200 charge/discharge cycles (

After 200 charge/discharge cycles, the intensity of the maximum characterizing the SEI filmâ€™s electrochemical activity increased and became more significant than the total intensity of the maxima of nickel and cobalt oxides (
