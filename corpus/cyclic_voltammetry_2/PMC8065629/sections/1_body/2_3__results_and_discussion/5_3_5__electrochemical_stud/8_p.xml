<p>To understand the origin of current increment at 1.6–1.7 V of the anode curve, the effect of the potential width range on the form of the CV curve was studied using NCO-5/1 samples. For the first cycle, when the potential range was narrowed to 3.0–0.8 V, the current increase of 1.6–1.7 V potential range of the cathode curve did not appear (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-11-00907">Figure S6</xref>). Thus, the augmentation of current in the 0.8–0.1 V region (cathode curve) and in 1.6–1.7 V (anode curve) is connected and may be due to SEI film formation, which can significantly contribute to the reversible capacity. The transferred charge in 0.8–3.0 V and 0.1–3.0 V was 0.0709 C (conversion reaction at 0.8–3.0 V) and 0.321 C (conversion reaction in 0.01–3.0 V range and SEI formation 0.01–0.8 V). When cycling from 0.01 V to 3.0 V (first to ninth cycle), the cathode peak observed at 0.43 V (first cycle) shifted towards higher potentials up to 1.0 V, signifying the transformation of the SEI film.
