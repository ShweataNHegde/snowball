<p>According to XRR data (
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-11-00907-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) obtained by the simplex method, all samples consisted of a uniform density layer with a roughness of 0.63 to 3.23 nm. As the number of NiCp
 <sub>2</sub> pulses in the supercycle decreased, the film density also decreased from 6.60 to 6.31 g/cm
 <sup>3</sup> (except for the NCO-1/1 sample), which was caused by a relative increase in the amount of the less dense CoO phase (6.72 g/cm
 <sup>3</sup> for NiO and 6.44 g/cm
 <sup>3</sup> for CoO). The low density of thin films in comparison with compact oxides NiO and CoO was associated with a large influence of surface effects [
