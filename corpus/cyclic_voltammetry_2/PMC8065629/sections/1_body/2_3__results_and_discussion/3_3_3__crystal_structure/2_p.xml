<p>It can be seen from the results of X-ray diffraction analysis that with an increase in the Ni content in the Ni
 <sub>x</sub>Co
 <sub>1−x</sub>O phase, the unit cell parameter decreased from 4.244 to 4.161 Å, which was reflected in a smooth shift of the positions of the peaks (111), (200), and (220) (in the XRD patterns, the dashed lines show CoO peak positions). The unit cell parameter of NiO and CoO films closely agreed with the data for compact materials NiO (4.16 Å) and CoO (4.24 Å). As expected it increased with an increase in the proportion of CoO compared to NiO. From the ratio of the intensities of the peaks, a texture in the (111) direction was observed in the samples, which is typical for structures with a cubic system. The absence of reflections of metallic nickel, the presence of which was determined using XPS, may indicate its low fraction in the volume of the film or X-ray amorphousness due to the small size of crystallites.
