 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00907-f002">Figure 2</xref> shows the diffraction patterns of the samples obtained by the grazing-incidence method. The broad diffraction peaks in the region of 37°, 43°, and 63° were characterized by a cubic structure with the space group Fm-3m. Narrow peaks at 33° and in the range of 54–62° were associated with defects in the crystal structure of silicon substrates. The absence of peaks at 31° and 56° indicated a gradual substitution of cobalt atoms for nickel atoms without the formation of intermediate oxide forms of spinel (Ni
