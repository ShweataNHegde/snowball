<p>Plan view and cross-section images of the studied films on stainless a steel substrate are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00907-f004">Figure 4</xref>. The general features of the film morphologies of silicon and steel were similar. As in the case of films on silicon, the growth rate increased with the cobalt content, though it should be noted that the thickness of the films on steel with simultaneous deposition process was greater, which indicates an increased growth rate of films on a steel substrate (see 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-11-00907-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-11-00907-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> also presents the typical sizes of surface inclusions observed in NCO films on silicon (spectral ellipsometry results) and steel (SEM results).
