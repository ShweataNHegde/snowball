<p>Scanning electron microscopy images of NiO, NCO-5/1, NCO-3/1, NCO-1/1, and CoO films on Si substrate are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00907-f003">Figure 3</xref>. For the monoxide films (NiO and CoO), the surfaces were homogeneous and free of inclusions. Bright inclusions with a diameter of 10–13 nm (NCO-5/1, NCO-3/1) and 25–30 nm (NCO-1/1) were visible on the NCO film samples, as roughness increased in the series NCO-5/1—NCO-3/1—NCO-1/1, which is consistent with the XRR results (
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-11-00907-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). It should be noted that the bright features of the NCO-1/1 sample were randomly directed nanowire crystals on the surface, the growth features of which will be discussed below.
