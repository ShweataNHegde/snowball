<p>It should be noted that, as in the case of NCO-1/1 on silicon, the film on steel was covered with randomly directed nanowire crystals, but their number was noticeably higher, which is most likely associated with a large number of crystallization centers and inhomogeneities on the steel substrate (due to the increased roughness) rather than silicon. On the cross-section view of the NCO-1/1 sample (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00907-f004">Figure 4</xref>d bottom), nanowire crystals can be easily observed, reaching lengths up to 40 nm. Several mechanisms of the nanowire/whiskers growth are presented in the literature, describing the morphology of the sample NCO-1/1 [

 <xref rid="B70-nanomaterials-11-00907" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Most likely, in the case of sample NCO-1/1, these two conditions were fulfilled, stimulating the growth of nanowire crystals on the surface. A more detailed discussion is presented in the
