<p>The XPS results show that NCO films contained metallic nickel and, possibly, metallic cobalt as a result of the decomposition of precursors NiCp
 <sub>2</sub> and CoCp
 <sub>2</sub> [
 <xref rid="B62-nanomaterials-11-00907" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. It can be assumed that bright inclusions comparable with the film thickness were metallic particles of nickel and cobalt, a higher density of which gives an increased yield of secondary electrons that increases their contrast in comparison with the film.
