<p>XPS and SEM-EDX were used to determine the chemical composition of the samples. Measurements of XPS spectra were made after sputtering of the surface layer using the argon ions (3 keV). To determine homogeneity of a chemical composition, different sputtering times were used (0, 30 and 45 or 90 s). Results of XPS without sputtering showed high carbon content (&gt;20%) due to adventation carbon contamination. After sputtering, the carbon content decreased remarkably to 2â€“4% depending on the type of sample (
