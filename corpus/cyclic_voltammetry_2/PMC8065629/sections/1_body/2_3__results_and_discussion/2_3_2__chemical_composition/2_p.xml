<p>In the C1s spectra (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00907-f001">Figure 1</xref>a), for all samples and regardless of the sputtering time, only one peak (maxima at 284.8 eV) was clearly visible, corresponding to the carbon of the C-C and C-H. The carbon was likely from cyclopentadienyl nickel and cobalt, which can thermally decompose at the temperatures required for ALD [
 <xref rid="B59-nanomaterials-11-00907" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In general, the peak with a maximum at 284.8 eV was symmetric. No additional peaks in the range of 287â€“292 eV, corresponding to carbon found in various oxygen-containing groups (hydroxyl, aldehyde, carboxyl etc.) were observed.
