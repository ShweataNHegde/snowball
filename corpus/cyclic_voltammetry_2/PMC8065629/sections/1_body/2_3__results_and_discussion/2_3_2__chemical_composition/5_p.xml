<p>The oxygen content in the films varied between 41–47% and was slightly less than the total content of cobalt and nickel due to the presence of metallic nickel and possibly cobalt. The shape of the O1s spectra was similar for all samples (

 <xref rid="B64-nanomaterials-11-00907" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. However, a shift of the peaks towards lower energies was observed with decreasing nickel concentration, although the shift was small and the maxima of all peaks were in the range of 529.4–529.7 eV. Such small displacements can be caused by inaccuracies in charge compensation during the normalization of the spectra to the C1s line, which was very noisy for these samples (
