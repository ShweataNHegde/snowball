<p>The spectrum for Ni2p (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00907-f001">Figure 1</xref>b) was complex because of the significant overlap of the Ni3d and O2p orbitals, resulting in broad peaks with multiple satellite peaks [

 <xref rid="B60-nanomaterials-11-00907" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,
 <xref rid="B61-nanomaterials-11-00907" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. However, the shape and position of the maxima showed that all the samples under study contain NiO (854.1 eV) and Ni
 <sup>+3</sup> (Ni
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> and/or Ni
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>), or nickel hydroxideâ€”Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>. For all samples, a peak in the region with a maximum of 852.7 eV, corresponding to metallic nickel, was clearly visible. The formation of metallic nickel is caused by the decomposition of the initial precursor, a cyclopentadienyl nickel. This was observed in a number of other studies, including CVD using Ni(C

 <sub>2</sub> and O
 <sub>2</sub> as precursors [
