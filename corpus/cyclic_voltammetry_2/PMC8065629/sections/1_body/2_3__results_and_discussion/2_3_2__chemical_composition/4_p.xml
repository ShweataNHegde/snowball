<p>The Co2p spectrum was also quite complex (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00907-f001">Figure 1</xref>c), as it contained a combination of many components, and could not be decomposed into components with high accuracy and reliability. However, according to the position of the Co2p maxima both in the NCO series and in the CO sample, cobalt existed predominantly in the form of CoO. However, the presence of metallic cobalt and/or Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> in small amounts was also possible.
