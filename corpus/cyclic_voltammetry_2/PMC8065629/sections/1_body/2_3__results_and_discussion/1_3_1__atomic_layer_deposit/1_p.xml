<p>First, we determined the conditions for ALD of oxide systems (NiO, CoO) based on previous experience [

 <xref rid="B57-nanomaterials-11-00907" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], as shown in 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-11-00907-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The optimal temperature of the reactor was 300 °C, and for stainless-steel bottles with NiCp
 <sub>2</sub> and CoCp
 <sub>2,</sub> the optimal temperatures were 110 and 150 °C, respectively. The pulse times of the metal-containing reagent(A) and oxygen plasma(B) were 1 and 15 s, respectively, for both processes.
