<p>The thicknesses of the films on silicon substrates were measured using spectroscopic ellipsometry and XRR. The XRR curves are represented in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-11-00907">supplement materials (Figures S1–S5)</xref>. The growth per cycle (GPC) and per supercycle (GPSC) are presented in 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-11-00907-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The XRR data showed slightly lower values than ellipsometry data. Based on the GPC values obtained from ellipsometry for pure NiO and CoO, the thicknesses, GPC, and GPSC were calculated for the binary TMO samples (
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-11-00907-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These calculations assumed that the GPC of NiO and CoO remained constant when going from standard cycles to supercycles. The calculated values turned out to be 10–20% less than the experimental ones, which indicates the stimulation of the growth of one or both phases on the surface of the other when using supercycles.
