<p>To prepare binary TMOs using ALD, we used the supercycle approach. This approach takes the common binary ALD cycles of precursor and coreactant pulses for each constituent process and combines them into a cycle of cycles [

 <sub>2</sub> phase, the ratio Ni/Co = 1; therefore, we used the ratio of the cycles of obtaining NiO and CoO in one supercycle, which is also equal to 1. However, given that growth per cycle (GPC) for CoO (0.22 Å) was almost twice the increase per cycle for NiO (0.12 Å), we also synthesized samples with a large number of NiO cycles in one supercycle (
