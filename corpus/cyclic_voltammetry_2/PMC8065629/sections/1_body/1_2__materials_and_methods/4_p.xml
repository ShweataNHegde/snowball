<p>X-ray reflectometry (XRR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies were performed with a Bruker D8 DISCOVER (Cu-Kα = 1.5406 Å) diffractometer. Surface-sensitive grazing incidence XRD (GIXRD) modes were used for XRD measurements using a 2θ range of 30–65° with a step of 0.1° and an exposure of 1 s at each step. The incidence angle of the primary X-ray beam was 0.7°. XRR measurements were performed in an angle range of 0.3–5° (increment 0.01°) using symmetric scattering geometry. The obtained results were processed by the Rietveld method using the TOPAS software package (ver. 5, Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA) and by the simplex method using the LEPTOS (ver. 7.7, Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA) for XRD and XRR, respectively.</p>
