<p>Scanning electron micrographs of planar and cross-sectional views were obtained by a Supra 55 VP scanning electron microscope (SEM, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with a Gemini-I column and a field emission cathode. Spatial resolution was about 1.3 nm at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. A total of 3–4 randomly selected positions on the surface of the sample were investigated. Everhart–Thornley and InLens secondary electron detectors were used for SEM studies. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis was performed using the INCA X-Max system (Oxford Instruments, High Wycombe, UK) installed on the SEM Supra 55 VP.</p>
