<p>ALD of nickel–cobalt oxide (NCO), nickel oxide (NO), and cobalt oxide (CO) were performed with a commercial R-150 setup (Picosun Oy, Espoo, Finland) at a temperature of 300 °C and a reactor base pressure of 8–12 hPa. Bis(cyclopentadienyl) nickel(II) and Bis(cyclopentadienyl) cobalt(II) (Ni(Cp)
 <sub>2</sub>, Co(Cp)
 <sub>2</sub>; 99%, Dalchem, Nizhny Novgorod, Russia) were used as the nickel and cobalt-containing precursors. Co(Cp)
 <sub>2</sub> and Ni(Cp)
 <sub>2</sub> were kept in stainless-steel bottles (Picohot™ 200, Picosun Oy) and heated during deposition to 160 and 110 °C, respectively. The pulse times and purge times were 1 s and 10 s for both Co(Cp)
 <sub>2</sub> and Ni(Cp)
 <sub>2</sub>. Remote oxygen plasma was used as a counter-reagent. The plasma power was 3 kW, with a frequency range of 1.9–3.2 MHz. The total plasma pulse time was 19.5 s (Ar purge during 0.5 s with flow rate 40 sccm; Ar and O
 <sub>2</sub> plasma purge during 14 s with flow rate 90 sccm; Ar purge during 5 s with flow rate 40 sccm). Deposition conditions were based on our previous studies devoted to obtaining cobalt and nickel oxide [
