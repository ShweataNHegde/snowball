<p>X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were acquired with an Escalab 250Xi spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The samples were sputtered by Ar
 <sup>+</sup> ions with an energy of 500 eV for 30 and 45 or 90 s. The samples were excited by Al-Kα (1486.7 eV) X-rays at a pressure of 7 × 10
 <sup>−8</sup> Pa.
