<p>Monocrystalline silicon substrates (surface orientation (100), 40 Ã— 40 mm, Telecom-STV Co., Ltd., Zelenograd, Russia) and stainless-steel plates (316SS, 16 mm diameter, Tob New Energy Technology Co., Ltd., Xiamen, China) were used as substrates for ALD. Prior to deposition, the silicon and stainless-steel substrates were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath in acetone and deionized water for 10 and 5 min, respectively. To remove the native silicon oxide layer, the silicon substrates were immersed for 5 min in 10% hydrofluoric acid solution(HF). Then, silicon substrates were cleaned using piranha solution (H
