<p>Stainless-steel plates with deposited films were used for electrochemical studies. Lithium foil, polyolefin porous film 2325 (Celgard, Charlotte, NC, USA), and TC-E918 (Tinci, Guangzhou, China) solutions were used as the counter, separator, and electrolyte, respectively. The composition of TC-E918 was a 1M solution of LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> in a mixture of organic carbonates (ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate, diethyl carbonate, ethyl methyl carbonate, vinylene carbonate). The coin cells (CR2032) were assembled in an argon atmosphere using an OMNI-LAB glove box (VAC). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed using a PGSTAT302N+ potentiostat (Autolab, Utrecht, The Netherlands) in a range of 0.01–3.00 V with a scan rate of 0.5 mV/s. Discharge tests at different current densities were run with a CT3008W-5V10mA charge/discharge stand (Neware, Shenzhen, China), calibrated to work with low currents in a voltage range from 3.00 V–0.01 V, and current densities of 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 480, 640, 800 µA/cm
 <sup>2</sup>. Deconvolution of the CV patterns was performed using the Origin (ver. 9.0.0) software package.
