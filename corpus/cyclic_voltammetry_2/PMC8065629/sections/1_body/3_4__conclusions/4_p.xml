<p>Electrochemical studies of all samples were carried out at charge current densities from 10 μA/cm
 <sup>2</sup> (about 0.3 C) to 800 μA/cm
 <sup>2</sup> (about 33 C). With an 80-fold increase in the current density, the samples’ discharge capacity decreased by only 21–33% (on average, from 920 to 655 µAh/cm
 <sup>2</sup>/µm). The moderate decrease in capacity was likely due to the small thickness of the films.
