<p>Thin films of nickel-cobalt oxide were successfully prepared by ALD using nickelocene and cobaltocene as metal-precursors, and remote oxygen plasma as a counter-reagent. Changing the ratio of metal-precursor pulses allowed precise changing and controlling of the film composition. The films obtained possessed a uniform chemical composition along the depth with an admixture of metallic nickel and carbon up to 4 at.%. Comparing growth rate data of mono oxides (NO and CO) with the rates of NCO oxides showed that the growth of the phase or phases of the binary metals oxide was increased.</p>
