<p>XRD data showed that NCO samples contained a spinel Ni
 <sub>x</sub>Co
 <sub>(1−x)</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-phase with a cubic structure Fm-3m. With increased Ni content of the Ni
 <sub>x</sub>Co
 <sub>1−x</sub>O phase, the unit cell parameter decreased from 4.244 to 4.161 Å. XRR data show that all samples consisted of a layer uniform in density with a roughness of 0.63 to 3.23 nm. With decreasing Ni content, the film density decreased from 6.60 to 6.31 g/cm
