<p>Small-sized power sources, with large cyclic capability and high energy density, such as solid-state lithium-ion batteries (SSLIB), are in demand owing to rapidly developing technologies including the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT concept involves the use of a large number of wireless miniature devices (sensors [
