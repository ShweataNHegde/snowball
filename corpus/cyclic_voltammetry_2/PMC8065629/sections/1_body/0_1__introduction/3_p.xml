<p>Binary transition metal oxides (TMOs), owing to their high capacity (e.g., ZnFeO
 <sub>2</sub>—700 mAh/g, ZnCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>—867 mAh/g, NiCoO
 <sub>2</sub>—716 mAh/g, NiCo
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>—891 mAh/g), are very promising materials for producing SSLIB anodes. However, low conductivity and relatively high-volume change during cycling are the main challenges limiting their use [

 <xref rid="B9-nanomaterials-11-00907" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Moreover, 2-D nanostructures, called nanofilms, can be used for producing thin-film SSLIBs to minimize the size of electronic devices.
