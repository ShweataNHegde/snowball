<p>The aim of this work was to prepare thin-film anodes of binary TMOs of nickel and cobalt by ALD using different ratios of pulses of metal-containing precursors. In addition to studying the composition, morphology and crystallinity of the deposited films, special attention was paid to characterizing the electrochemical properties.</p>
