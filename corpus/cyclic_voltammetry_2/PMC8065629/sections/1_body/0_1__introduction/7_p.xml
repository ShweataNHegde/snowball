<p>Previously, we showed an increase in the electrochemical activity of NiO anodes caused by an increase in the electrochemical activity of the SEI (solid electrolyte interphase) films [
 <xref rid="B55-nanomaterials-11-00907" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In this regard, the method for determining the capacity in disk cells using an electrolyte may be inaccurate due to the SEI contribution to the measured capacity. In addition, the growth rate of SEI films can depend on the nature of the anode material, which introduces additional uncertainty in the characteristics of the films under study. Fabricating multilayer structures of solid-state thin-film LIBs is a difficult task and the determining characteristics of active materials (anodes) can be limited by other system components such as the solid electrolyte and cathode. Therefore, within the framework of the described research objectives, an attempt was made to separate the various components in the results of electrochemical testing in a liquid electrolyte.
