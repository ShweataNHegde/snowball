<p>Galvanostatic charging/discharging has also been used to characterize supercapacitors and secondary batteries due to its relatively direct physical relationship to the capacitive charge. For an ideal capacitor, the triangular response upon a constant current with a small deviation at the vertex caused by the solution resistance can be predicted. However, the empirical results deviate severely from the theoretical model, thus raising issues with regard to the validity of the simple capacitor model for interpretation of results.</p>
