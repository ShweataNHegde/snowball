<p>In the light of the foregoing, we herein successfully synthesized the pearl necklace‐like hierarchical nanostructures of a novel P2‐Na
 <sub>0.76</sub>Cu
 <sub>0.22</sub>Fe
 <sub>0.30</sub>Mn
 <sub>0.48</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> cathode through electrospinning and fully dug out the effects of Cu
 <sup>2+</sup> doping on electrochemical properties. Such a distinctive nano‐necklace architecture assembled by secondary nanograins (50–150 nm, the smallest size ever reached for Fe/Mn‐based layered oxides) can expose rich active sites readily accessible to electrolyte, shorten the ionic diffusion distance, and alleviate the nanoparticles from aggregation upon repeated Na
 <sup>+</sup> insertion/extraction. Meanwhile, the Cu substitution of Fe is proved to accelerate the Na
 <sup>+</sup> transportation and restrain the Na
 <sup>+</sup>/vacancy ordering during cycling. Consequently, outstanding rate capability (125.4 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 0.1 C and 56.5 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 20 C) and excellent cycling stability (≈79% capacity retention after 300 cycles) between 2.0 and 4.0 V are simultaneously achieved. The reaction mechanism behind the superb performance regarding structure evolution and valence variation of Cu/Fe/Mn is monitored by in operando X‐ray diffraction (XRD) and ex situ X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Moreover, through galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT), cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and density functional theory (DFT) computations, the electrode process kinetics concerning Na‐ion diffusivity and Na
 <sup>+</sup> migration energy barrier are systematically investigated. In addition, a soft‐package sodium‐ion full battery employing the as‐prepared P2‐Na
 <sub>0.76</sub>Cu
 <sub>0.22</sub>Fe
 <sub>0.30</sub>Mn
 <sub>0.48</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> cathode and the hard carbon anode is well established, exhibiting bright practical prospects.
