<p>To sum up, a dual‐strategy of cation‐doping and nanoengineering was applied to obtain the pearl necklace‐like hierarchical nanostructures of a novel P2‐Na
 <sub>0.76</sub>Cu
 <sub>0.22</sub>Fe
 <sub>0.30</sub>Mn
 <sub>0.48</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> cathode through a feasible electrospinning method. On the one hand, the unique 1D nanostructures assembled by small nanograins could facilitate the accessibility to electrolyte, offer facile pathways for electrons/Na
 <sup>+</sup> ions transportation, and maintain the structural integrity upon repetitive Na
 <sup>+</sup> insertion/extraction. On the other hand, the Cu substitution of Fe created larger interstitial spaces in the oxide crystal through which sodium ions could rapidly diffuse, and efficaciously mitigated the Na
 <sup>+</sup>/vacancy ordering during cycling. Thus, an exceptional rate capability (125.4 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 0.1 C in comparison with 56.5 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 20 C) and a fascinating cyclability (≈79% capacity retention after 300 cycles) were simultaneously attained. In operando XRD and ex situ XPS were employed to track the highly reversible structure evolution and Cu/Fe/Mn valence change upon charge/discharge, and the positive effects of Cu doping on the reaction kinetics were further confirmed by GITT, CV, EIS, and DFT computations. More intriguingly, the prototype Na‐ion full battery constructed by the P2‐Na
 <sub>0.76</sub>Cu
 <sub>0.22</sub>Fe
 <sub>0.30</sub>Mn
 <sub>0.48</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> nano‐necklaces cathode and hard carbon anode delivered a distinguished energy density of 177.4 Wh kg
 <sup>−1</sup>, demonstrating a great promise for practical applications. We believe that the combination of metallic cation doping with hierarchical nanoengineering provides a new and ideal platform for enhancing the electrochemical performance of the layered oxide cathode materials for SIBs.
