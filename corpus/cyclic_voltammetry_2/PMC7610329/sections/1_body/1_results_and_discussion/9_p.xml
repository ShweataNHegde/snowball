 <sub>2</sub> nano‐necklaces cathode with the hard carbon anode. The hard carbon anode can deliver a reversible capacity of around 210 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup> with an operating potential of ≈0.13 V versus Na
 <sup>+</sup>/Na (Figure S20, Supporting Information). In this case, the active mass ratio of cathode to anode was set at 1.7:1 to balance the capacity. The full cell was tested at 0.1 C within the voltage window of 1.6–3.8 V, a reversible discharge capacity of 115 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup> along with an average working voltage of ≈2.45 V (based on the cathode active mass) can be acquired (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2021-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>), enabling a remarkable energy density of 177.4 Wh kg
 <sup>−1</sup> based on the total mass of cathode and anode active materials. Besides, light‐emitting diodes (LEDs) with different colors could be successfully lightened up by the pouch cell (inset of Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2021-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2021-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6c</xref> shows that a discharge capacity of 95.4 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup> is maintained after 100 cycles, corresponding to a promising capacity retention of 82%. The rate profiles depicted in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2021-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6d</xref> further reveal that prominent discharge capacities of 117.7 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 0.1 C and 55 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 20 C can be obtained.
