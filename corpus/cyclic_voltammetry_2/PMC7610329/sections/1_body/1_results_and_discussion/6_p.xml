To be more specific, the (002) and (004) peaks gradually shift leftward upon charging from 2.0 to 4.0 V, while the (100) and (102) peaks shift rightward at the meantime. These phenomena can be interpreted as the extraction of Na
 <sup>+</sup> gives rise to an increased repulsive electrostatic interaction of O
 <sup>2−</sup> from the neighboring transition metal layers, thus leading to an expansion of the interlayer spacing and a contraction of the TMO
 <sub>6</sub> octahedra, which reflect on the increase of 
 <italic>c</italic> parameter and the decrease of 
 <italic>a</italic> parameter. Upon discharging from 4.0 to 2.0 V, an eminent reversibility can be observed, since all the abovementioned peaks move toward the opposite direction compared to the shift in charging process. It is found that the (00
 <italic>l</italic>) peaks move to higher angles and the (10
 <italic>l</italic>) peaks move to lower angles at the end of discharging, compared with the pristine state. This is resulted from the extra high Coulombic efficiency in the initial cycle (as shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2021-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Moreover, it is worth noticing that the peaks of (004) and (100) split into two peaks in the high‐voltage region but swiftly merge into one peak along with the voltage decreasing, indicating the transient existence of a two‐phase reaction region caused by the Na
 <sup>+</sup>/vacancy ordering, meanwhile, proving the good reversibility of the Cu‐doped samples. The lattice parameters evolution of P2‐Na
