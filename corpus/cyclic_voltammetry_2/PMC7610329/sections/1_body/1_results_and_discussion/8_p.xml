Note that the atomic positions of Na, Cu, Fe, and Mn are simulated based on their atomic ratios and occupancies (Table S1 in the Supporting Information), and the migration path near the Cu‐doping site is selected to figure out the effect of Cu‐doping on the Na
 <sup>+</sup> migration behavior in the layered oxide lattice. As elucidated in Figure
