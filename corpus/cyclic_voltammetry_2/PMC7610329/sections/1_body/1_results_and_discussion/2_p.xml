 <italic>/mmc</italic> (JCPDS No. 54–0894), meanwhile, a good agreement between the experimental and the calculated data is obtained (

 <sup>2+</sup> in the P2‐structure, the presence of minor CuO impurity (3.5%) is confirmed. This phenomenon has also been reported before in other copper‐doped P2‐phase materials.

The P2‐type crystalline structure acquired from the fitted results is plotted in Figure

 <sup>]</sup> The Cu/Fe/Mn ions occupy the octahedral sites of TMO
 <sub>2</sub> layers in a random distribution. Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2021-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1c</xref> clearly displays the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the electrospun precursor sample, presenting smooth and continuous nanofibers that weave into a 3D network. After a thermal treatment at 850 °C for 6 h, the continuous 1D nanostructures are inherited and still maintain an average diameter of around 200 nm (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2021-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>); myriads of irregular nanograins string tightly together to constitute the pearl necklace‐like hierarchitectures. When viewed at a lower magnification, the as‐spun nanofibers and the annealed nano‐necklaces both demonstrate a wide‐range and uniform production (Figure S1, Supporting Information). The microstructure is further scrutinized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2021-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>) and high‐magnification SEM image (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information), disclosing that the sizes of the secondary nanograins mostly range from 50 to 150 nm. To the best of our knowledge, these are the smallest particles ever reported for the Fe/Mn‐based layered oxides. The high‐resolution TEM (HRTEM) image is subsequently presented in Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2021-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>, intuitively corroborating the layered structure of P2‐Na

 <sub>2</sub> with the (002) interplanar distance of 0.56 nm, as is also validated in the fast Fourier transform (FFT) image (inset of Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2021-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). The selected‐area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2021-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>) featuring concentric rings suggests the polycrystalline nature of the Na

 <sub>2</sub> nanograins. The narrower lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.23 nm can be well attributed to the (102) plane (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2021-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1h</xref>). Meanwhile, the high‐angle annular dark field (HAADF) TEM image (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2021-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1i</xref>) also exhibits the (102) plane and the bright dots depict the positions of transition metal (Cu/Fe/Mn) atoms. A homogenous distribution of elements in the P2‐Na

 <sub>2</sub> nano‐necklaces such as Na, Cu, Fe, Mn, and O is verified by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping (Figure 
 <xref rid="advs2021-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1j</xref>). Besides, in order to gain the ideal structure and morphology, the calcination temperature and time have been adjusted reasonably (Figures S3 and S4 in the Supporting Information). It is found that a mixture of P3 + P2 phases is obtained at a low temperature of 750 °C. With the temperature rising to 800 °C, the percentage of P3 phase is decreasing and the P2 phase gradually plays a dominant role. Finally, the pure phase of P2‐Na
 <sub>0.76</sub>Cu
 <sub>0.22</sub>Fe
 <sub>0.30</sub>Mn
 <sub>0.48</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> is achieved at 850 °C. Moreover, a sintering time of 2 h is too short for the target necklace‐morphology to form uniformly, while a long time (10 h) will cause the collapse of necklace‐framework and the local agglomeration of oxide nanograins. Therefore, it is believed that an annealing temperature of 850 °C with a time of 6 h should be the most appropriate condition in this work.
