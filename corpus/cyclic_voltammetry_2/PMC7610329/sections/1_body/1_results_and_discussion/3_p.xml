<p>TEM‐EDS spectrum and mapping images (Figure S5, Supporting Information) reveal that the molar ratio of Na:Cu:Fe:Mn in the as‐prepared oxide is 0.76:0.22:0.30:0.48, and the elements are homogenously distributed in a single nanograin. The inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis further ascertains that the Na/Cu/Fe/Mn molar ratio is in good accordance with the anticipated values. The chemical compositions of the Na
