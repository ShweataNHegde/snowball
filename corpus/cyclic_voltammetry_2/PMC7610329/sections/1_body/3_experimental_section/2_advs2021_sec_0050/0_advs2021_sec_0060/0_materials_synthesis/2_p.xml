<p>After overnight stirring, electrospinning was carried out by loading the as‐prepared fluid into a plastic syringe equipped with a 21‐gauge blunt‐tip needle. The solution was electrospun by a high voltage of 17 kV applied between the needle tip and the aluminium foil collector, with a distance of 15 cm, at a feeding rate of 15 µL min
 <sup>−1</sup>. Consequently, an ≈150 µm thick membrane could be obtained by electrospinning at 35 °C for 36 h.
