<p>Crystallographic properties of the annealed products were determined by XRD (Rigaku D/Max‐2500) with filtered Cu K
 <italic>α</italic> radiation (
 <italic>λ</italic> = 1.5418 Å) in the 2
 <italic>θ</italic> range of 10°–90°. Morphological and microstructural studies were scrutinized by field‐emission scanning electron microscopy (FE‐SEM, JEOL JSM7500F) and TEM (TECNAI G2 20). Elemental analyses were ascertained by SEM‐ and TEM‐energy dispersive X‐ray spectrometer (EDS) mapping. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms obtained on a Micromeritics ASAP 2460 instrument (MicroActive) at 77 K were applied to evaluate the porosity and specific surface area. Raman spectra were gathered on a confocal Raman microscope (Thermo‐Fisher Scientific) using an argon‐ion laser (
 <italic>λ</italic> = 532 nm) in ambient air. The chemical content was ascertained by ICP atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP‐AES, Varian 725‐ES). X‐ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS, Perkin Elmer PHI 1600 ESCA) was applied to investigate the valence states of the elements during cycling.
