<p>After electrospinning, the as‐spun membrane was peeled off from the Al foil collector and thermally treated in a following step‐wise process: 350 °C for 2 h (heating rate: 1 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup>), 500 °C for 2 h (heating rate: 2 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup>), and 850 °C for 6 h (heating rate: 3 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup>) in ambient air. Adopting slow heating rates in a step‐wise calcination process was to protect the pearl necklace‐like nanostructure from collapse. After careful calculation, the cost for synthesizing 100 mg of the target nano‐necklace materials was around 4.59 USD. This implied that the present nanoengineering technique was relatively cost‐effective, and was suitable for large‐scale production by adopting the multi‐nozzle equipment. Besides, the final calcination temperature (750, 800, or 850 °C) and time (2, 6, or 10 h) were modulated to optimize the synthesis conditions.
