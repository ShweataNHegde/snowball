<p>When it comes to in operando XRD characterizations, a particular mold battery was assembled employing beryllium foil as the testing window to allow X‐ray passage and carbon paper as the current collector, thus monitoring in situ reaction during cycling. Each scan was recorded in 0.02° incremental steps between 2
 <italic>θ</italic> = 12° and 42°. The charge/discharge test was conducted at 0.1 C.
