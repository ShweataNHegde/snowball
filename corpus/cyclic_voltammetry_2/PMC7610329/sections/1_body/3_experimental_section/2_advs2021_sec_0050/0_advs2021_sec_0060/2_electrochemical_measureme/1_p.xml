<p>All electrochemical properties were examined in CR2032 coin‐type cells assembled in a glove box (Mikrouna Universal 2440/750) filled with high‐purity argon. Electrodes were fabricated by casting slurries, the composition of which was 75 wt% active materials, 15 wt% acetylene black, and 10 wt% PVdF dissolved in 
 <italic>N</italic>‐methyl‐2‐pyrrolidone, onto Al foil, followed by drying at 80 °C in vacuum overnight. Then the electrodes were cut into suitable‐size slices with a mass loading of about 2.5 mg cm
 <sup>−2</sup>. The counter and reference electrode of sodium metal disk was put face‐to‐face with the working electrode sandwiched by a glass fiber separator in the coin cells. 1

 <sub>4</sub> in propylene carbonate solution with the addition of 5 vol% fluoroethylene carbonate was employed as the electrolyte. Besides, the assembled cells were placed for 6 h before tests to make sure that the electrolyte soaked into the separators and electrodes completely. The coin cells were galvanostatically charged/discharged on a LAND battery‐test instrument (CT2001A) in a voltage interval of 2.0–4.0 V (vs Na/Na
 <sup>+</sup>). The tests of cyclic voltammetry within the same voltage region at various scan rates and EIS with the ac perturbation signal of 5.0 mV over the frequency from 100 kHz to 100 mHz were used to study the electrode process kinetics, which were both conducted using a CHI660C electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua, China). The EIS spectra were recorded at open circuit voltage. Prior to the post‐mortem examinations of the cycled active materials using XRD, XPS, or SEM, the electrodes were taken out from the cells and washed with dimethyl carbonate repeatedly in an argon‐filled glove box.
