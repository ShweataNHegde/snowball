<p>The ionic/electronic conductivity of P2‐Na

 <sub>2</sub> was evaluated by ab initio computations based on the DFT via Vienna ab‐initio simulation package (VASP). The projector augmented wave method with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof function was employed. The cut‐off energy and 
 <italic>k</italic>‐point separation were set to 500 eV and 0.03 Å
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. Moreover, the Na‐ion migration paths and barriers were thoroughly ascertained by the bond valence energy landscape and cNEB methods.
