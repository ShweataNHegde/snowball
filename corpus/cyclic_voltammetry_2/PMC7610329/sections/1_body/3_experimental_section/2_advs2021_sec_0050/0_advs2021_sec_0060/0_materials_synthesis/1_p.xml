 <sub>2</sub> nano‐necklaces were fabricated via a feasible electrospinning method with subsequent heat treatments. In order to prepare the precursor solution, 4.4 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone (average Mw = 13 00 000, Aladdin) was first dissolved in 30 mL of deionized water under magnetic stirring at room temperature. After complete dissolution, 4 mL of CH

 <sub>2</sub>·4H
 <sub>2</sub>O (99.9%, Aldrich), 5.985 mmol (5% excess) of NaNO
