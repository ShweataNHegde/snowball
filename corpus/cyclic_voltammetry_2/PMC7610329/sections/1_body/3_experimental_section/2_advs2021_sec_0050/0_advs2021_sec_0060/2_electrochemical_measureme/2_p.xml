<p>To construct the full cells, the pre‐sodiated hard carbon was adopted as the anode and well matched with the P2‐Na
 <sub>0.76</sub>Cu
 <sub>0.22</sub>Fe
 <sub>0.30</sub>Mn
 <sub>0.48</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> cathode. The active mass loading ratio of cathode to anode was set at 1.7:1 to balance the capacity. Finally, the full cell was measured within a voltage window of 1.6–3.8 V.
