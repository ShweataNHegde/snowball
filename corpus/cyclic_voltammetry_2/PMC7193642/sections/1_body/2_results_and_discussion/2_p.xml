<p id="Par13">The difference in stability is related to the chemical structures of the electrolytes. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(d)</xref> shows the 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra of the Ph
 <sub>3</sub>COMgCl- and Ph
 <sub>3</sub>SiOMgCl-based electrolytes as prepared and after three weeks. The 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of the Ph
 <sub>3</sub>COMgCl-based electrolyte from 7.20 to 7.35 ppm changes between after preparation (blue) and after three weeks (red), which suggests the structural change of the Ph
 <sub>3</sub>CO
 <sup>–</sup> anion during preservation in the glove box. This chemical instability is hypothesized to be the cause of the change in the cyclic voltammogram of the Ph
 <sub>3</sub>COMgCl-based electrolyte in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(c)</xref>. On the other hand, the Ph
 <sub>3</sub>SiOMgCl-based electrolyte shows almost the same 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum as prepared (green) and after three weeks (purple), which indicates that the initial structure of the Ph
 <sub>3</sub>SiO
 <sup>–</sup> anion is maintained. Although the difference between the magnesium salts used in the electrolytes is only a single element, the Ph
 <sub>3</sub>SiOMgCl-based electrolyte shows lower anodic stability and higher chemical stability compared with the Ph
 <sub>3</sub>COMgCl-based electrolyte. The shape of the CV curve of the B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-based electrolyte is nearly the same even after three weeks, which suggests the chemical stability of the BO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>3−</sup> anion structure (Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> in the Supporting Information). Chemical stability may be related to the strengths of the Si–O, B–O, and C–O bonds.
