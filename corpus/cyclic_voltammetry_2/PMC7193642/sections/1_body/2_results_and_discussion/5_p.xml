 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(c,d)</xref> show the linear sweep voltammograms of the B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-based electrolyte in triglyme and triglyme-THF, respectively. The B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-based electrolyte in triglyme shows anodic stability over 3.0 V vs. Mg using Pt and GC. However, its anodic stability decreases to 1.6 V using Al and 2.0 V using SUS. This behavior is also observed in the B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>/triglyme-THF electrolyte. The trend in the anodic stability of the B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-based electrolyte is Al &lt; SUS &lt; Pt, GC regardless of the solvent. The same trend is observed in bisamide- and dialkoxide-based electrolytes, which indicates that Cl
 <sup>–</sup> has an oxidatively unfavorable effect on Al and SUS

 </sup>. Using Mo, the B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-based electrolyte in triglyme shows an anodic stability of about 3.0 V, while the B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-based electrolyte in triglyme-THF shows a weak decomposition current from 2.0 V and increased current at about 3.0 V vs. Mg. Pt and GC can be used as current collectors with the B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-based electrolyte up to 3.0 V vs. Mg, and SUS up to about 2.0 V vs. Mg. Mo can be used with the B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-based electrolyte in triglyme up to approximately 3.0 V vs. Mg.
