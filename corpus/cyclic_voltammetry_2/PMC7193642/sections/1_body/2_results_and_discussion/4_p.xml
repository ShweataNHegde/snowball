<p id="Par15">The cyclic voltammograms of the B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-based electrolyte in triglyme and triglyme-THF are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(a,b)</xref>, respectively. Cathodic and anodic currents around 0 V vs. Mg appear repeatedly in each cycle, which suggests that magnesium metal reversibly plates and strips on Pt within the CV measurement range. The B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-based electrolyte in triglyme shows an overpotential of approximately 570 mV at 1.0 mA/cm
 <sup>2</sup>. Coulombic efficiency improves from 38.2% at the first cycle to 57.6% at the 30
 <sup>th</sup> cycle. However, it is 64.0% even at the 100
 <sup>th</sup> cycle, which indicates that the Coulombic efficiency of the B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-based electrolyte in triglyme is not improved by the conditioning process as previously reported

 </sup>. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(b)</xref>, the use of a triglyme-THF mixed solvent results in improved current density, probably because THF has a lower viscosity than triglyme

 </sup>. The overpotential of the B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-based electrolyte in triglyme-THF is approximately 490 mV at 1.0 mA/cm
 <sup>2</sup>. The conductivity of the B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-based electrolyte at 27 °C improves from 2.15 mS/cm without THF to 3.8 mS/cm with THF. Thus, the current density is enhanced by adding THF. The Coulombic efficiency of the B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-based electrolyte increases from 43.4% at the first cycle to 62.8% at the 30
 <sup>th</sup> cycle. The cycle dependency of Coulombic efficiency is illustrated in Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref> in the Supporting Information. The origin of the insufficient overvoltage and Coulombic efficiency will be discussed after the characterization of the electrolyte.
