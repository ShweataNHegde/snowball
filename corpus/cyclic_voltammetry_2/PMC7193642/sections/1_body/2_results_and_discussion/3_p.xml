<p id="Par14">Density functional theory calculations suggest that chemical stability is related to the strength of C–O, Si–O, and B–O bonds of anions determined using the hard and soft acids and bases principle (Supporting Information), further implying that the C–O bond of Ph
 <sub>3</sub>COMgCl-based electrolytes can be weakened by Ph substitution (Supporting Information). Moreover, according to previous reports, the Lewis acidic character of B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub> may enhance the anodic stability of the electrolyte

 </sup>. Interestingly, elemental differences in the structure can change electrolyte properties, such as anodic stability and chemical stability. The B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-based electrolyte shows both excellent anodic stability and chemical stability despite its low Coulombic efficiency. Therefore, we will discuss this electrolyte in more detail.
