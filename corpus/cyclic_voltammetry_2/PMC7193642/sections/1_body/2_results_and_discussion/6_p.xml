<p id="Par17">We confirmed that the plated product is Mg metal without dendritic formation. SEM images of plated magnesium from the B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-based electrolyte in triglyme and triglyme-THF on Pt are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4(a,b)</xref>, respectively. The SEM images show that the magnesium from the B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-based electrolytes in different solvents appears to co-exist with a few grain-like particles and flat surface. The products from either electrolyte do not show dendritic morphology. The magnesium deposited from both electrolytes does not have a well-defined crystal morphology, and its grain size appears to be smaller than 2 μm. The crystalline edges are not clear, probably caused by the long-term reduction during sample preparation. Density functional theory calculations revealed the cathodic instability of Mg-coordinated glyme electrolytes

 <sub>3</sub>-based electrolyte, resulting in the mossy structure observed in the SEM images. Synchrotron radiation XRD measurement confirmed that the precipitate is magnesium, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4(c)</xref>. Both XRD patterns for the B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-based electrolytes with/without THF show the peaks at the same position as those of the reference for Mg, although the scattering pattern in the (002) plane at 2θ = 15.4° is slightly smaller. Previous reports suggest that a small reflection of the (002) plane for magnesium represents a small grain size

 </sup>. Plated magnesium can become polycrystalline depending on the precipitation conditions, and the change appears in the (002) plane, which is the close-packed surface of the magnesium crystal

 <sub>3</sub>-based electrolytes is considered to be caused by the influence of such polycrystallization.
