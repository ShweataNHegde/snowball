<p id="Par12">We first examined the electrochemical behaviors of the Ph
 <sub>3</sub>COMgCl-, Ph
 <sub>3</sub>SiOMgCl-, and B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-based electrolytes. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(a)</xref> displays the cyclic voltammograms of the electrolytes, prepared by mixing a magnesium salt with AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> in triglyme, at the 100
 <sup>th</sup> cycle. They show reversible cathodic and anodic currents with Mg plating and stripping at 0 V vs. Mg. The B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-based electrolyte shows the highest reversible current density for Mg plating and stripping. The cyclic voltammograms of the Ph
 <sub>3</sub>COMgCl- and Ph
 <sub>3</sub>SiOMgCl-based electrolytes, consisting of magnesium salts of similar structure, exhibit similar shapes with almost the same current densities. The Coulombic efficiencies are 75.7%, 81.5%, and 64.0% for the Ph
 <sub>3</sub>COMgCl-, Ph
 <sub>3</sub>SiOMgCl-, and B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-based electrolytes, respectively. The three electrolytes have different anodic stabilities. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(b)</xref> displays the linear sweep voltammograms of the electrolytes. The linear sweep voltammogram of the Ph
 <sub>3</sub>COMgCl-based electrolyte shows anodic stability close to approximately 3.0 V vs. Mg. On the other hand, for the Ph
 <sub>3</sub>SiOMgCl-based electrolyte, a weak oxidation current is observed at 2.6 V, and the anodic current increases at about 3.0 V, which is close to the decomposition potential of the Ph
 <sub>3</sub>COMgCl-based electrolyte. Comparison of the linear sweep voltammograms of the Ph
 <sub>3</sub>COMgCl- and Ph
 <sub>3</sub>SiOMgCl-based electrolytes shows that the central element influences anodic stability. Among these electrolytes, the B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-based electrolyte shows the highest anodic stability over 3.0 V. The B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-based electrolyte also exhibits long-term stability. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(c)</xref> shows the cyclic voltammograms of the Ph
 <sub>3</sub>COMgCl- and Ph
 <sub>3</sub>SiOMgCl-based electrolytes measured three weeks after the first measurement in the presence of 0.1 ppm each of H
 <sub>2</sub>O and O
 <sub>2</sub> in an argon-filled glove box. The Ph
 <sub>3</sub>COMgCl-based electrolyte shows no current associated with magnesium plating/striping, while the Ph
 <sub>3</sub>SiOMgCl-based electrolyte shows almost the same CV curve even after three weeks.
