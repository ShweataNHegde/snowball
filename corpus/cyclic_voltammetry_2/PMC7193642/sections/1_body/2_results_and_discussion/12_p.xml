 <sup>11</sup>B NMR spectra of a B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-AlCl
 <sub>3</sub>/triglyme sample diluted with THF-
 <italic>d</italic>
 <sub>8</sub> and B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub> sample dissolved in CD
 <sub>3</sub>OD/CD
 <sub>3</sub>CO
 <sub>2</sub>D (50:50 vol%). The 
 <sup>11</sup>B NMR spectrum of the B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-AlCl
 <sub>3</sub>/triglyme electrolyte shows an increase in the intensity of the broad peak at around 6 ppm with a decrease in the intensity of the peak at approximately 19 ppm compared with those in the 
 <sup>11</sup>B NMR spectrum of B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>. This suggests that the former peak is due to the BO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>3–</sup> species. Furthermore, these changes in the peak intensities suggest the possibility of rapid exchange of coordination of the borate anion to solvents, Cl
 <sup>–</sup>, and Al species, among others.
