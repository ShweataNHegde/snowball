 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8(c)</xref> represents the Al 
 <italic>K</italic>-edge XANES spectra of the four electrolytes, which are AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> with or without B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub> dissolved in triglyme or triglyme-THF. Both AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> electrolytes without B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub> in triglyme (blue) and triglyme-THF (pink) show two edges located at 1565 (with a shoulder at around 1566 eV) and 1568 eV. The shoulder at 1566 eV is smaller and the peak at 1568 eV is larger for AlCl
 <sub>3</sub>/triglyme compared with those for AlCl
 <sub>3</sub>/triglyme-THF. These results are consistent with those of 
 <sup>27</sup>Al NMR showing a smaller peak at 62–68 ppm (due to AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> species) and larger peak at 27 ppm (due to AlCl
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> species) for AlCl
 <sub>3</sub>/triglyme compared with those for AlCl
 <sub>3</sub>/triglyme-THF. The Al 
 <italic>K</italic>-edge XANES spectra of the AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> electrolytes with B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub> show distinctly different absorption curves from those of the AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> electrolytes without B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub> in both triglyme and triglyme-THF. The increase of the edge at 1565 eV with the decrease of both the shoulder at around 1566 eV and edge at 1568 eV are consistent with the increase of the amount of AlCl
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>−</sup> and decrease of the amounts of both AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> and AlCl
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> observed in the 
 <sup>27</sup>Al-NMR measurement. The edge at 1565 eV, shoulder at around 1566 eV, and edge at 1568 eV in the Al 
 <italic>K</italic>-edge XANES spectra are deduced to be related to AlCl
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>, AlCl
 <sub>3</sub>, and AlCl
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>+</sup>, respectively.
