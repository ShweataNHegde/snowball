<p id="Par18">Although Mg plating and stripping with high anodic stability is observed, the Coulombic efficiency is approximately 60% at the 100
 <sup>th</sup> cycle. We will discuss the possibility of this Coulombic efficiency considering the chemical structure of the B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-based electrolytes inferred from FTIR, NMR, and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analyses. First, we rule out the possibility of residual B(OH)
 <sub>3</sub>. FTIR measurements of the B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub> product, B(OH)
 <sub>3</sub> reactant, and THF solvent are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5(a)</xref>. While the absorption related to the 
 <italic>γ</italic>
 <sub>O–H</sub> peak of B(OH)
 <sub>3</sub> (red) at about 3200 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> is not observed in the spectrum of B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>, absorptions with similar shape to those of THF (green) are observed in the range of 800–1100 and 2800–3100 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The absorption at the latter is attributed to the 
 <italic>ν</italic>
 <sub>C–H</sub> of THF and those at 877 and 1026 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> are attributed to the red-shifts of 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>C–C–O</sub> (905 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>) and 
 <italic>γ</italic>
 <sub>C–O</sub> (1065 cm

 <sup>

 </sup>. These results imply the consumption of the B(OH)
 <sub>3</sub> reactant, which is also supported by the absence of the associated peak in the XRD pattern of the synthesized B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub> shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5(b)</xref>. The absence of diffraction peaks suggests that the B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub> salt has a disordered molecular arrangement and no other magnesium salt such as MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> is formed. The 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra of B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub> and B(OH)
 <sub>3</sub> dissolved in DMSO-

 <sub>6</sub> are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5(c)</xref>. The broad O–H peak at 5.8 ppm detected in B(OH)
 <sub>3</sub> is not observed in B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>, which further proves that B(OH)
 <sub>3</sub> is completely consumed in the reaction, as implied by the FTIR and XRD results. The new peaks observed at 1.76 and 3.59 ppm indicate that THF remains in the synthesized magnesium salt
