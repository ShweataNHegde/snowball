 <sub>3</sub>/triglyme and B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-AlCl
 <sub>3</sub>/triglyme-THF, which are electrolytes containing magnesium salt. The reduced peaks of pentacoordinated AlCl

 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> (27 ppm) in the B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-based electrolyte suggest that these species are bound to the borate anion.
