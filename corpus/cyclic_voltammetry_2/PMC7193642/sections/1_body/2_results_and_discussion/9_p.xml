<p id="Par20">B(OH)
 <sub>3</sub> is not detected in the FTIR, XRD, and 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR measurements, and the BO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>3−</sup> unit remains in the B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub> salt according to the 
 <sup>11</sup>B NMR measurement. Moreover, the molar ratio of B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>, measured by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy and Cl titration, is B:Mg:Cl = 1:3:3. These results indicate that the Grignard reagent mainly reacts with B(OH)
 <sub>3</sub> as a Brønsted acid to form B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>. B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub> does not show the ordered arrangement and disproportionated structures observed in the XRD measurement. In addition, the FTIR and 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra suggest that THF is coordinated to B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>. Based on these results, the synthesized B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub> salt has the structure shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6(a)</xref>, in which THF is coordinated to B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>, and a more complicated structure with a disordered network (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6(b)</xref>).
