<p id="Par30">We have confirmed the high chemical and long-term stability of the B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-based electrolytes and have characterized these electrolytes. Finally, the application of these electrolytes to magnesium rechargeable battery was examined. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9(a,b)</xref> represent the galvanostatic charge-discharge profiles of the Mo
 <sub>6</sub>S
 <sub>8</sub>/AZ31 coin-type cells with B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-AlCl
 <sub>3</sub>/triglyme and B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-AlCl
 <sub>3</sub>/triglyme-THF. Both profiles show plateaus at ~1.05 and ~1.20 V and reversible charge/discharge cycles at a capacity of approximately 80 mAh/g for 30 cycles. The profile of the cell with the B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-AlCl
 <sub>3</sub>/triglyme-THF electrolyte shows a slightly smaller gap between the charge-discharge plateaus compared with that of the cell with the B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-AlCl
 <sub>3</sub>/triglyme electrolyte. These results verify that, with B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-based electrolytes, the charge-discharge cycles are repeated on cells with a Chevrel phase cathode and magnesium anode. This indicates that Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> insertion/de-insertion into/from the Chevrel phase with Mg plating/stripping proceeds repeatedly. In addition, it also confirms that SUS can be used with a B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-based electrolyte up to 1.9 V vs. Mg. The B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-AlCl
 <sub>3</sub>/triglyme electrolyte can be used in higher-voltage cathodes (up to 2.1 V vs. Mg)
