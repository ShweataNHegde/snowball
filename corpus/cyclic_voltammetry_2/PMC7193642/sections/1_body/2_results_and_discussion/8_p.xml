<p id="Par19">Although the B(OH)
 <sub>3</sub> itself no longer remains, the presence of the BO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>3−</sup> unit is confirmed by the 
 <sup>11</sup>B NMR spectra of B(OH)
 <sub>3</sub> and B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>, which were both dissolved in CD
 <sub>3</sub>OD/CD
 <sub>3</sub>CO
 <sub>2</sub>D (50/50 vol%) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5(d)</xref>). The main peak in the 
 <sup>11</sup>B NMR spectrum of B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub> is located at around 19 ppm, which is almost the same as that of B(OH)
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>
 </sup>. The presence of this peak indicates that the BO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>3−</sup> unit remains in the structure of B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>. The origin of the other peaks (around 2 and 32.4 ppm) are unknown at present. However, these peaks are unrelated to the solvents used for the measurement (CD
 <sub>3</sub>OD and CD
 <sub>3</sub>CO
 <sub>2</sub>D) because they are also detected in the B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-based electrolytes described later.
