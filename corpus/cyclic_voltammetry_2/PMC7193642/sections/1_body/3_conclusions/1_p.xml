<p id="Par31">In this study, three novel electrolytes based on Ph
 <sub>3</sub>COMgCl, Ph
 <sub>3</sub>SiOMgCl, and B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub> were successfully prepared, and the electrochemical properties were investigated. The Ph
 <sub>3</sub>COMgCl-based electrolyte showed higher anodic stability than the Ph
 <sub>3</sub>SiOMgCl-based electrolyte, and the B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-based electrolyte showed the highest anodic stability among the three electrolytes. Moreover, the latter was chemically stable, which was ascribed to the Lewis acidic character of boron in B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>. Analyses of B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub> showed that the Grignard reagent mainly reacted with B(OH)
 <sub>3</sub> as a Brønsted acid and revealed that the BO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>3−</sup> unit derived from B(OH)
 <sub>3</sub> remained in B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>. In addition, the electrochemically positive Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> ion is the main species present. Charge-discharge measurements performed for the B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-based electrolyte, a Mo
 <sub>6</sub>S
 <sub>8</sub> Chevrel phase cathode, and an AZ31 anode were indicative of a reversible charge-discharge capacity, suggesting that hardly any side reaction occurred inside SUS cells with the B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-based electrolyte at 1.9 V. Although the B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-based electrolyte did not show high Coulombic efficiency, it showed high anodic stability and can therefore be used in the development of positive electrodes for magnesium batteries.
