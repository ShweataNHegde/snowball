<p id="Par9">CV and LSV were performed in an argon-filled glovebox (&lt;0.1 ppm each of water and oxygen) using an electrochemical measurement system (VMP3, Bio-Logic Science Instruments). CV measurements were conducted within the potential range of −1.0 to 3.5 V vs. Mg at a scan rate of 5 mV/s using a three-electrode cell. This cell has Pt (diameter (
 <italic>φ</italic>): 3.0 mm, disk, BAS Co., Ltd.), Mg (
 <italic>φ</italic>: 1.6 mm, rod, 99.95%, Nilaco Co., Ltd.), and Mg (
 <italic>φ</italic>: 1.6 mm, rod, 99.95%, Nilaco Co., Ltd.) as the working, reference, and counter electrodes, respectively, immersed in 2 mL of electrolyte. LSV measurements were conducted within the potential range of OCP to 3.5 V vs. Mg at a scan rate of 5 mV/s using the same cell, but with various working electrodes. These working electrodes include Pt (

 <italic>φ</italic>: 3.0 mm, disk, BAS Co., Ltd.), Al (thickness: 0.1 mm, plate, 99.999%, Nilaco Co., Ltd.), SUS304 (thickness: 0.2 mm, plate, Nilaco Co., Ltd.), and Mo (
