<p id="Par10">The galvanostatic deposition of magnesium was carried out in a three-electrode cell under a current density of 1 mA/cm
 <sup>2</sup> applied to the Pt working electrode for 50 h. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (S-4800, Hitachi, Ltd.) to observe the precipitate on the electrode. Synchrotron XRD measurements of plated magnesium were performed at beamline BL5S2 of the Aichi Synchrotron Radiation Center (Japan). A glass capillary with an outer diameter of 0.3 mm was filled with the sample and sealed by a resin in an argon-filled glove box. XRD data were collected using a Debye-Scherrer optical system with a two-dimensional semiconductor detector (PILATUS 100 K, Dectris). The wavelength of the X-ray was calibrated to
