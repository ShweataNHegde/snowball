<p id="Par7">The magnesium salts, Ph
 <sub>3</sub>COMgCl, Ph
 <sub>3</sub>SiOMgCl, and B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>, were prepared by reacting benzophenone, triphenylsilanol, and boric acid, respectively, with a Grignard reagent. The schematic synthetic routes of the magnesium salts used in this study are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The detailed procedures are described in the Supporting Information. 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR measurements confirmed the disappearance of the O–H proton of the reactant. Titration indicated that the ratio of magnesium and chlorine coordinated to THF was Mg:Cl = 1:1 for all magnesium salts. In an argon-filled glove box, each magnesium salt in triglyme was heated at 40 °C. Aluminum chloride was added, and the reaction mixture was stirred and then cooled to room temperature. The preparation conditions are shown in Table
