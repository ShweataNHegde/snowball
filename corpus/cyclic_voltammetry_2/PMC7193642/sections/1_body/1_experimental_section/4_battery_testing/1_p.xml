The electrode slurry consisted of 80 wt% active material, 10 wt% acetylene black (DENKA BLACK, Denka Co., Ltd.), and 10 wt% polyvinylidene fluoride (KF Polymer L#7305, Kureha Corporation) dissolved in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone using a planetary ball mill. The slurry was coated onto carbon paper, which served as the current collector, and dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 1 h and subsequently at 120 °C for 5 h. It was reported that carbon electrode is stable during magnesium charge-discharge

 </sup>. The resulting sheet, along with those of AZ31 (thickness: 0.5 mm, Izumi Metal Corporation) and glass fiber filter (GA100, Advantec), were cut into disks 16 mm in diameter to form the cathode, anode, and separator, respectively. The test cell was prepared by laminating the cathode, separator, and AZ31 anode on a CR2032 coin-type cell (Hohsen Corp.), which was then filled with electrolyte. Galvanostatic charge-discharge tests were carried out at a constant current of C/50 rate and temperature of 25 °C using a charge/discharge unit (ABE 1024-05R1, Electrofield). The experimental conditions were based on the theoretical capacity of Mo
