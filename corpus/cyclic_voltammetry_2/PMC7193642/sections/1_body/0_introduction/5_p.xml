<p id="Par6">The development of magnesium batteries requires magnesium electrolytes to show high anodic stability, be safe and easy to handle, and allow reversible magnesium plating and stripping. From the viewpoint of safety, it is desirable for the magnesium electrolyte to contain species that impart low flammability, low reactivity with ambient air, and other such properties

 </sup>. In addition, previous reports suggest that electrolytes containing an inorganic anion show higher anodic stability than those containing alkyl or alkoxide anions

 <sub>3</sub>COMgCl, Ph
 <sub>3</sub>SiOMgCl, and B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>, in triglyme and AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> solvents were synthesized and investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). In addition to electrochemical performance, chemical stability was discussed on the basis of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. The B(OMgCl)
 <sub>3</sub>-based electrolyte, which showed high anodic stability, was further studied by NMR spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS).
