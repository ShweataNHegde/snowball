<p id="Par2">Rechargeable magnesium batteries are promising alternatives to lithium-ion batteries, featuring high theoretical volumetric capacity (3832 mAh/cm
 <sup>3</sup>), high safety derived from the nondendritic behavior of deposited magnesium, and the high abundance of magnesium metal compared with that of lithium

Although various electrolytes have been developed for magnesium batteries by several pioneering researchers, they require further improvement for practical application
