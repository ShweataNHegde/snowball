   <sub>3</sub>COMgCl- (blue), Ph
   <sub>3</sub>SiOMgCl- (red), and B(OMgCl)
   <sub>3</sub>-based (green) electrolytes at the 100
   <sup>th</sup> cycle. Measurements were taken at a scan rate of 5 mV/s at 20 °C using Pt, Mg, and Mg as the working, reference, and counter electrodes, respectively, in a three-electrode cell. (

   <sub>3</sub>COMgCl- (blue), Ph
   <sub>3</sub>SiOMgCl- (red), and B(OMgCl)
   <sub>3</sub>-based (green) electrolytes at a scan rate of 5 mV/s at 20 °C. (
   <bold>c</bold>) Cyclic voltammograms at the 100
   <sup>th</sup> cycle measured at a scan rate of 5 mV/s at 20 °C. The blue and red curves represent the first measurement and measurement after three weeks, respectively, for the Ph
   <sub>3</sub>COMgCl-based electrolyte. The green and purple curves represent the first measurement and measurement after three weeks, respectively, for the Ph
   <sub>3</sub>SiOMgCl-based electrolyte. (

   <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra of the Ph
   <sub>3</sub>COMgCl-based electrolyte as prepared (blue) and three weeks after preparation (red) and Ph
   <sub>3</sub>SiOMgCl-based electrolyte as prepared (green) and three weeks after preparation (purple).
