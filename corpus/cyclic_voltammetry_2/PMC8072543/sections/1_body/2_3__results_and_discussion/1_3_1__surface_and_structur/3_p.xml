<p>As seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01025-f002">Figure 2</xref>A, a short-range interaction of the hysteresis loop was observed, and the desorption curve was suddenly dropped at 0.46 P/P
 <sub>o</sub>, which indicates that the lowest number of pores may occur in LCFM(5555)-no gly. It is also evidenced from the pore-size distribution curve of LCFM(5555)-no gly (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01025-f002">Figure 2</xref>D), which shows the pore size and pore volume of about 4.7 nm and 0.034 m
 <sup>3</sup> g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. The pore size and pore volume are significantly enhanced to approximately 8.1 nm and 0.061 m
 <sup>3</sup> g
 <sup>−1</sup> for the LCFM(5555)-gly sample (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01025-f002">Figure 2</xref>E), which is due to the multi-structure morphology of microspheres and microplates of LCFM(5555)-gly and CeO
 <sub>2</sub>, respectively. On the other hand, the pore size of LCFM(8255)-gly is reduced to 6.3 nm, and the pore volume is increased to approximately 0.071 m
 <sup>3</sup> g
 <sup>−1</sup>, which confirms the residue of CeO
 <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles may be positioned onto the pores of the LCFM(8255)-gly microsphere particles (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01025-f002">Figure 2</xref>F). The obtained specific surface area (38.38 m
 <sup>2</sup> g
 <sup>−1</sup>) of LCFM(8255)-gly perovskite is much higher than the previously reported LaMnO
 <sub>3</sub> perovskites [

 <xref rid="B23-nanomaterials-11-01025" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-nanomaterials-11-01025" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,

 <xref rid="B29-nanomaterials-11-01025" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Thus, the existence of a large number of pores in LCFM(8255)-gly microspheres can provide support for the efficient diffusion of electrolyte ions and O
 <sub>2</sub> gas in both O
 <sub>2</sub> electrocatalysis and Li-O
 <sub>2</sub> battery performance.
