 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01025-f003">Figure 3</xref>D,E displays the deconvoluted spectra of Fe 2p and Mn 2p peaks, wherein the SOS of 2p
 <sub>3/2</sub> and 2p
 <sub>1/2</sub> are separated by 13.1 and 11.8 eV for Fe and Mn, respectively. The high-intensity peaks at 713.7 and 644.2 eV in Fe 2p
 <sub>3/2</sub> and Mn 2p
 <sub>3/2</sub> are corresponding to the +3 oxidation state of Fe and Mn elements in the LCFM(8255)-gly sample. In Mn 2p
 <sub>3/2</sub>, two doublet peaks were observed for the co-existence of the mixed oxidation state of Mn
 <sup>3+</sup> and Mn
 <sup>4+</sup>. Several Mn
 <sup>3+</sup> can be oxidized into Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> while doping with other elements on the B site; however, the high intensity of Mn
 <sup>3+</sup> indicates that the main component is present in the form of +3 in composite [

 <sup>4+</sup>/Mn
 <sup>3+</sup> was calculated as 0.68, and it was obtained from the peak area of Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> and Mn
 <sup>3+</sup>. Furthermore, the core-level spectrum of O 1s peak (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01025-f003">Figure 3</xref>F) is deconvoluted into four peaks wherein the peaks at 530.4 and 532.2 eV are corresponding to the lattice O

 <sup>2−</sup>) and surface-level adsorbed oxygen species O
 <sub>sur.</sub> (O
 <sup>−</sup>, O
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>−</sup> or O
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>2−</sup>). The ratio of O
 <sub>lat.</sub>/O
 <sub>total</sub> is approximately 0.27, which confirms the presence of oxygen vacancies. Moreover, the high intensity of the O
 <sub>sur.</sub> peak indicates the stronger covalence of the B-O bond, which favors the O
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>/OH
 <sup>−</sup> exchange. The obtained results suggest that the doping of Ce and Fe in LaMnO
 <sub>3</sub> perovskite structures can increase the Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> generation and oxygen vacancies, which will improve the kinetics of ORR and OER performance [
