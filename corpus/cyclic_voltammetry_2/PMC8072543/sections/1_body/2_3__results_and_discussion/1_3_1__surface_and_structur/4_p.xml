<p>The XPS analysis further confirmed the presence of elements in the as-synthesized LCFM(8255)-gly perovskite catalyst. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01025-f003">Figure 3</xref>A shows the wide-scan XPS curve of LCFM(8255)-gly perovskite sample, which confirmed the presence of La, Ce, Fe, Mn and O elements. The narrow-scan XPS curves of these elements were further fitted by the Gaussian–Lorentzian (G-L) method (30% of G-L ratio) by using XPSPEAK 4.1 software. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01025-f003">Figure 3</xref>B shows the high-resolution La 3d XPS curve wherein the spin–orbit splitting (SOS) of 3d
 <sub>5/2</sub> and 3d
 <sub>3/2</sub> are separated with 16.8 eV. The multiplet at 3d
 <sub>5/2</sub> is also separated by 4.2 eV, indicating the +3 oxidation state of lanthanum elements. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01025-f003">Figure 3</xref>C, eight peaks appeared for Ce 3d with an SOS of 18.6 eV. The doublet peaks at 885.6 eV (3d
 <sub>5/2</sub>) and 904.2 eV (3d
 <sub>3/2</sub>) belong to the Ce
 <sup>3+</sup> state, whereas the other three doublet peaks at 883.7/902.3, 891.9/910.5 and 900.8/919.4 eV are related to the Ce
 <sup>4+</sup> oxidation state [
