<p>The surface area and pore-size distribution of the as-prepared perovskites were studied by using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01025-f002">Figure 2</xref>A–C shows the N
 <sub>2</sub> adsorption–desorption isotherm curves of LCFM(5555)-no gly, LCFM(5555)-gly and LCFM(8255)-gly samples. All the samples are followed the Type IV adsorption isotherm with an H
 <sub>2</sub> hysteresis loop. The hysteresis loop at the relative pressure range from 0.4 to 1.0 P/P
 <sub>o</sub> is attributed to the mesoporous nature of the sample. Hence, the LCFM(5555)-gly and LCFM(8255)-gly samples are exposed high specific surface areas of 23.81 and 38.38 m
 <sup>2</sup> g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively, as compared to the LCFM(5555)-no gly (1.69 m
 <sup>2</sup> g
 <sup>−1</sup>).
