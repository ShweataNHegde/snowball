<p>Glycine-assisted hydrothermal synthesis was performed to obtain the Ce- and Fe-co-doped LaMnO
 <sub>3</sub> perovskites, such as LCFM(5555) and LCFM(8255), for energy conversion and storage application. The surface morphology of the as-prepared perovskite samples was investigated by SEM analysis, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01025-f001">Figure 1</xref>A–C. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01025-f001">Figure 1</xref>A exhibits the SEM image of LCFM(5555)-no gly, which reveals non-uniform particle growth during the hydrothermal reaction. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01025-f001">Figure 1</xref>B shows the multi-shape morphology with a microscale that consists of LCFM(5555)-gly microspheres and CeO
 <sub>2</sub> microplate-like structure. The microspheres of perovskite may form due to the efficient chelation chemistry between metal ions and the glycine metal–organic complex. These metal–organic frameworks can favor mesopore formation on the perovskite catalyst surface under the high-temperature calcination process. On the other hand, the high mol% of Ce doping can initiate the growth of aggregated CeO
 <sub>2</sub> microstructures, resulting in lower electrochemical activity than the nanoparticles of CeO
 <sub>2</sub>. Therefore, we reduced the mol% of Ce to 0.2 to obtain the LCFM(8255) perovskite catalyst. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01025-f001">Figure 1</xref>C clearly reveals the uniform LCFM(8255) microspheres with the co-existence of CeO
 <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles. The crystallinity of these synthesized samples was also evaluated by XRD analysis. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01025-f001">Figure 1</xref>D displays the XRD patterns of (a) LCFM(5555)-no gly, (b) LCFM(5555)-gly and (c) LCFM(8255)-gly. The planes are clearly indexed to partially doped LaMnO
 <sub>3</sub> perovskite with rhombohedral crystal planes (JCPDS no. 89-8775) and a space group of R-3C. All three patterns showed the co-existence of cubic CeO
 <sub>2</sub> phase (JCPDS no. 04-0593) with a significantly decreasing intensity of (111), (220) and (311) planes related to reducing the mol% of Ce doping. However, the addition of glycine can stabilize particle growth and improve the crystallinity of (b) LCFM(5555)-gly and (c) LCFM(8255)-gly samples, as compared to LCFM(5555)-no gly. In addition, the crystallite sizes of these samples were calculated using the Scherrer equation on the (110) plane; the derived values were 7.5, 16.7 and 10.1 nm for (a) LCFM(5555)-no gly, (b) LCFM(5555)-gly and (c) LCFM(8255)-gly, respectively.
