<p>In this work, the as-synthesized LCFM(8255)-gly microsphere sample was combined with GNS to improve the electrochemical properties. The composite catalyst was already denoted as LCFM(8255)-gly/GNS. The integration of GNS with LCFM(8255)-gly microspheres is clearly characterized by TEM, XRD and micro-Raman spectroscopy analyses.
