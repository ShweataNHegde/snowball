 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01025-f004">Figure 4</xref>E depicts the XRD patterns of (a) LCFM(8255)-gly, (b) GNS and (c) LCFM(8255)-gly/GNS composite catalysts, which confirms the existence of (002) and (100) planes of GNS in the composite sample. The crystallinity of LCFM(8255)-gly sample was clearly discussed in the previous section. However, the diffraction peak of the (002) plane of GNS has shifted to a lower angle in the LCFM(8255)-gly/GNS composite sample, which indicates the disorder of graphene sheets by the interaction with LCFM(8255)-gly particles. Moreover, the disordered properties are further confirmed by micro-Raman spectra (

 <sup>−1</sup> for the LCFM(8255)-gly/GNS composite (

The D/G intensity ratios of GNS and LCFM(8255)-gly/GNS composite catalysts are calculated to ca. 0.98 and 1.0, respectively. These results indicate that the disordered graphene layer is possible in a composite sample and that the basal plane of GNS can be attached strongly to the perovskite microsphere particles that renders more uniform coverage on the surface of the particle. In addition, our micro-Raman spectra also reveal that the presence of LCFM(8255)-gly particles by the appearance of peaks at 264, 476 and 592 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> are related to the rotational (A
 <sub>g</sub>) and Jahn–Teller stretching (A
 <sub>g</sub>, B
 <sub>2g</sub>) modes of the rhombohedrally distorted LaMnO
 <sub>3</sub> perovskite, respectively [
