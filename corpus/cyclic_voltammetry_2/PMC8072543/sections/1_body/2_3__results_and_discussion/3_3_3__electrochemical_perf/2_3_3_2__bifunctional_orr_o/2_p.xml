<p>Prior to use these catalysts as Li-O

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01025-f006">Figure 6</xref>B shows the CVs of ORR and OER activity of (a) GNS, (b) LCFM(5555)-gly/GNS, and (c) LCFM(8255)-gly/GNS-based cathodes in O

It is clearly indicated that the LCFM(8255)-gly/GNS composite cathode shows much lower onset overpotential and high peak current density than the GNS and LCFM(5555)-gly/GNS electrodes. This superior ORR and OER activity can be achieved due to the intrinsic electronic conductivity of LCFM(8255)-gly/GNS composite catalyst materials. The Nyquist plot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01025-f006">Figure 6</xref>C) of EIS data were taken to evaluate the charge transfer properties of the (a) GNS, (b) LCFM(5555)-gly/GNS and (c) LCFM(8255)-gly/GNS cathodes. The inset of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01025-f006">Figure 6</xref>C shows the equivalent-circuit model for the fitting of the Nyquist plots. It was found that the lower charge transfer impedance can be observed at LCFM(8255)-gly/GNS cathodes, as compared to GNS and LCFM(5555)-gly/GNS. As noted, the charge transfer characteristics of perovskite and graphene composite are significantly improved due to the interaction between the redox-active perovskite structure and conductive graphene support.
