<p>To further evaluate the bifunctional characteristics, LSV polarization curves were obtained using (a) 20 wt.% Pt/C, (b) LCFM(8255)-gly/GNS, (c) LCFM(5555)-gly/GNS and (d). GNS electrodes in O
 <sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-01025-f006">Figure 6</xref>A). The total overpotential difference (ΔE = E
 <sub>OER</sub> − E
 <sub>ORR</sub>) between ORR and OER curves of those electrodes was measured at 0.5 and 1 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup>, respectively. The ΔE value of LCFM(8255)-gly/GNS composite electrode is ca. 0.94 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which is very close to the 20 wt.% Pt/C (at 0.92 V vs. Ag/AgCl) and lower than the LCFM(5555)-gly/GNS (at 1.02 V vs. Ag/AgCl) and bare GNS (at 1.06 V vs. Ag/AgCl) electrodes. Hence, the results revealed that the LCFM(8255)-gly/GNS composite electrode is a superior bifunctional catalyst, which can be used as a cathode in Li-O
 <sub>2</sub> battery application instead of a conventional Pt/C catalyst and other carbon-based cathodes.
