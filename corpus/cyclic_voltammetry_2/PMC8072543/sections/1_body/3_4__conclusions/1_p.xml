<p>A simple synthesis methodology has been developed for synthesizing a highly porous, high-surface-area A-site- and B-site-doped LaMnO
 <sub>3</sub> perovskite. XRD analysis confirmed the distorted rhombohedral crystal structure for this perovskite is due to Ce
 <sup>3+</sup> and Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> cation doping, respectively. The CV results confirmed that the LCFM(8255)-gly/GNS composite electrode shows better ORR onset potential and peak current density than the bare LCFM(8255)-gly and LCFM(5555)-gly/GNS composite electrodes. The electrochemical ORR/OER kinetics of the proposed catalyst can be significantly improved by incorporating conductive GNS as support and reducing the mol% of Ce ion doping on the A site. Furthermore, the effect of dual cation doping on the LaMnO
 <sub>3</sub> structure increases the ratio of Mn
 <sup>4+</sup>/Mn
 <sup>3+</sup> species and generates more oxygen vacancies on the perovskite crystal structure. Finally, the as-developed LCFM(8255)-gly/GNS composite catalyst achieved efficient bifunctional activity comparable to commercial Pt/C catalysts. Therefore, the proposed synthesis method can derive low-cost and highly active perovskite materials, including a large-surface-area and highly porous structure, as the air cathode for energy storage and conversion applications.
