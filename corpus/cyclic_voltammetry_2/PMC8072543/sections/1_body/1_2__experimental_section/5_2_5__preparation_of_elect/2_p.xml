<p>To prepare the oxygen cathode for Li-O
 <sub>2</sub> battery application, a slurry was prepared by mixing the as-prepared catalyst samples, Ketjen black and PVDF in N-methyl pyrrolidone at a weight ratio of 80:10:10 and continuously stirred for 12 h at 25 °C to form a homogeneous mixture. Then, the catalyst mixture slurry was spray-coated (Sono-Tek Corporation, Milton, NY, USA) on both sides of the Ni-foam (2 × 2 cm
 <sup>2</sup>) matrix with a flow rate of 2 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup> and dried at 120 °C for 12 h. Finally, the catalyst-coated Ni-foam electrodes were prepared as disks (diameter = 1.3 cm
 <sup>2</sup>) for cell assembly. The catalyst loading of each electrode was approximately 1 mg cm
 <sup>−2</sup>. EL-CELL was assembled in an Ar-filled glovebox environment (H
 <sub>2</sub>O &lt; 0.5 ppm; O
 <sub>2</sub> &lt; 0.5 ppm) to evaluate the oxygen electrocatalyst’s performance toward Li-O
 <sub>2</sub> battery application. Here, the as-prepared composite electrodes were used as a cathode, Li foil as an anode and commercial glass fiber (Whatman; thickness ~260 µm) as a separator for cell preparation. A 1 M Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide-Tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (LiTFSI-TEGDME)-based electrolyte was used with 0.5 M LiI as an additive. All the cells were tested at the potential cut-off range of 2.0–4.5 V vs. Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup> at 100 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup> using the Arbin BT2000 battery test system (Arbin Instruments, College Station, TX, USA). For all these cells, the oxygen supply was passed (10 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>) through a thin microtube (diameter &lt;1 mm) using pure O
 <sub>2</sub> (99.999%) at 1 atm.
