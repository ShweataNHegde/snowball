<p>In order to prepare the oxygen electrode to evaluate the bifunctional activity of the oxide catalyst, the as-prepared composite catalyst (10 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) was dispersed in a 1:3 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic> ratio DI water to isopropanol solvent mixture containing 80 µL of Nafion (5 wt.%) binder solution. This mixture was ultrasonicated (ultrasonic cleaner: DC300H; frequency −40 kHz; max. output power −300 W) for 1 h to develop a homogeneous catalyst ink. Then, about 20 µL of the catalyst ink was drop-coated onto the RDE (Geometric area = 0.196 cm
 <sup>2</sup>) surface and dried at 50 °C for 30 min. The as-modified RDE was used to further evaluate the bifunctional (ORR/OER) activity of the catalyst in a 0.1 M KOH electrolyte.
