<p>The probe sonication method was employed to prepare the GNS-wrapped LCFM(8255)-gly composite materials (designated as LCFM(8255)-gly/GNS). Briefly, 0.7 g of GNS powder was first dispersed in 100 mL ethanol and sonicated using a probe sonicator for 1 h. The probe sonicator was operated at 5 mV amplitude with a 20 min pulse-on and 5 min pulse-off procedure for 1 h. During the process, the probe sonicator’s output power and frequency were maintained at 2–4 W and 20 kHz, respectively. Then, about 0.3 g of the as-prepared LCFM(8255)-gly perovskite catalyst was added into the ethanolic GNS solution, followed by probe sonication for 1 h under the same conditions. Finally, the mixture was dried at 60 °C in an air oven; after this, the dried LCFM(8255)-gly/GNS composite catalyst could be used for further analysis, as depicted in
