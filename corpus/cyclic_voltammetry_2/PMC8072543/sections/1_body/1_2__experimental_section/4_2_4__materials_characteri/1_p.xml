<p>Morphology and crystallinity of the synthesized materials were characterized by SEM (Hitachi-S2600, Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and XRD (Bruker D2 PHASER, Karlsruhe, Germany) analysis. TEM (JEM-2100, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) equipment was used to confirm the morphology as well as the GNS layer on the perovskite microsphere particles. N
 <sub>2</sub> adsorption–desorption isotherm analysis (Micromeritics, Gemini VII, Monchegladbach, Germany) was carried out to examine the materials’ surface area and porous nature. XPS (VG Scientific ESCALAB 250, Thermo Fisher, CA, USA) analysis was used to characterize the valence state of elements present in the composite samples. A three-electrode configuration for oxygen electrocatalysis study was employed using a CHI405 potentiostat (CHI Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) with a catalyst-modified rotating disk electrode (RDE) as working electrode, Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl) as reference electrode, and Pt wire as the counter electrode. Cyclic voltammetry (potential range = 2.0 to 4.5 V vs. Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup>; scan rate = 1 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup>) and AC impedance (frequency range = 1 MHz to 0.01 Hz; amplitude = 5 mV) analysis for two-electrode systems were performed using an Autolab PGSTAT30 (Metrohm Autolab B.V., Houten, The Netherlands).
