 <sub>3</sub> perovskite oxides were prepared via a hydrothermal synthesis method using a glycine–nitrate complex mixture as the precursor material. In brief, stoichiometric amounts of nitrates of La, Ce, Fe and Mn precursors were separately dissolved in de-ionized water (each in 50 mL) and mixed together with constant stirring by a magnetic stirrer for 15 min. Then, a 0.3 M aqueous glycine solution was added dropwise into the mixed precursor solution. The color of the solution changed from pale orange to red-orange, indicating the formation of a glycine–metal nitrate complex. Then, the final solution pH was adjusted to around 8.0–9.0 by 1 M NH
 <sub>4</sub>OH aqueous solution and stirred for 1 h at 25 °C. Finally, the mixed solution was poured into a 350 mL Teflon-lined autoclave for hydrothermal treatment at 180 °C for 6 h. After the temperature cooled down to 25 °C, the product was centrifuged and washed with deionized (DI) water and ethanol several times, and the collected residue was dried at 80 °C overnight. The dried powder was ground well, transferred into an alumina boat and kept inside a muffle furnace for calcination. The final powder was collected after calcining at 800 °C for 3 h in an air atmosphere, as depicted in
