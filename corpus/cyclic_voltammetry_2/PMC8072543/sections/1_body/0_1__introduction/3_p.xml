<p>In this study, a catalyst based on cerium- (Ce) and iron (Fe)-co-doped LaMnO
 <sub>3</sub> perovskite was prepared by the hydrothermal synthesis route. Glycine was used as a reducing and pore-generating agent in this process, resulting in mesoporous and large-surface-area perovskite material. Interestingly, the morphology of the particles was changed due to the addition of glycine. Moreover, the catalyst’s activity was improved by changing the mole ratio of Ce dopant in the La
