consideration in the development of a superior electrocatalyst for improving the kinetics of oxygen electrode reactions, such as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in Li-O<sub>2</sub> battery application. Herein, we demonstrate a glycine-assisted hydrothermal and probe sonication method for the synthesis of a mesoporous spherical La<sub>0.8</sub>Ce<sub>0.2</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>0.5</sub>O<sub>3</sub> perovskite particle and embedded graphene nanosheet (LCFM(8255)-gly/GNS) composite and evaluate its bifunctional ORR/OER kinetics in Li-O<sub>2</sub> battery application. The physicochemical characterization confirms that the as-formed LCFM(8255)-gly perovskite catalyst has a highly crystalline structure and mesoporous morphology with a large specific surface area. The LCFM(8255)-gly/GNS composite hybrid structure exhibits an improved onset potential and high current density toward ORR/OER in both aqueous and non-aqueous electrolytes. The LCFM(8255)-gly/GNS composite cathode (ca. 8475 mAh g<sup>-1</sup>) delivers a higher discharge capacity than the La<sub>0.5</sub>Ce<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>0.5</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-gly/GNS cathode (ca. 5796 mAh g<sup>-1</sup>) in a Li-O<sub>2</sub> battery at a current density of 100 mA g<sup>-1</sup>. Our results revealed that the composite's high electrochemical activity comes from the synergism of highly abundant oxygen vacancies and redox-active sites due to the Ce and Fe dopant in LaMnO<sub>3</sub> and the excellent charge transfer characteristics of the graphene materials.
