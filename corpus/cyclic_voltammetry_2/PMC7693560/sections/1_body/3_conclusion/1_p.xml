<p>In conclusion, Ni
 <sub>3</sub>Fe
 <sub>2</sub>@NC/CC integrated electrode was prepared by uniformly loading nickel-iron bimetallic nanoparticles on nitrogen-doped carbon nanostructures grown on carbon cloth support by chemical precipitation and then high-temperature calcination. The preparation technology of the integrated electrode with the catalyst uniformly supported on the conductive carrier is simple, and the electrode presents high catalytic activity and good stability. The prepared Ni
 <sub>3</sub>Fe
 <sub>2</sub>@NC/CC shows enhanced OER/ORR activity and durability either in electrochemical half-reaction tests or reversible zinc-air batteries, which is superior to noble metals and many previously developed electrocatalysts. Further experimental analysis demonstrates the advantages of 
 <italic>in-situ</italic> integrated electrode in facilitating the electrode transfer and strong interaction between the active materials and the current collector, thereby promoting the electrocatalytic performance. Our findings provide a simple strategy for the preparation of bimetallic nanocomposites and open up a new way for the development of promising hybrid catalysts for electrochemical and energy-related applications.
