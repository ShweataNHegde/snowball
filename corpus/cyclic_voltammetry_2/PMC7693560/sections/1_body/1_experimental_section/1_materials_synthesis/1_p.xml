<p>In a typical synthetic procedure, potassium hexamethylene ferrite (1.33 g) was put in a 200 mL beaker, and then added in 100 mL deionized water and pre-treated carbon cloths to form settled solution A. In the meantime, nickel nitrate hexahydrate (1.74 g) and trisodium citrate (2.36 g) were dissolved into 200 mL water to form clear solution B. Solution A and solution B were mixed under strong magnetic stirring to form a homogeneous solution. After 24 h standing and ripening, NiFe-MOFs coated carbon cloths were taken out to dry at room temperature. At the same time, the solution was centrifuged to obtain the solid, washed with water and ethanol for three times, and then dried at room temperature to achieve the NiFe-MOFs powder. The NiFe-MOFs carbon cloths and powders were transferred into the porcelain boat. And then, the boat was placed in a tube furnace, heated to 500°C with a slow heating rate of 2°C min
 <sup>−1</sup> under Ar atmosphere and kept for 1 h. After the temperature was naturally down to room temperature, the obtained integrated electrode and powder sample were collected and signed as Ni
 <sub>3</sub>Fe
 <sub>2</sub>@NC/CC and Ni
 <sub>3</sub>Fe
 <sub>2</sub>@NC, respectively.
