<p>The flexible semi-solid zinc-air battery was composed of a zinc anode, a Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) KOH solid electrolyte, and Ni
 <sub>3</sub>Fe
 <sub>2</sub>@NC/CC air cathode. The preparation method of the PVA-KOH electrolyte was shown below. Dissolve 3 g of PVA powder in 25 mL of deionized water and stir thoroughly at 90 °C to form a clear solution. Then add 6 mL 9 M KOH solution to mix, continue to stir at 90°C for 4 h, then put in the refrigerator to freeze for at least 3 h.
