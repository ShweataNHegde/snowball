<p>The phase and crystal structure were characterized by an X-ray diffraction analyzer (XRD, Bruker D8 Advanced, CuKÎ± radiation). Scanning electron microscope (SEM, s4800 Hitachi, 30 kV) with energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F, 200 kV) and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF-STEM, JEM-ARM200F, 200 kV) were used to observe the microstructure and nanostructure of samples. The chemical valence and surface composition were detected by Thermo Scientific X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Escalab 250Xi).</p>
