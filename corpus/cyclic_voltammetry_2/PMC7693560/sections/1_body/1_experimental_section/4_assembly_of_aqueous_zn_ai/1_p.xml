<p>The aqueous zinc-air battery was constructed by the anode, the cathode, and the electrolyte. The anode of the battery was a zinc plate, the electrolyte was 6.0 M KOH and 0.2 M ZnCl
 <sub>2</sub> solution, and the air cathode was a catalyst coated on a 1 Ã— 1 cm
 <sup>2</sup> carbon cloth. The integrated electrode obtained in this work was directly used as an air cathode. Before testing, high-purity oxygen must be allowed to enter the electrolyte for about 20 min to reach the oxygen saturation state. During the test, oxygen should be continuously introduced at a small flow rate to ensure oxygen saturation of the electrolyte. The open-circuit voltage and reversible cycle of the zinc-air battery were tested by the LAND-CT2001A testing device.
