<p>The synergistic effect between different metals in bimetallic materials can effectively change the electronic structure of materials and reduce the free energy of reaction, leading to the effective bifunctional capability (Su et al., 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Besides, rational design of catalytic electrode structure is an important approach to improve the electrochemical performance. The traditional electrode preparation process is to disperse the powdered catalyst in a solvent and prepare an electrode slurry, which is then coated on carbon cloth or carbon paper to prepare the final air cathode. The preparation method not only makes the catalyst loaded on the support non-uniform, but also causes the weak interaction between the functional phase and the support, resulting in poor electrode stability. Moreover, the binder added in the preparation of electrode slurry will cover the catalytic active site and increase the interfacial resistance, unfavorable for the activity enhancement.
