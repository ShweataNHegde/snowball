<p>In this work, a novel NiFe nanoparticles supported on nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) hybrid material, directly grown on the carbon cloth (designated as Ni
 <sub>3</sub>Fe
 <sub>2</sub>@NC/CC), was proposed and synthesized as an integrated electrode for promoting OER/ORR electrocatalysis and zinc-air batteries. The designed synthetic strategy includes a chemical precipitation method and then a one-step pyrolysis procedure. Compared with the traditional electrode in which Ni
 <sub>3</sub>Fe
 <sub>2</sub>@NC is prepared as an electrode slurry drop-coated on carbon cloth, the Ni
 <sub>3</sub>Fe
 <sub>2</sub>@NC/CC integrated electrode exhibits greatly improved catalytic activity. When the anodic current density reaches 10 mA cm
 <sup>âˆ’2</sup>, the OER overpotential is 238 mV, which is lower than the Ni
 <sub>3</sub>Fe
 <sub>2</sub>@NC drop coating electrode (340 mV) and the precious metal oxide IrO
 <sub>2</sub> (400 mV). The Ni
 <sub>3</sub>Fe
 <sub>2</sub>@NC/CC also exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic durability. It can be directly used as the positive electrode for practical aqueous and flexible semi-solid zinc-air batteries, which deliver large discharging capacity, more than 80 discharging-charging cycles and good flexibility.
