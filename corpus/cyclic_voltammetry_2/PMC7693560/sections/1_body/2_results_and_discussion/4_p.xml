<p>A home-made liquid zinc-air battery was constructed to evaluate the practical electrochemical performance of Ni
 <sub>3</sub>Fe
 <sub>2</sub>@NC/CC, in which a zinc plate was served as the anode, the Ni
 <sub>3</sub>Fe
 <sub>2</sub>@NC/CC integrated electrode as the air cathode, and 6.0 M KOH and 0.2 M ZnCl
 <sub>2</sub> as the electrolyte (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). The alkaline zinc-air batteries based on Ni
 <sub>3</sub>Fe
 <sub>2</sub>@NC/CC materials exhibit a steady open-circuit voltage of 1.45 V (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). In addition, with the current density of 5 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup> and the duration of each cycle of 20 min, the cycle chargeability of the secondary battery was further studied (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). It is worth noting that under the catalysis of Ni
 <sub>3</sub>Fe
 <sub>2</sub>@NC/CC electrode, the discharge voltage of the battery is 1.11 V, the charging voltage is 1.95 V, the voltage gap is 0.84 V, and the energy efficiency is 56.9%. Small voltage decay is observed after 80 cycles for Ni
 <sub>3</sub>Fe
 <sub>2</sub>@NC/CC cathode, which reflects the excellent rechargeability and is much better than the precious metal Pt/C-IrO
 <sub>2</sub> catalyst (&lt;50 cycles). The discharge specific capacity of a primary Zinc-air battery with Ni
 <sub>3</sub>Fe
 <sub>2</sub>@NC/CC cathode is 655 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 20 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup> based on the mass of consumed zinc (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>). Encouraged by the potential application for portable and wearable devices, a flexible solid-state zinc-air battery was assembled with zinc plate anode, PVA-KOH electrolyte and Ni
 <sub>3</sub>Fe
 <sub>2</sub>@NC/CC integrated cathode. The open circuit voltage of solid zinc-air battery promoted by Ni
 <sub>3</sub>Fe
 <sub>2</sub>@NC/CC can reach 1.37 V, again indicating the efficient ORR activity of the integrated cathode (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref> inset, a light emitting diode (LED) screen was powered by two Ni
 <sub>3</sub>Fe
 <sub>2</sub>@NC/CC-based solid flexible Zinc-air batteries in series. The voltage-current polarization curves revealed that the Ni
 <sub>3</sub>Fe
 <sub>2</sub>@NC/CC cathode possessed a good charge-discharge performance (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). The discharge voltage at 10 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup> is 1.09 V and the charge voltage is 2.08 V when the battery is flat. Moreover, the battery exhibits considerable flexibility. When the assembled battery is bent about 30°, the polarization curve shows that the discharge voltage is 1.07 V at a current density of 10 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup>, which is only 1.8% lower than the discharge voltage in the flat state of the battery, and the charging voltage is 2.20 V, which is 5.7% higher. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>, the assembled battery can be alternately flat and bent (once every 5 charge-discharge cycles). Under a large mechanical strain, the battery can maintain a good charge and discharge cycle under continuous charging and discharging conditions. These results fully prove the good flexibility and cycle stability of Ni
 <sub>3</sub>Fe
 <sub>2</sub>@NC/CC-based rechargeable zinc-air batteries.
