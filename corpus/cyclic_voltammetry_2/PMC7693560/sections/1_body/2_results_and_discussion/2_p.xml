<p>X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to characterize the chemical states and surface structure of Ni

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The N 1s spectrum was deconvoluted into three peaks, which can be assigned to pyridinic N (398.5 eV), pyrrolic N (400.2 eV), and N-O (403.5 eV) (

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2019b</xref>). However, it is worth noting that pyridinic N can bond with metal atoms. The existence of C=N and C-N bond indicated the successful doping of N into the carbon skeleton. The two peaks at 852.8 and 855.2 eV in Ni 2p spectrum were ascribed to Ni 2p

The peaks in the Fe 2p spectrum included two peaks of zero-valence state (707.1 and 720.2 eV) and two peaks of high valence state (711.1 and 724.2 eV) with two peaks of shakeup satellites (716.3 and 733.2 eV), which were derived from NiFe nanoparticle and Fe-N species (
