 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). After calcination at 773 K under an argon atmosphere, the organic precursors were carbonized into NC and the nanoparticles were anchored on the NC matrix. XRD analysis of the resultant composites elucidated that the dominant phase was bimetal NiFe with three obvious diffraction peaks at 44, 51, and 75°, which can be assigned, respectively, to the (111), (200), and (220) planes of NiFe alloy (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>). Energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) showed that the atomic ratio of Ni and Fe in the calcined sample was 3:2 (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Comprehensive analysis of XRD and EDS data demonstrates the successful synthesis of nickel-iron nanoparticles on the N-doped carbon nanocube structure. Furthermore, as shown in

 <sub>2</sub>@NC nanoparticles evenly loaded on the carbon cloth with the average particle size of ~100 nm. For further structural analysis of nanoparticles on carbon cloth, put the calcined integrated electrode in absolute ethanol and sonicate, and the dissolving sample was taken to perform TEM test. TEM further confirms the nanoparticles with the size of about 100 nm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>). The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image proved distinct domains of NiFe alloy with the interplanar spacing of 0.20 and 0.17 nm, corresponding to the (111) and (200) facets of NiFe alloy, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>). To further characterize the NiFe alloy, an aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF-STEM) test was performed on it. The HAADF-STEM image showed NiFe alloy with a heavier element mass on an NC substrate exists in the form of bright spots, and the particle size of the NiFe alloys is about 2 ~ 3 nm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2f</xref>). Also, elemental mapping of Ni

 <sub>2</sub>@NC revealed the homogeneous dispersion of C, N, Ni, and Fe species throughout the entire nanoarchitecture (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2g</xref>), suggesting the uniform loading of NiFe nanoparticles on N-doped carbon structure.
