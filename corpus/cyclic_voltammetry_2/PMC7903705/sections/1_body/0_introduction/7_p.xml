<p>Optimization of the composition of LiBH
 <sub>4</sub>-based composites as an SSE can reduce the working temperature of the LiBH
 <sub>4</sub>-based SSBs. Therefore, the aim of this work is to design a LiBH
 <sub>4</sub>-based system as an improved SSE for RT SSBs. The LiBH
 <sub>4</sub>–MgO system was selected, and the effect of the composition on the Li-ion conductivity was first established. The electrochemical stability window, measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV), was then determined in order to investigate the effect of the oxide matrix on the electrochemical stability of LiBH
 <sub>4</sub>. A solid-state cell configuration, that is, TiS
 <sub>2</sub>|SSE|Li, was selected as the electrochemical system, focusing on the characterization of the composite LiBH
 <sub>4</sub>–MgO as the SSE for SSBs. These composites allowed to decrease the operating temperature of the LiBH
 <sub>4</sub>-based SSB down to 60 °C and even down to RT, compared to the 120 °C of pure LiBH
 <sub>4</sub>. Several cycles at 60 °C, and probably the concomitant formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase, allowed us to successfully operate the SSB at RT for more than 30 cycles, with a discharge capacity retention of 80%.
