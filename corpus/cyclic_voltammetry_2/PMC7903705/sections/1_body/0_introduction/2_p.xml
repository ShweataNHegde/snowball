<p>Li-ion batteries (LIBs) are widely used in portable devices and play a major role in the fast-growing electro-mobility market. Solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) are promising candidates for resolving the intrinsic limitations of the organic liquid electrolyte currently employed in LIBs, such as the low cation transference number, the incompatibility (due to the uneven Li plating resulting in shortcuts) and reactivity with lithium metal anodes, and flammability.

 </sup> Such drawbacks limit the cell energy density and require major safety precautions. SSEs can overcome these hindrances or bottleneck limitations, thanks to their intrinsic stiffness, which makes them less prone to dendrite penetration.

 </sup> Moreover, superior chemical stability allows the use of metallic lithium as a negative electrode.

 </sup> The improved safety naturally comes from the solid nature of the electrolyte. An SSE must fulfill several requirements to be employed in an all-solid-state battery (SSB), such as a Li-ion conductivity higher than 10
 <sup>–3</sup> S cm
 <sup>–1</sup> at room temperature (RT), a negligible electronic conductivity, and a wide electrochemical stability window.
