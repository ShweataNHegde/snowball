<p>The Li-ion conductivity in the LiBH
 <sub>4</sub>â€“MgO system has been evaluated for different compositions following the procedure suggested in ref (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>). Three samples were synthetized, with a v/v % of MgO corresponding to a fraction of pore filling equal to 1/3, 1, and 3 (CE26, CE53, and CE74, respectively) assuming that LiBH
 <sub>4</sub> fills the pores of MgO after ball milling. LiBH
 <sub>4</sub> (purity &gt; 95%, Alfa Aesar) was mixed with MgO (Steam Chemicals) in different ratios (
