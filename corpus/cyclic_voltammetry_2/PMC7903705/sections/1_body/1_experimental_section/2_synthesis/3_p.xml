<p>In order to remove the physisorbed/chemisorbed water, MgO pellets were dried in a furnace for 6 h, under dynamic vacuum (by rotary pump), at 300 °C. Before the mechanochemical treatment for the preparation of the different compositions, the as-received LiBH
 <sub>4</sub> was ball-milled for 2 h at 500 rpm in a Fritsch Pulverisette 7 planetary mill and was used as the starting material for the LiBH
 <sub>4</sub>–oxide composite. All samples were ball-milled for three periods of 10 min at 300 rpm, separated by 1 min breaks, in 80 mL stainless-steel vials, with stainless-steel spheres (10 mm diameter). The ball-to-sample mass ratio used was equal to 30:1. The mechanochemical treatment was performed under an argon atmosphere for all samples. Due to the air sensitivity of the samples, they have been manipulated in a glovebox (MBraun Lab Star Glove Box) filled with argon, with residual impurities (&lt;1 ppm O
 <sub>2</sub> and &lt;1 ppm H
 <sub>2</sub>O).
