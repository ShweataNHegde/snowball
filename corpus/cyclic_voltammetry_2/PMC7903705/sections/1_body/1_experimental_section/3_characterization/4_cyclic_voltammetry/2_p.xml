<p>CV was used to analyze the oxidative limit of the electrochemical stability window. The desired LiBH
 <sub>4</sub>–MgO composite was mixed with carbon black (CB, Ketjenblack EC600JD, Akzo Nobel Chemicals) in a weight ratio of 95:5 using an agate mortar.

 </sup> A two-layered pellet was obtained by pressing the 8 mg CE-composite mixture and about 25 mg of the composite at 240 MPa using a uniaxial hydraulic press (diameter 6 mm). The pellet thus prepared was tested in a two-electrode 3/4″ PTFE Swagelok-type cell, with a lithium disk (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich) as the counter and reference electrode (SSE side) and a stainless-steel disk as the working electrode (SSE + CB side). The cells were tested with a potentiostat/galvanostat Biologic MPG-2 after a 4 h rest at 60 °C. CV measurements have been performed into a 1.3 &lt;
