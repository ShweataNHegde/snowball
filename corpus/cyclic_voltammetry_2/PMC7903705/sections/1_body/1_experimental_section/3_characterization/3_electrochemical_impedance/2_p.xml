<p>Li-ion conductivity data for the samples were obtained by collecting the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra following the procedure reported in ref (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). The EIS measurements were performed using an HP4192A LF impedance analyzer and a Novocontrol (BDS 1200) sample cell in the temperature range of 20 &lt; 
 <italic>T</italic> &lt; 130 °C (every 10 °C). By using an axial hydraulic press (60 MPa), the mixtures were pelletized, with a diameter of 10 mm and a thickness of about 0.2–0.6 mm. Impedance data were analyzed via the EqC software
