<p>TiS
 <sub>2</sub> (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich) was selected as the active material for the cathode. The TiS
 <sub>2</sub> and LiBH
 <sub>4</sub> powders were mixed in an agate mortar using a 1:1 weight ratio. The resulting mixture was used as the positive electrode. A two-layered pellet was prepared with 2 mg of the positive electrode mixture and 25 mg of the SSE by cold pressing at 240 MPa using a uniaxial hydraulic press (diameter 6 mm). A pure lithium disk was used as the negative electrode. The assembled bulk-type TiS
 <sub>2</sub>/SSE/Li SSB was placed in a 3/4″ PTFE Swagelok-type cell. The galvanostatic cycling was performed in the voltage range of 1.7–2.5 V at 60 °C and at RT. EIS measurements were also performed in the symmetric configuration Li/SSE/Li and on the TiS
 <sub>2</sub>/SSE/Li SSB during the rest time, before the battery cycling, and after each discharge and charge.
