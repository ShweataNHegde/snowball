<p>The highly conductive layer of LiBH
 <sub>4</sub> in direct contact with the oxide, whose thickness has been estimated to be about 2 nm, does not undergo a structural phase transition.

 </sup> Indeed, for samples CE74 and CE53, the calculated thicknesses of LiBH
 <sub>4</sub> are 0.4 and 1.2 nm, respectively (see 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref>
 </xref>), which are close to the values estimated in the literature.

 </sup> On the other hand, the calculated thickness of LiBH
 <sub>4</sub> for composite CE26 amounts to 3.8 nm, explaining the slight increase of the Li-ion conductivity above 110 Â°C (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>a) and confirming that the bulk LiBH
 <sub>4</sub> contributes to the Li-ion conductivity after the phase transition.
