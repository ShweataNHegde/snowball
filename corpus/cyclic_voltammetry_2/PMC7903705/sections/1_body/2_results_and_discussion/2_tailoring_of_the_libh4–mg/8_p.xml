<p>For sample CE74, the pore-filling fraction is lower than 100%; therefore, the highly conductive phase does not percolate throughout the sample and the conductive pathway is interrupted by the oxide. A similar effect occurs in sample CE26, where the excess of the low conductive orthorhombic LiBH
 <sub>4</sub> interrupts the conductive pathway.
