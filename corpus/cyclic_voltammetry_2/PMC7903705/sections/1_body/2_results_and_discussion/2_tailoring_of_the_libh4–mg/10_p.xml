<p>The Li-ion conductivity of CE74 and CE53 composites does not show, at 110 Â°C, the typical step due to the phase transition of LiBH
 <sub>4</sub>, which is slightly visible for the CE26 sample (see also 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsaem.0c02525/suppl_file/ae0c02525_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Figure S3</ext-link>). This suggests that the contribution of the hexagonal phase of LiBH
 <sub>4</sub> is negligible in the CE74 and CE53 samples at high temperatures, whereas it is relevant for the CE26 sample.

 </sup> This behavior can be explained by assuming a homogeneous distribution of the LiBH
 <sub>4</sub> layer on MgO, as reported in our previous work,
