<p>In order to explore the phase composition of the different composite, after synthesis, the PXRD patterns were collected (

 <sub>4</sub> was detected only for sample CE26, that is, for a pore filling higher than 100%, indicating that the excess of hydride contained in this composite is partially present as the RT polymorph.
