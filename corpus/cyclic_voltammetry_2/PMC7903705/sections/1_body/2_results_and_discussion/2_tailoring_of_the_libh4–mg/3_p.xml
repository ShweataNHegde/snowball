 <sup>–4</sup> S cm
 <sup>–1</sup> at 20 °C), about 4 orders of magnitude higher than that of pure LiBH
 <sub>4</sub>. The 20 °C Li-ion conductivities of CE26 and CE74 were 1.07 × 10
 <sup>–4</sup> and 5.94 × 10
 <sup>–6</sup> S cm
 <sup>–1</sup>, respectively. The Li-ion conductivity of sample CE26 at 40 °C (2.57 × 10
 <sup>–4</sup> S cm
 <sup>–1</sup>) is in agreement with the data already reported for the same composition and at the same temperature (1.80 × 10
 <sup>–4</sup> S cm
 <sup>–1</sup>).

 </sup> The improved Li-ion conductivity likely relies on the formation of a conductive interface, described by a core–shell model.

 </sup> It was demonstrated, by solid-state NMR, that the interface layer between LiBH
 <sub>4</sub> and silica is characterized by a high ion dynamics, for both BH
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>–</sup> and Li
 <sup>+</sup>, and cannot be defined with a clear crystal structure.

 </sup> The exact relation between the interface layer structure and the dynamics of ions needs further investigation.
