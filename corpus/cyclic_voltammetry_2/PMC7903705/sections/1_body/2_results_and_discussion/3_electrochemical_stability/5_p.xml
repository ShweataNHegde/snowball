<p>The cell polarization is rather steady at 20 mV for the whole period, indicating a long-term stability and that no parasitic reactions between the SSE and lithium occur in this low potential region. Indeed, a well-performing electrochemical material should show a stable polarization, reflecting the electrolyte resistivity and interfacial effects, in case they are present. LiBH
 <sub>4</sub> has been already reported to be able to plat/strip lithium for a longer time and at higher current densities.
