<p>The chemical compatibility toward metallic lithium was evaluated with galvanostatic cycling in a Li|CE53|Li symmetrical cell at 60 Â°C, allowing to also determine the extent of the reversible lithium plating/stripping at the SSE surface and, at the same time, its reductive stability. The results, shown in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref>, demonstrate that lithium is plated and stripped reversibly for over 90 h.
