<p>Next to a high Li-ion conductivity, a suitable SSE should have a wide electrochemical stability window and a good chemical compatibility with electrodes. The electrochemical stability of the CE53 sample has been evaluated by CV at 60 Â°C (

 </xref>a). The interface between a solid electrolyte pellet and a flat metallic Au working electrode can result in a low contact surface area and thus a high interface resistance, which can cause difficulty in the signal detection, for example, overestimating the electrochemical stability window. Therefore, in order to increase the probed surface, a carbon material was added, as described elsewhere.
