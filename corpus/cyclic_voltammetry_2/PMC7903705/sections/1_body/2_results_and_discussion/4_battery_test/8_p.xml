<p>The self-discharge due to the formation of the Li
 <sub>2</sub>B
 <sub>12</sub>H
 <sub>12</sub> SEI is also observed in this case but with a higher extent with respect to the test performed at RT (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>). The higher self-discharge observed is consistent with a faster kinetics of the reaction of LiBH
 <sub>4</sub> to form Li
 <sub>2</sub>B
 <sub>12</sub>H
 <sub>12</sub>, which is favored by the higher temperature.
