<p>As mentioned above, Unemoto 
 <italic>et al.</italic>(
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>) reported results on an SSB very similar to that investigated in the present study but using pure LiBH
 <sub>4</sub> instead of a composite as the SSE and operating at 120 °C since h-LiBH
 <sub>4</sub> was necessary to achieve the high Li-ion conductivity. The obtained capacity retention was 88% after 300 cycles at a C/5 rate. It has been reported that the higher working temperature increases the Li diffusion,

 </sup> strongly limiting the void formation at the electrode interface during the stripping process. This effect limits the contact resistance evolution, significantly reducing the capacity fading, as observed by Unemoto 
 <italic>et al.</italic>(
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>) even in the absence of an appropriate stack pressure, unlike the reported case at 60 °C. In contrast, the results reported here show that a drastical decrease of the operating temperature (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, from 120 °C to RT) is possible, thanks to a LiBH
 <sub>4</sub>–MgO nanocomposite as the solid electrolyte and the formation, at 60 °C, of a stable SEI. It is the first time that the formation of a stable SEI at a temperature (60 °C) higher than the operating one (RT) is applied to a hydride solid electrolyte and it is probably also relevant for other SSEs working in full solid-state LIBs, as already reported by Rodrigues
