 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>) observed a similar behavior for the Li|LiBH

 <sub>12</sub>H

 <sub>4</sub> interface, forming H

 <sub>2</sub>, self-discharging the battery.

 </sup> In the present case, the self-discharging reaction to form a solid electrolyte interface (SEI), as evidenced by the capacity difference between the first and the second cycle, is much less extended than that reported by Unemoto 
 <italic>et al.</italic>(
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>) (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, discharge capacities of 80 and 205 mA h g
 <sup>–1</sup> for the first and second cycles, respectively). This is probably due to a kinetic limitation in the reaction of LiBH
 <sub>4</sub> to form likely Li
 <sub>2</sub>B
 <sub>12</sub>H
 <sub>12</sub> as a consequence of the lower temperature.
