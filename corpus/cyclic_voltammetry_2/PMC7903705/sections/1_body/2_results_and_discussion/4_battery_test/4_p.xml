 </xref> shows that it was possible to collect data for only five cycles before the cell failure and several spikes are visible in the charge profiles, but they are completely missing during discharges. These results suggest an inhomogeneous Li plating and it may be induced by the imposition of a current density exceeding the so-called critical current density,
