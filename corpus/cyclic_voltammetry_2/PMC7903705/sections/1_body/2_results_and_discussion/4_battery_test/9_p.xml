 </xref>b shows the discharge/charge capacity, Coulombic efficiency, and discharge capacity retention ratio to the second discharge as a function of cycle number. The capacity retention has been calculated with respect to the second discharge capacity since in the first run the capacity is overestimated due to the self-discharge reaction occurring at the TiS
 <sub>2</sub>/LiBH
 <sub>4</sub> interface. The discharge capacity retention is more than 80% after 65 cycles, which is promising for a stable battery operation at this temperature.
