<p>Finally, the cost of solid electrolyte materials is important, as well as effective large-scale production. The U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) has adopted an ambitious target of 10 $/m
 <sup>2</sup> for the cost area of solid electrolyte materials,

 </sup> considering a 10 μm thickness. The SSE synthetized in this work is composed by easily available raw materials making the cost less than 2 $/g, corresponding to about 80 $/m
 <sup>2</sup>. Considering that the up-scaling might decrease the cost, LiBH
 <sub>4</sub>-based composites could be considered as competitive candidates to be used in Li-ion SSBs.
