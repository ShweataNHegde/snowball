<p>It is worth noting that after the 30th cycle (

 </xref>a), a pronounced decrease of the capacity is observed (

 <sup>â€“1</sup> for the 2nd, the 30th, and the 65th cycle, respectively). On the other hand, the Coulombic efficiency is always close to 99.9% up to the 10th cycle (

 </xref>b), indicating that the capacity fading occurs during the charge, namely, at a voltage higher than the oxidative stability of LiBH
