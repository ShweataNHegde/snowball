<p>For the sake of clarity, only selected galvanostatic profiles are shown. A high capacity retention was observed over 65 cycles when the battery operated at 60 °C. A rather low discharge capacity has been observed at the first cycle (101 mA h g
 <sup>–1</sup>). On the other hand, its value at the second cycle amounts to 175 mA h g
 <sup>–1</sup> that corresponds to about 73% of the theoretical capacity of TiS
 <sub>2</sub> (239 mA h g
 <sup>–1</sup>).
