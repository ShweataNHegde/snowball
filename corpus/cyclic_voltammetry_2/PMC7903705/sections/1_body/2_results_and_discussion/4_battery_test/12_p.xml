<p>In order to investigate a possible dependence of SEI formation from the amount of LiBH
 <sub>4</sub> in the SSE, that is, from the LiBH
 <sub>4</sub>/MgO volume ratio, a similar cell was built using the CE26 composite as the electrolyte. Figure S5 in the

 <sub>2</sub> at 60 °C, with a current density of 4.8 mA g
 <sup>–1</sup> (corresponding to C/50). Also, in this case, the capacity obtained on the second cycle (176 mA h g
 <sup>–1</sup>) is higher compared to that observed for the first one (82 mA h g
 <sup>–1</sup>), confirming the occurrence of a self-discharge reaction, as described above. Interestingly, when comparing the properties of cells with CE26 and CE53 as SSEs, the same behavior is observed, that is, a stabilization of the capacity fading after a certain number of cycles. In this case, the change is observed at the 58th cycle, a time-shift that can likely be due to the slower kinetics imposed by lower current rates (C/50 instead of C/20).
