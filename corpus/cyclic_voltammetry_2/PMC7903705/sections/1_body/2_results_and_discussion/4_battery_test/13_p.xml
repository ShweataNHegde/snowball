<p>The high Li-ion conductivity of the CE53 composite and the formation of an SEI at a high temperature allow the battery to operate at RT. Therefore, after 65 cycles performed at 60 °C, the temperature of the test for the Li|CE53|TiS
 <sub>2</sub> cell decreased to RT. A 4 h rest has been applied in order to equilibrate the temperature.
