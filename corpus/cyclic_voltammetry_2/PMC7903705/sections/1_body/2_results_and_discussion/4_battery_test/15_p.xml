 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>
 </xref>). It is clear that the decrease of the working temperature causes an increase of the cell polarization, indicating that the capacity drop (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, between the last cycle at 60 °C and the first cycle at RT) can be assigned to kinetic limitations due to the low temperature. During the 4 h rest, the evolution of the cell resistance was monitored by means of

The increase of the cell resistance during the 4 h rest at RT is mainly related to the decrease of the ionic conductivity of the SSE. Figure S7b in the
