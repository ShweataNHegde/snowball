<p>In this work, fast ionic conductors in the solid state, based on the LiBH
 <sub>4</sub>–MgO system, were investigated. The samples were mechanochemically synthetized. The Li-ion conductivity of LiBH
 <sub>4</sub> was improved in all cases, and the samples containing 53 v/v % of MgO showed the best enhancement (2.86 × 10
 <sup>–4</sup> S cm
 <sup>–1</sup> at 20 °C), since the volume fraction of LiBH
 <sub>4</sub> allowed to completely fill the pore volume of MgO. The formation of a highly conductive layer does not affect the electrochemical stability window, which is similar to that of pure LiBH
 <sub>4</sub> (
