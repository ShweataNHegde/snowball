<p>A test at RT in a TiS
 <sub>2</sub>/Li SSB allowed only five cycles before the cell failure. From a battery test at 60 °C, the incorporation of the solid electrolyte in the battery showed that a stable SEI is formed during the first charge/discharge cycles, causing an initial increase in contact resistance but limiting a further decomposition of the composite electrolyte. Afterward, the battery worked at RT for up to 30 cycles, with a specific capacity of about 50 mA h g
