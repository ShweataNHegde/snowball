<p>In conclusion, it has been demonstrated that the SEI, formed at 60 Â°C, allowed to reduce the operating temperature of the SSB down to RT. Therefore, a possible novel strategy to obtain an SSB working at RT, using complex hydrides as electrolytes, can be established by the formation of a stable SEI at higher temperatures. Despite this proof-of-concept, further optimization is mandatory to obtain an efficient battery (
