<p>The Tafel slope values were calculated to further demonstrate the reaction dynamics of the electrocatalysts as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00261-f005">Figure 5</xref>c, Tafel slope values of Co@CNTs-600, Co@CNTs-700, Co@CNTs-800, Co@CNTs-900, and Pt/C were calculated to be 118, 112, 111, 114, and 125 mV·dec
 <sup>−1</sup> respectively, which indicated that Co@CNTs-800 showed the fastest kinetics for electrocatalytic ORR [
 <xref rid="B49-nanomaterials-11-00261" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In addition, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was recorded in 0.1 M KOH to determine their ORR behavior. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00261-f005">Figure 5</xref>d shows the Nyquist plots of all the electrodes. The high frequency semicircles reflect the ion adsorption kinetics and charge transfer resistance (Rct). Co@CNTs-800 with a smaller semicircle showed faster ion adsorption kinetics and charge transfer than Co@CNTs-600, Co@CNTs-700, and Co@CNTs-900. The Warburg length for Co@CNTs-800 in the 45° slope lines region in the middle frequency indicated its faster ion diffusion and transport compared to Co@CNTs-600, Co@CNTs-700, and Co@CNTs-900 [
 <xref rid="B50-nanomaterials-11-00261" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. We concluded that the three-dimensional networks of Co@CNTs-800, formed out of N-doped nanotubes, were beneficial to charge transfer as well as ion diffusion and transport. Thus, Co@CNTs-800 exhibited superior electrochemical activity for ORR.
