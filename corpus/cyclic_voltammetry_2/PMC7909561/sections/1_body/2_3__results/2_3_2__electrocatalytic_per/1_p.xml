<p>The electrocatalytic activities of Co@CNTs-600, Co@CNTs-700, Co@CNTs-800 and Co@CNTs-900 were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in 0.1 M KOH with saturated O
 <sub>2</sub> or saturated N
 <sub>2</sub> at 50 mV·s
 <sup>−1</sup>. 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-11-00261">Figure S4a</xref> displays CV curves of all the electrode materials. No distinct redox peaks in N
 <sub>2</sub> saturated electrolyte can be observed for all the electrode materials, while obvious cathodic peaks appear when in O
 <sub>2</sub>-saturated electrolyte. The cathodic peak for Co@CNTs-800 (0.785 V vs. RHE, all potentials refer to RHE herein), was more positive than those of Co@CNTs-600, Co@CNTs-700, and Co@CNTs-900 (0.677, 0.734, and 0.725 V respectively). The CV results demonstrated that Co@CNTs-800 showed better catalytic activity.
