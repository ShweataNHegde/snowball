<p>The electrocatalytic ORR behavior of Co@CNTs-600, Co@CNTs-700, Co@CNTs-800, and Co@CNTs-900 were further investigated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00261-f005">Figure 5</xref>a shows the LSV curves of all the electrode materials. The half wave potentials were 0.772, 0.817, and 0.796 V for Co@CNTs-600, Co@CNTs-700, and Co@CNTs-900, respectively. For Co@CNTs-800, the half wave potential was the most positive (0.846V), which was equivalent to that of the commercial Pt/C electrode (0.846 V). The limiting current was similar (~5.0 mA cm
 <sup>âˆ’2</sup>). The results confirmed that Co@CNTs-800 exhibited better ORR performance than Co@CNTs-600, Co@CNTs-700, and Co@CNTs-900. The ORR performance of Co@CNTs-800 is equal to previously reported non-precious ORR electrocatalysts (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-11-00261">Figure S4b</xref>, the half wave potentials were 0.767, 0.806, and 0.808 V vs. RHE for blank CNTs, Co-MOF-800, and Co-Zn-MOF-800, respectively, which were lower than that of Co@CNTs-800 (0.846 V vs. RHE). The results indicated that metal centers and the introduction of N played an important role in facilitating ORR. The electron transfer number and peroxide yield of the Co@CNTs-800 catalyst were calculated by the RRDE technique. In

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> yield was only 2.63%, which indicated that the 4-electron transfer pathway played a leading role in ORR. The electrochemical stability testing of the Co@CNTs-800 catalyst was investigated by chronoamperometry methods at a potential of 0.7 V. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-11-00261">Figure S4c</xref>, the current of Co@CNTs-800 was more than 90% retention after a 12 h test. LSV curves (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-11-00261">Figure S4d</xref>) were also measured after the 12 h i-t test. Half wave potential remained almost unchanged, demonstrating the excellent stability of Co@CNTs- 800 as ORR catalyst in alkaline solution. We attributed the excellent stability to the carbon shell surrounding the crystalline Co nanoparticles acting as a protector [
