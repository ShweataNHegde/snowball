<p>X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were then used to investigate chemical configurations and the valence state of Co@CNTs-800. XPS survey spectra in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00261-f003">Figure 3</xref>c indicated C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, and Co 2p peaks with no other signals. The contents of C, O, N, and Co were 87.7, 5.33, 4.40, and 2.47 wt%, respectively. The C 1s XPS spectrum in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00261-f003">Figure 3</xref>d confirmed four kinds of C species: C=C (284.4 eV), C-C (285.2 eV), C=N (286.1 eV), and C-N (288.5 eV) [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00261-f003">Figure 3</xref>e can be fitted deconvoluted as four bands at 398.5, 399.7, 400.7, and 401.7 eV, which could be attributable to four types of N species: pyridine-N, pyrrolic-N, graphitic-N, and pyridine-N-O [

 <xref rid="B45-nanomaterials-11-00261" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. We concluded that Co@CNTs-800 had potential as an effective ORR catalyst due to the high proportion of pyridine-N and graphitic-N. The high-resolution Co 2p spectrum is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00261-f003">Figure 3</xref>f. The binding energies of 778.5 and 793.4 eV were due to 2p

 <sub>3/2</sub> and 2p
 <sub>1/2</sub> of Co
