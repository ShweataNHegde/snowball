<p>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to further study the morphology and phase composition of Co@CNTs-800. The TEM image in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00261-f002">Figure 2</xref>a revealed that the prepared nanotubes were of hundreds of nanometers in length with diameter of ~50 nm, the nanoparticles were formed at the end of the nanotubes and the diameters of the nanoparticles were about 20–60 nm. The high-resolution TEM image (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00261-f002">Figure 2</xref>b) displayed nanoparticles with spacing of 0.20 nm, which were indexed as the Miller indices (112) of Co. The results revealed that the crystalline Co nanoparticles were embedded in nanotubes, the nanoparticles were surrounded with a carbon layer, and the lattice fringe spacing of the carbon layer was 0.31 nm, assigned to the (002) plane of graphitic carbon [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00261-f002">Figure 2</xref>c–f indicated that C, Co, and N elements were distributed evenly in the nanotubes. It was noted that more Co elements were concentrated in the nanoparticles region.
