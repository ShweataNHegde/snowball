<p>The N
 <sub>2</sub> adsorption/desorption test was used to explore the surface area and pore structures of Co@CNTs-800. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00261-f004">Figure 4</xref>a, the Brunner–Emmet–Teller specific surface area was revealed to be 52.7 m
 <sup>2</sup> g
 <sup>−1</sup>. The N
 <sub>2</sub> adsorption/desorption curve exhibited a characteristic type IV isotherm and a distinct hysteresis loop at relative high pressure, demonstrating their mesoporous structure. The pore size distribution curve in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00261-f004">Figure 4</xref>b was used to confirm the mesoporous feature. The pore diameters located at 4.0, 7.6, 10.7, and 28.9 nm indicated the presence of mesopore, beneficial to the rapid mass transfer process.
