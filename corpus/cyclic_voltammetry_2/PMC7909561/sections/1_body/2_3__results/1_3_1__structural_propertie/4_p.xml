<p>X-ray Diffraction (XRD) was performed to show the chemical phase composition and XRD patterns of Co@CNTs-600, Co@CNTs-700, Co@CNTs-800, and Co@CNTs-900, displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00261-f003">Figure 3</xref>a. The broad peak located at ~26.1° corresponds to the C (002) plane. The intense peaks of Co@CNTs-600 appearing at 31.8°, 34.4° and 36.3° were successively assigned to the (100), (002), and (101) planes of ZnO, consistent with the previously reported hexagonal ZnO (JCPDS no 36-1451). The diffraction peaks appearing at 44.2°, 51.5°, and 75.8° were assigned to the (111), (200) and (220) (planes of cubic Co (JCPDS no 15-0806) [

No other diffraction peaks were seen in the XRD patterns, which demonstrated that no other phases had appeared. The characteristic diffraction peaks of ZnO disappeared in Co@CNTs-700, Co@CNTs-800, and Co@CNTs-900. The ICP-MS analysis revealed that Co@CNTs-800 contained 97.88 wt% Co and 2.12 wt% Zn, respectively. The Zn species in Co-Zn-BDC volatilized with the higher annealing temperature on account of the low boiling point of Zn during the carbonization [
