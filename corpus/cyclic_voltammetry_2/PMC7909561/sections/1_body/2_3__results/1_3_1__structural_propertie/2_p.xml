<p>The morphology of all Co@CNTs-T was also studied by SEM. The SEM images are shown in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00261-f001">Figure 1</xref>a. With the temperature rising in the range of 600–800 °C, more nanotubes arose and were distributed evenly. They were connected to constitute a three-dimensional network structure, which was beneficial to electron transfer in the electrocatalytic process [

Nevertheless, when the annealing temperature reached 900 °C, there were no visible nanotubes and only large-sized nanoparticles with diameter of 50–200 nm could be seen. We concluded that higher annealing temperatures were not suitable to form nanotubes. Besides, the mass ratio of Co-Zn-BDC/DCD was of crucial importance in producing uniform nanotubes. The SEM images for Co@CNTs-800 by annealing Co-Zn-BDC/DCD with different mass ratios (2:1 and 1:2) are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-11-00261">Figure S2</xref>. It can be seen that no visible nanotubes were produced. The mass ratio of 1:1 was most suitable for the formation of a three-dimensional network structure.
