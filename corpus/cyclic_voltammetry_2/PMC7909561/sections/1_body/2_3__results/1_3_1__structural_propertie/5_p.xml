<p>Raman spectra of Co@CNTs-T and Co@C-800 were collected to evaluate the catalyst. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00261-f003">Figure 3</xref>b and 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-11-00261">Figure S3a</xref>, the peaks appearing at 1350 and 1584 cm
 <sup>âˆ’1</sup> were attributed to disordered (D band) and graphite (G band) carbon. The I(D)/I(G) ratio of Co@CNTs-800 was 1.02, which was higher than Co@CNTs-600(1.00), Co@CNTs-700(0.99), Co@CNTs-900(0.74), and Co@C-800(0.91). More defects formed in Co@CNTs-800 which were expected to facilitate the electrocatalytic performance [

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-11-00261">Table S1</xref>, the results showed that the N contents of Co@CNTs-600, Co@CNTs-700, Co@CNTs-800, and Co@CNTs-900 were 2.75%, 3.01%, 1.87%, and 1.25%. Combined with the Raman results, we concluded that both N content and defects play an important role in enhancing ORR performance [
