<p>Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to investigate the morphology of Co- Zn-BDC, and the SEM image shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-11-00261">Figure S1a</xref> displays nanosheet morphology of Co-Zn-BDC. The XRD pattern of Co-Zn-BDC is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-11-00261">Figure S1b</xref>, the peaks appearing at 8.8°, 15.8°, 17.8°, 28.8°, 30.8° demonstrated its crystal structure, which was consistent with previous reports [
 <xref rid="B31-nanomaterials-11-00261" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-nanomaterials-11-00261" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was carried out to determine the chemical and structural information. The FTIR data of Co-Zn-BDC is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-11-00261">Figure S1c</xref>. The strong absorption peaks of H
 <sub>2</sub>BDC (black) appearing at 1673 and 1424 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> originate from the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of crude carboxylate groups (–COOH). For Co-Zn-BDC (red), the peaks were red shifted to 1573 and 1362 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, attributed to the coordination of carboxylate organic ligands and metal centers [

Then, inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to determine the Co/Zn content of Co-Zn-BDC; the result indicated that Co-Zn-BDC contained 76.73 wt% Co and 23.27 wt% Zn, respectively. Besides, thermogravimetric analysis was performed to analyze the thermal stability of Co-Zn-BDC. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-11-00261">Figure S1d</xref>, Co-Zn-BDC remained stable with a slight decrease in weight before 400 °C. As the temperature rose, the weight was lost obviously due to pyrolysis.
