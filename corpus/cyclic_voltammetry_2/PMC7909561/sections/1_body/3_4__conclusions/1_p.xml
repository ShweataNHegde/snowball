<p>In summary, Co@CNTs-800 with a three-dimensional network structure was synthesized by pyrolysis of a mixture of Co-Zn MOF and DCD. A three-dimensional network was formed out of N-doped carbon nanotubes with Co nanoparticles embedded. Benefiting from the nano-tubular structure, the as-prepared Co@CNTs-800 catalyst exhibited fast charge transfer and ion diffusion. In addition, the carbon shell coated on the Co nanoparticles was conducive in enhancing the stability of ORR electrocatalysts. Besides, more defects were created by Zn volatilization and introduction of N by DCD. Thus, Co@CNTs-800 demonstrated superior electrochemical activity for ORR as well as long-term durability. This work provides a synthetic method to prepare efficient electrocatalysts with three-dimensional networks for ORR.</p>
