<p>Metal-free electrocatalysts like carbon-based catalysts have been widely studied for their good stability. However, the average electrocatalytic performance has limited their applications [

 <xref rid="B13-nanomaterials-11-00261" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The 3d transition metal electrocatalysts (such as Ni, Fe, and Co) are considered to have promising catalytic activity due to their unique electronic structure [
