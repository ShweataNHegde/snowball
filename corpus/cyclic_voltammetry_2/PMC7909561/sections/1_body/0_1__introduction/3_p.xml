<p>Zn/Co-based MOFs are promising precursors to fabricate heteroatom-doped metal-supported carbon materials but more defects were expected to be created by Zn volatilization at high temperature. However, Zn volatilizing at high temperature could prevent the accumulation of other metal ions [

Herein, we fabricated a three-dimensional network composed of N-doped carbon nanotubes with crystalline Co nanoparticles, embedded, by calcination of Co/Zn MOF and dicyandiamide (DCD) as the precursor. The three-dimensional network, termed Co@CNTs, was constructed by regulating the annealing temperature and the mass ratios of Co/Zn MOF and DCD. The obtained Co@CNTs composite showed a nanotube structure, while crystalline Co nanoparticles were embedded at the end of the CNTs, surrounded by the carbon shell. The Co@CNTs prepared at 800 Â°C (Co/Zn MOF:DCD = 1:1) exhibited more densely packed and uniform nanotubes and better ORR performance. The half-wave potential was 0.846 V vs. RHE and showed good electrochemical stability, comparable to commercial Pt/C. This work could provide a synthetic method for economical and durable electrocatalysts with three-dimensional networks for ORR.
