<p>All chemical reagents were bought from Aladdin Reagent (Aladdin, Shanghai, China) and used directly in the present experiments. The Co-Zn-BDC was constructed by ultrasound [
 <xref rid="B30-nanomaterials-11-00261" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. First, 0.75 mmol 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (H
 <sub>2</sub>BDC) was dissolved to 36 mL mixed solution of DMF, ethanol, and deionized water with a volume ratio of 16:1:1. Subsequently, 0.75 mmol CoCl
 <sub>2</sub>âˆ™6H
 <sub>2</sub>O and 0.75 mmol ZnCl
 <sub>2</sub> were added, respectively. After the Co
 <sup>2+</sup> and Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> salts were fully dissolved, 0.8 mL of triethylamine (TEA) was then added to the solution. After stirring for 5 min the above mixture underwent 8 h ultrasonication (40 kHz). The resulting pink precipitate was collected by centrifugation and rinsed with ethanol and water, respectively, followed by vacuum freeze-drying. Co-BDC was prepared by the same method without the introduction of Zn ions.
