<p>Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, ZEISS MERLIN Compact, 20 Kv, Jena, Germany) and field emission transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI G2 F30 200 kV, Hillsboro, OR, USA) were carried out to observe the micro-morphology of Co@CNTs-T. Power X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 SmartLab (Karlsruhe, Germany) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm)) patterns were characterized to obtain crystal structures. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Escalab 250Xi, Waltham, America) was used to probe the chemical states of surface elements. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR IRTracer-100, Tokyo, Japan) was employed to analyze chemical and structural information. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, NETZSCH-200F3, Selbu, Germany) was used to analyse thermal stability. ICP-MS Agilent 7700 (Palo Alto, CA, USA) analyzed the composition of metal elements. Raman (Renishaw, London, UK) was used to analyse the purity of materials. BET (ASAP 2020, Norcross, GA, USA) analysed the specific surface area and pore size. The Organic Element Analyzer (EA Vario EL cube, Bonn, Germany) was used to analyse the CHN of materials.</p>
