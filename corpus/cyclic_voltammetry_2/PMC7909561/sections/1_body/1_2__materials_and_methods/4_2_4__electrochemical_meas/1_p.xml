<p>Typically, a homogeneous black solution was formed by fully dispersing a 3 mg sample of Co@CNTs-T, 7 mg carbon black, and 1.25 mL ethanol under ultrasound for 3 h. Then 36 μL of the ink and 6 μL Nafion solution (0.5 wt%) were coated on the pre-polished rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE, 4 mm in diameter) followed by drying at room temperature. A homogeneous Pt/C ink solution was formed by fully dispersing 3 mg commercial Pt/C and 1.25 mL ethanol under ultrasound for 3 h. Then 36 μL of the ink and 6 μL Nafion solution (0.5 wt%) were coated on the pre-polished RRDE electrode followed by drying at room temperature. The RRDE electrode covered with catalyst was used as the working electrode and the saturated Ag/AgCl electrode was used as the reference electrode. The graphite electrode was used as the counter electrode and the electrolyte was 0.1 M KOH solution (N
 <sub>2</sub> or O
 <sub>2</sub> were pumped into 0.1 M KOH solution for half an hour respectively). Cyclic voltammetry was used at the scan rate 50 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup> and linear sweep voltammetry at the scan rate of 5 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup> with a rotating speed of 1600 rpm. Besides chronoamperometry at 0.7 V (vs. RHE) testing of the prepared sample was conducted in the RRDE test system.
