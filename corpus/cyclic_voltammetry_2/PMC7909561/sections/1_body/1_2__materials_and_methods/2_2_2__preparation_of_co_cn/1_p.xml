<p>The mixture of Co-Zn-BDC and DCD with mass ration of 1:1 underwent calcination at high temperatures (600, 700, 800 and 900 °C) for 2 h under nitrogen protection at a heating rate of 5 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup>. The products were labelled as Co@CNTs-600, Co@CNTs-700, Co@CNTs-800, and Co@CNTs-900, respectively. The schematic synthetic process is depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="nanomaterials-11-00261-sch001">Scheme 1</xref>. Co-MOF-800 was prepared by annealing Co-BDC at the temperature of 800 °C, and Co-Zn-MOF-800 was synthesized by annealing CO-Zn-BDC at the temperature of 800 °C.
