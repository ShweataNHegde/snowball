<p>In our previous report, we found that by changing Cu and Sn ratio in the Mg-Cu-Sn alloy, Cu-Sn alloys or composite with different phase compositions can be achieved via dealloying [
 <xref rid="B28-materials-14-04348" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Herein, in this study, we applied the as-dealloyed Cu
 <sub>6</sub>Sn
 <sub>5</sub> alloy and Cu
 <sub>6</sub>Sn
 <sub>5</sub>/Sn composite as the LIB anode. The as-dealloyed anode was found to have excellent cycling stability and rate performance due to the nanoporous structure. Moreover, the anode material has good thermal stability due to the formation of intermetallic Cu
 <sub>6</sub>Sn
 <sub>5</sub>, favoring the cycling. The ex situ XRD proved the reverse phase transformation between Cu
 <sub>6</sub>Sn
 <sub>5</sub> and Li
 <sub>2</sub>CuSn during charge/discharge process.
