<p>The phase compositions of the precursors and dealloyed samples were confirmed by XRD in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-04348-f001">Figure 1</xref>. As exhibited in our previously reported study [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-04348-f001">Figure 1</xref>b) both consist of Mg
 <sub>2</sub>Sn (PDF # 65-2997) and Mg
 <sub>2</sub>Cu (PDF # 65-5460) phases. Only a minor amount of Mg
 <sub>2</sub>Cu is present, which indicates that substantial Cu enters the lattice of Mg
 <sub>2</sub>Sn to form Mg
 <sub>2</sub>(Sn,Cu) phase. The dealloying of Mg

 <sub>10.2</sub>Sn
 <sub>23.8</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-04348-f001">Figure 1</xref>d) in 1 wt.% TA resulted in the formation of np-Cu

 <sub>6</sub>Sn
 <sub>5</sub>/Sn (PDF # 65-2303/PDF # 65-0296) composites, respectively, as described in ref [
 <xref rid="B28-materials-14-04348" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It has been discussed that the formation of Cu
 <sub>6</sub>Sn
 <sub>5</sub> involved the selective dissolution of Mg and co-diffusion of Cu and Sn [
 <xref rid="B28-materials-14-04348" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The phase formation process was different from the dealloying of Al-Cu-Sn alloys, of which heating was required to form Cu-Sn alloys [
 <xref rid="B22-materials-14-04348" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-materials-14-04348" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The difference in precursor type not only determines the dealloying process, but also has an effect on the microstructure of dealloyed alloys. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-04348-f002">Figure 2</xref>a and 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-14-04348">Figure S1</xref>, the as-dealloyed Cu
 <sub>6</sub>Sn
 <sub>5</sub> derived from Mg
 <sub>67</sub>Cu
 <sub>18</sub>Sn
 <sub>15</sub> has ultra-fine bi-continuous ligament-channel morphology. EDS spectra confirms the co-existence of Cu and Sn (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-04348-f002">Figure 2</xref>b). Magnified TEM image shows that the average pore size is below 40 nm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-04348-f003">Figure 3</xref>a), which is comparable to that from dealloying of Al
 <sub>10</sub>Cu
 <sub>3</sub>Sn in a 20 wt.% NaOH solution [
 <xref rid="B22-materials-14-04348" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. When increasing the content of Sn to 23.8 at.%, large skeletons with particles attached instead of nanoporous ligament-channel structure was formed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-04348-f002">Figure 2</xref>c or 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-04348-f003">Figure 3</xref>b and 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-14-04348">Figure S1</xref>). Combined with XRD results in ref [
 <xref rid="B28-materials-14-04348" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], the skeletons should be Cu
 <sub>6</sub>Sn
 <sub>5</sub> while the particles are composed of Sn. EDS spectra in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-04348-f002">Figure 2</xref>d shows higher relative Sn contents in the composite, corresponding to higher Sn ratio in the precursor. HRTEM in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-04348-f003">Figure 3</xref>c shows well-aligned lattices corresponding to as-dealloyed Cu
 <sub>6</sub>Sn
 <sub>5</sub> alloy. The lattice distance indicates that the ligaments are identified to Cu
 <sub>6</sub>Sn
 <sub>5</sub>. Moreover, the corresponding FFT pattern (inset of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-04348-f003">Figure 3</xref>c) verifies the nanocrystalline nature of Cu
 <sub>6</sub>Sn
 <sub>5</sub> ligaments.
