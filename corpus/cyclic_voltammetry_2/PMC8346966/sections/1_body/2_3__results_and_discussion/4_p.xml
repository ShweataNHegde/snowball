<p>The charge/discharge cycling performance of Cu
 <sub>6</sub>Sn
 <sub>5</sub>/Sn composite was also tested. The initial charge capacity is higher than 800 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup>, better than that of Cu
 <sub>6</sub>Sn
 <sub>5</sub>, suggesting the contribution of Sn in the composite (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-04348-f006">Figure 6</xref>a). The capacity can be kept at around 200 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup> for at least 550 cycles, comparable to that of np-Cu
 <sub>6</sub>Sn
 <sub>5</sub>. At a higher current density of 0.5 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>, the capacity could maintain 150 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-14-04348">Figure S3</xref>). The Cu
 <sub>6</sub>Sn
 <sub>5</sub>/Sn composite also shows an inferior rate performance, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-04348-f006">Figure 6</xref>b. When the current density was reversed to 0.2 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>, the capacity could only maintain around 60% of its initial capacity at 0.2 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>. The inferior cycling performance might be attribute to the Sn particles with large volume expansion during charge/discharge process [
