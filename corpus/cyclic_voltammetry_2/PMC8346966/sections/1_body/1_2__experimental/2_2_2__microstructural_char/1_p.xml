<p>The microstructures of the as-dealloyed samples were investigated with scanning electron microscope (SEM, LEO 1530P, LEO Electron Microscopy Ltd., Oberkochen, Germany) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, Philips CM 20, FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR, USA). The crystalline nature was probed using high-resolution TEM (HRTEM, FEI Tecnai G2, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED, FEI Tecnai G2, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms were measured with a surface area and porosity analyzer (Gold APP V-Sorb 2800, Gold APP Instruments, Beijing, China) at 77 K. Specific surface area was determined using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. Pore size distribution was calculated from the adsorption branch by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method using the corrected form of Kelvin equation. The ex situ XRD patterns of the discharged/charged samples were determined by a XD-3 diffractometer (Beijing Purkinje, Beijing Purkinje General Instrument Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) equipped with Cu-Ka radiation as described before [
