 <sub>23.8</sub> (at.%) precursor ribbons were prepared from rapid solidification. Pure Mg, Cu and Sn metal blocks (purity: 99.9 wt.%) were melted in an alumina crucible using a resistance furnace (KYKY Technology Co., Ltd., Shenyang, China) under the protection of covering agent at about 800 °C. The melt liquid was cast into an alloy rod in a module. The obtained alloy rod was cut into ingots and remelted at 800 °C using a high-frequency induction furnace (KYKY Technology Co., Ltd., Shenyang, China) in a quartz tube with a pinhole below. The alloy melt was blasted onto a copper roller spinning at 1000 revolutions per minute from the pinhole by an Ar blow. The precursor ribbons obtained were collected for dealloying. The dealloying of Mg-Cu-Sn precursor ribbons was performed in a 1 wt.% tartaric acid (TA) at room temperature until no bubbles emerged. The as-dealloyed ribbons were rinsed with deionized water and dehydrated alcohol for further characterizations and applications.
