<p>The as-dealloyed samples were ball-milled to fine powders with zirconia beads at a rotation speed of 300 rpm for 3 h. The Cu
 <sub>6</sub>Sn
 <sub>5</sub> or Cu
 <sub>6</sub>Sn
 <sub>5</sub>/Sn powders (80 wt.%) were ground with acetylene black (Super-P, 10 wt.%) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder (10 wt.%) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) solvent to make a slurry. The slurry was coated onto Cu foil and further dried at 80 °C for 12 h under vacuum. The coated Cu foil was punched into disk shape of 12 mm in diameter, with the low mass loading of around 0.5 mg/cm
 <sup>2</sup>. The as-prepared foil was used as the working electrode. A Li foil was used as both the reference electrode and counter electrode and a polypropylene (PP) film (Celgard 2325) was utilized as the separator. The electrolyte was made by mixing 1.0 M LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> with ethylene carbonate (EC) and DMC (1:1 by volume). The CR2032-type coin cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box (Mikrouna Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China), with oxygen and moisture levels below 0.1 ppm. The galvanostatic discharging/charging tests were conducted at various current densities at the voltage window between 0.01 and 2.00 V (vs. Li
 <sup>+</sup>/Li) using a LANDCT2001A test system. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup> between 0.01 and 2.00 V (vs. Li
 <sup>+</sup>/Li) on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660E).
