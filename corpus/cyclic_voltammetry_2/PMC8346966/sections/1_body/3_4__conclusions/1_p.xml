<p>In summary, nanoporous Cu
 <sub>6</sub>Sn
 <sub>5</sub> alloy and Cu
 <sub>6</sub>Sn
 <sub>5</sub>/Sn composite were prepared via dealloying and their performance as lithium-ion battery anodes were tested. The dealloyed np-Cu
 <sub>6</sub>Sn
 <sub>5</sub> presented an ultrafine ligament-channel structure with ligament size below 40 nm and BET specific area of 15.9 m
 <sup>2</sup> g
 <sup>−1</sup>. The 3D nanoporous structure and high specific area endowed the anode with high lithium-ion battery performance. The anode displayed a capacity of higher than 600 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup> for the initial five cycles at 0.1 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>. It also had excellent cycling performance for at least 350 cycles at 0.1 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>, with a reversible capacity of higher than 200 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup>. The ex situ XRD patterns reveal the reverse phase transformation between Cu
 <sub>6</sub>Sn
 <sub>5</sub> and Li
 <sub>2</sub>CuSn. Similar performance was obtained from Cu
 <sub>6</sub>Sn
 <sub>5</sub>/Sn composite. This study provided a practice for fabricating highly stable Sn-based anode in lithium-ion batteries.
