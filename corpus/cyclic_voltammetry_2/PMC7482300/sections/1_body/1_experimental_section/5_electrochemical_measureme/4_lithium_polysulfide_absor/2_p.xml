<p>Li
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>6</sub> (0.5 M) was prepared by adding lithium sulfide (Li
 <sub>2</sub>S) and elemental sulfur (1:5 molar ratio) in DOL and DME solvents (1:1 v/v). The suspension was stirred continuously for 72 h inside a glovebox for obtaining Li
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>6</sub>. For the LPS absorption test, Li
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>6</sub> was further diluted by adding 8 μL of Li
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>6</sub> in 4 mL of DOL and DME solvents (1:1 v/v). The samples (10 mg) were added to the above solution, mixed for 30 min, and allowed to stand for 10 h. The supernatant of the samples was analyzed by UV–vis spectra using a Cary 100 UV–vis spectrophotometer from Agilent Technologies.
