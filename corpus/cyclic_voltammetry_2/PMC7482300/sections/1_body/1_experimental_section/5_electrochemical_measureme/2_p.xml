<p>The cathode of Li-S battery was prepared by mixing 75% active material (NC-S), 10% acetylene black, and 15% poly(vinylidene fluoride) binder (PVDF) with 
 <italic>N</italic>-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent in the form of a slurry. The well-prepared slurry was cast over the aluminum foil using the doctor blade technique and dried at 80 °C overnight. Similarly, bulk sulfur (S) cathode was prepared by mixing 65% sulfur, 25% carbon, and 10% binder. The dried slurry-coated aluminum foil was cut in the shape of circular disks with a 12 mm diameter and served as the working electrode. The sulfur loading was controlled as 2.5–2.8 mg cm
 <sup>–2</sup>. Li-S battery was fabricated in 2032 coin cells using NC-S or S electrodes as a cathode, glass fiber (GF/C) as a separator, and lithium metal as an anode. Bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (1 M, LITFSI) and LiNO
 <sub>3</sub> additive (0.2 M) in 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) and 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) (1:1 v/v) was used as an electrolyte. The coin cell fabrication was carried out inside a glovebox (Mbraun) by maintaining O
 <sub>2</sub> and H
 <sub>2</sub>O levels &lt;0.1 ppm. The coin cells were assembled with and without MgB
 <sub>2</sub> interlayers.
