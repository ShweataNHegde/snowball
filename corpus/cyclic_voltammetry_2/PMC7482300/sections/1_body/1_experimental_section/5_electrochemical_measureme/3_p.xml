<p>Cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), dynamic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (DEIS) measurements were recorded using the Biologic VSP 300 electrochemical test station, and galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles were recorded using Biologic BCS-810 battery cycler. The CV and galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles were recorded in the potential range of 2.8–1.7 V. The EIS and DEIS measurements were recorded in the frequency range of 100 mHz to 1 MHz.</p>
