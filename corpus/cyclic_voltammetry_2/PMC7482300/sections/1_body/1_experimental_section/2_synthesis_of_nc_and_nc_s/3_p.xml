<p>Sulfur-incorporated nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NC-S) is synthesized by the melt-diffusion method. First, sublimed sulfur and NC are taken in a 4:1 ratio and a homogeneous mixture of sulfur and NC was obtained by grinding well for 1 h. The sample was sealed in an ampoule and heated to 155 °C very slowly and maintained at that temperature for 12 h and further annealed at 300 °C to vaporize the surface-deposited sulfur. Sulfur infiltration into the NC network was carried out at 155 °C, where sulfur is in a molten state with the lowest viscosity and can quickly diffuse through the pores of NC by capillary forces, which are a very slow process, and polymerization of S
 <sub>8</sub> takes place.
