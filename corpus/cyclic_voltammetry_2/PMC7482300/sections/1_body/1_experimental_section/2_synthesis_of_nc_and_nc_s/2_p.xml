<p>Synthesis of nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NC) involves a facile thermal decomposition technique. Briefly, melamine, glucose, and sodium bicarbonate were taken as nitrogen, carbon, and pore-forming precursors, respectively. Melamine, glucose, and sodium hydrogen carbonate were taken in the molar ratio of 1:1:1 and well ground with the help of a mortar and pestle. The ground mixture was loaded into a horizontal tubular furnace and heated at a heating rate of 5 °C min
 <sup>–1</sup> to 800 °C and held at this temperature for 2 h. After the furnace temperature reaches room temperature, the sample was washed with ethanol and deionized water for the removal of sodium content and any unreacted compounds. The final NC sample was obtained by filtering and drying the washed sample at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 10 h. The pore formation mechanism is dependent on the hydrogen-bond interactions with the material precursors. Melamine consists of molecules like N–H···N bonds arranged in planar sheets, which are connected with HCO
