<p>X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were recorded using a Rigaku Smartlab X-ray diffractometer with Cu K
 <sub>α</sub> radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) at 40 kV and 100 mA embedded with a nickel filter. The XRD patterns were recorded with a step size of 0.02°, in the range of 10–90°. The surface area analysis of the synthesized samples was studied by recording nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms at a liquid nitrogen temperature using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020. The specific surface area and porosity of the samples were calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) theories, respectively. The morphology of the synthesized samples was characterized by an Inspect F50 scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and a Technai G20 transmission electron microscopy (TEM) instruments. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectra analysis (EDS) measurements were studied using an Inspect F50 instrument. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out using an SDT Q600 from TA Instruments, at a heating rate of 20 °C min
 <sup>–1</sup> from room temperature to 1000 °C. The chemical structure/bonding of the samples was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) from a Specs X-ray photoelectron spectrometer using Al K
 <sub>α</sub> enabled with PHOIBOS 100MCD analyzer as an X-ray source.
