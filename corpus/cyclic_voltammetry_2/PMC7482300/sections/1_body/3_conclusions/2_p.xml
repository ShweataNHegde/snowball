<p>In summary, nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NC) with interconnected pores has been synthesized by a facile one-step synthesis method and used as the sulfur host (NC-S) for Li-S battery. The high surface area for NC can accommodate a high amount of sulfur loading in the cathode and also provide space for the sulfur volume change and prevent pulverization. The NC-S cathode delivers higher specific capacity (554 mA h g
 <sup>–1</sup> at 0.1C) and rate capability (up to 2C) than bulk sulfur (S) cathode, signifying the role the porous of the carbon structure. To prevent the polysulfide dissolution and inhibit the active material losses, room-temperature metallic and polar material MgB
 <sub>2</sub> has been used as an interlayer. The sulfur cathode with MgB
 <sub>2</sub> interlayer (S/MgB
 <sub>2</sub>) delivers a specific capacity of 1015 mA h g
 <sup>–1</sup> at 0.1C rate, much higher than the sulfur cathode, owing to the inherent LPS adsorption property of MgB
 <sub>2</sub>. The NC-S cathode with MgB
 <sub>2</sub> interlayer (NC-S/MgB
 <sub>2</sub>) delivers a specific capacity of 1218 mA h g
 <sup>–1</sup> at 0.1C rate higher than the S/MgB
 <sub>2</sub> cathode. Moreover, the NC-S/MgB
 <sub>2</sub> cathode shows excellent cycling stability up to 500 cycles, with 85% of capacity retention. The high performance of NC-S/MgB
 <sub>2</sub> can be attributed to the synergy between the interconnected porous network of the NC cathode and the strong LPS adsorption capability of the MgB
 <sub>2</sub> interlayer. The dynamic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (DEIS) analysis elucidates the electrochemical reaction kinetics of the NC-S/MgB
 <sub>2</sub> cathode during the charging and discharging processes. In conclusion, the synergy of the lithium polysulfide confinement and conversion reactions of the NC-S/MgB
 <sub>2</sub> cathode paves the way for the development of high-energy-density lithium-sulfur batteries.
