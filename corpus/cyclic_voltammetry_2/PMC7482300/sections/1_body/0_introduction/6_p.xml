<p>In the present work, a simple one-step synthesis has been approached from the synthesis of highly porous nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) without using KOH or templates. The nitrogen-doped porous carbon is used as the sulfur host (NC-S) to fabricate the cathode. SEM, TEM, and surface area measurements confirm the highly porous nature of NC. Magnesium diboride coated on the carbon cloth with high LPS adsorption is used as the interlayer. Li-S batteries are tested with NC-S cathode with and without the MgB
 <sub>2</sub> interlayer. To understand the significant performance of the NC-S cathode, the cells were fabricated using 65% sulfur, 25% carbon, and 10% binder as bulk sulfur cathode with the MgB
 <sub>2</sub> interlayer and compared to the NC-S cathode with MgB
 <sub>2</sub> interlayer.
