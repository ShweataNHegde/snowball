<p>In this work, we report the layer-structured and room-temperature metallic nature MgB
 <sub>2</sub> as an interlayer to mitigate LPS shuttling. MgB
 <sub>2</sub> consists of alternative layers of magnesium and boron atoms, where the boron layer forms honeycomb stacks with the magnesium layer as a space filler.

 </sup> MgB
 <sub>2</sub> has similar band structures to graphite with deeper π bands and coexistence of 2D covalent bands from in-plane sigma bonds and 3D metallic conducting bands from the interlayer-made MgB
 <sub>2</sub> as the most attractive material in the field of superconductivity.

 </sup> The application of metallic, layered, and structured MgB
 <sub>2</sub> as the lithium polysulfide immobilizer is not explored much. Recently, Linda F. Nazar’s group has reported ultra-lightweight MgB
 <sub>2</sub> as the polysulfide mediator for LPS redox reaction.

 </sup> They have stated that both magnesium and boron centers bind S
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>2–</sup> anions in the absence of Li
 <sup>+</sup> cations, which can enhance the diffusion of Li
 <sup>+</sup> ions. The interaction reported here is different from the previously reported Lewis acid–base interactions on chalcogenides, carbides, and nitrides with LPS.
