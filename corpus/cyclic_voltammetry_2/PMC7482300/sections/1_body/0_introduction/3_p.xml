<p>The electrical conductivity and wettability of the sulfur and discharge product lithium sulfide (Li
 <sub>2</sub>S) can be enriched by incorporating sulfur into carbonaceous host materials. This can improve the specific capacity, rate capability, and cyclic stability of the Li-S battery.

 </sup> These parameters also depend on the choice of carbonaceous host. In this context, porous carbon nanostructures are considered as more suitable materials owing to their high specific surface area, controlled pore size distribution, and chemical and thermal stabilities.

 </sup> Porous carbon with the combination of mesoporous and microporous structures can enhance the active materials storage and utilization and therefore, mitigate the lithium polysulfide shuttling.

 </sup> For the synthesis of porous carbon structures, many approaches have been made using various templates. These processes are time-consuming, have complex synthesis routes, and costly.

 </sup> Besides, addition of a nitrogen dopant to the porous carbon structure can enhance the interaction between the lithium polysulfides (LPS) and carbon structure, thereby improving the performance of the Li-S battery.

 </sup> In the present work, a nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NC) has been synthesized by the facile thermal decomposition method. For this, sodium bicarbonate is used as pyrogen, and melamine and glucose are used as nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively. The highly porous nitrogen-doped carbon is used as a sulfur host (NC-S).
