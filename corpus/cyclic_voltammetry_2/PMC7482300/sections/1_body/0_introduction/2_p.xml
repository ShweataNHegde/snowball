<p>Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are considered as the next-generation electrochemical energy storage devices owing to their high energy density (2600 Wh kg
 <sup>–1</sup>) and theoretical capacity (1672 mA h g
 <sup>–1</sup>). Besides, eco-friendliness, low cost, and wide availability of sulfur cathode make it a promising candidate.

 </sup> However, the poor ionic/electronic conductivity of sulfur/discharged products, pulverization of sulfur during the redox reactions, dissolution of intermediately formed lithium polysulfides (LPS) into the electrolyte, and shuttle mechanism are the major barriers for the development of Li-S batteries in a larger scale.

 </sup> These issues give rise to low coulombic efficiency, poor cyclic stability, and active material losses of Li-S batteries. For commercialization of Li-S batteries, the above-mentioned challenges should be addressed.
