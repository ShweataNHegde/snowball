<p>The morphology of the synthesized samples is studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy.

 </xref>a shows the SEM images for NC, where randomly distribute interconnected open pores are clearly visible. After sulfur incorporation into nitrogen-doped porous carbon, SEM of NC-S illustrates a porous network with some pores filled with sulfur nanoparticle (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref>b). The open pores of NC still remain the same. The presence of open pores, mainly mesoporous and microporous networks, can efficiently store the active material inside the cathode, therefore improving the active material utilization. The microporous configuration can accelerate the diffusion of Li
 <sup>+</sup> ions, electrolyte, and electron pathways.

 </xref>c displays the TEM image of NC. The interconnected channels of the pores with uniform distribution are illustrated. The TEM image of NC-S depicts the dark sulfur particles over the porous network of the nitrogen-doped carbon, as shown in

 </xref>e depicts the TEM of NC-S, where the sulfur particles inside the porous carbon network are highlighted with yellow arrows. The presence of sulfur inside the nitrogen-doped porous is confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectra analysis (EDS) measurements.

 </xref>f represents the EDS pattern of NC-S, and the quantification of elements is given in the

 </xref>f inset pie chart. The nitrogen content in NC-S is found to be 4.5%, which can also help in improving the active material utilization in Li-S battery.
