<p>The long-term cyclic stability of the NC-S, S/MgB
 <sub>2</sub>, and NC-S/MgB
 <sub>2</sub> cathodes are evaluated at 1C rate in the potential window 2.8â€“1.7 V for 500 cycles (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>
 </xref>). The NC-S without any interlayer could show cyclic performance up to 500 cycles, while the capacity value is less. At the end of 500 cycles, the NC-S cathode could retain 66.4% of its initial capacity. S/MgB
 <sub>2</sub> cyclic stability curves indicate the decrease in the specific capacity values with increasing number of cycles. The capacity retention of the S/MgB
 <sub>2</sub> cathode after 500 cycles is 71%. Even though MgB
 <sub>2</sub> has strong adsorption toward LPS, the poor stability of the sulfur cathode degrades the performance of the S/MgB
 <sub>2</sub> cathode. The cyclic performance of the NC-S/MgB
 <sub>2</sub> cathode is illustrated in 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>
 </xref>. The NC-S/MgB
 <sub>2</sub> cathode could retain 85% of its initial capacity after 500 cycles, with nearly 99% coulombic efficiency. This suggests the synergistic effect of highly porous nitrogen-doped carbon host and layered metallic MgB
 <sub>2</sub>. As reported in the literature, Mg and B atoms can adsorb polysulfide anions strongly and facilitate Li
 <sup>+</sup>-ion diffusion without binding to Mg and B atoms.

 </sup> This has also contributed to the enhanced cyclic stability and rate capability of the MgB
 <sub>2</sub> interlayer. Nitrogen doping of the carbon lattice, mainly pyridinic-N and graphitic-N, can strongly bind the LPS via chemisorption and minimize the active material losses.

 </sup> Therefore, combination of the materials of these two properties, such as the NC-S/MgB
 <sub>2</sub> cathode for Li-S battery, results in an increase of specific capacity, rate performance, and cyclic stability of the battery.
