<p>Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out in the air atmosphere to estimate the decomposition temperature of NC and in a nitrogen atmosphere to find the sulfur weight % in the NC-S sample.

The weight loss below 150 °C indicates the removal of surface-adsorbed moisture. From 200 to 450 °C the NC sample wt % remains constant, and above 500 °C, the major decomposition occurs due to oxidation of carbon in NC. The TGA profile of NC-S carried out in the nitrogen atmosphere is shown in

The decomposition above 200 °C illustrates the oxidation of sulfur, and the final weight of sulfur in NC-S is 78 wt %. This suggests that the high surface and porous network of NC could accommodate a large amount of sulfur in it. The dominant sulfur peaks in the NC-S XRD pattern is due to the large amount of sulfur in the present sample.
