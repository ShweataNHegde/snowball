 </xref>b depicts the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms obtained at 77 K for NC. The sample illustrates type IV isotherm with a hysteresis loop above 0.5 relative pressure suggests the mesoporous structure of the NC. Besides, the high nitrogen uptake in the low-relative-pressure region (&lt;0.1) indicates the presence of micropores in the sample. The specific surface area of the NC sample estimated based on the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method is 1272.4 m
 <sup>2</sup> g
 <sup>–1</sup>. The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method is used to calculate the pore volume and pore size of NC.

 </xref>c represents the pore size distribution of NC. The sample consists of both mesopores (4 nm) and micropores (&lt;2 nm), as indicated in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>c inset. The NC shows a total pore volume of 1.04 cm
 <sup>3</sup> g
 <sup>–1</sup>, including mesopore and micropore volumes of 0.77 and 0.277 cm
 <sup>3</sup> g
 <sup>–1</sup>, respectively. The high surface area and porosity of the NC sample can enhance the electrochemical reactivity of the sulfur by providing more surface area and improved diffusion of Li
 <sup>+</sup> ions and electrolytes into the porous network for the reactions to occur.
