<p>The reaction kinetics of the NC-S, S/MgB
 <sub>2</sub>, and NC-S/MgB
 <sub>2</sub> cathodes were studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. The Nyquist plots for NC-S, S/MgB
 <sub>2</sub>, and NC-S/MgB
 <sub>2</sub> cathodes after CV measurements are shown in 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>
 </xref>d. All the Nyquist plots comprise the depressed semicircles in the high- and mid-frequency regions and an inclined line in the low-frequency region. Nyquist plots have been fitted with an equivalent circuit model in the inset of

 </sup> Besides, the LPS adsorption property of MgB
 <sub>2</sub> also enhances the redox kinetics of sulfur and promotes the high utilization of active materials. The NC-S/MgB
