 <sub>2</sub> cathode at different C rates. The specific capacities obtained by the S/MgB
 <sub>2</sub> cathode at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2C rates are 1015, 830, 627, 537, and 371 mA h g
 <sup>–1</sup>, respectively. After the addition of the MgB
 <sub>2</sub> interlayer, the specific capacity values drastically improved, suggesting the strong LPS adsorption of the MgB
 <sub>2</sub> surface. The Li-S battery performance of the NC-S cathode is also evaluated with the MgB
 <sub>2</sub> interlayer. The galvanostatic charge–discharge profile obtained for the NC-S/MgB
 <sub>2</sub> cathode from 0.1C to 2C is shown in

 <sub>2</sub> cathode delivers specific capacities of 1218, 1077, 946, 809, and 624 mA h g
 <sup>–1</sup> at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2C rates, respectively. These specific capacity values are much higher than the NC-S cathode without interlayer and the S/MgB
 <sub>2</sub> cathode, indicating that the highly porous nitrogen-doped carbon architecture with a strong LPS MgB
 <sub>2</sub> adsorption mediator interlayer has significantly contributed to the confinement of the LPS shuttle effect. Therefore, the synergy between the NC-S cathode and the MgB
 <sub>2</sub> interlayer delivers higher specific capacity values at all current densities. The polarization values Δ

 <sub>2</sub> cathode shows lower polarization than the other cathodes owing to the synergy of inherent polysulfide adsorption property of the MgB
 <sub>2</sub> interlayer and nitrogen dopant sites in the porous carbon structure.
