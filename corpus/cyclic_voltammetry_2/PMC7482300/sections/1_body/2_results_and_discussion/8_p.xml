<p>Galvanostatic charge–discharge studies were carried out at different C rates (1C-1672 mA g
 <sup>–1</sup>) in the potential range of 2.8–1.7 V. The galvanostatic discharge curves indicate two plateaus at 2.38 and 2.1 V corresponding to the reduction of S
 <sub>8</sub> to higher-order and lower-order lithium polysulfides (LPS). In the charge curve, the plateaus indicate the oxidation Li
 <sub>2</sub>S to lower-order LPS, higher-order LPS, and back to S
 <sub>8</sub>.

 </xref>a depicts the galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles for S cathode without any interlayer. In the first discharge cycle at 0.05C rate, the sulfur cathode delivered a specific capacity of 452 mA h g
 <sup>–1</sup>, and in the second cycle, the discharge specific capacity increased very little to 459 mA h g
 <sup>–1</sup>, which might be due to the rearrangement of sulfur atoms. However, the charge profile of the first cycles is overlapped by that of the second cycle; therefore, it is not identified clearly in

 </xref>a. When the C rate increases to 0.1C, the specific capacity of the S cathode decreases to 342 mA h g
 <sup>–1</sup>, and the second plateau at 2.08 V falls to 1.95 V with a slopping line rather than plateau. This indicates the pulverization of the pure sulfur cathode and the shuttling of LPS. The galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles for the NC-S cathode are shown in

 <sup>–1</sup> at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2C rates, respectively. The NC-S cathode delivers higher specific capacity and rate capability than the S cathode, signifying the role of the porous carbon structure, which acts as a buffer layer to accommodate the volume changes occurred during the redox reactions of the sulfur.

 </sup> Even though the specific capacity and current uptake are higher than those of pure S cathode, the unstable discharge plateaus at higher C rates indicate that the additional interlayer can improve the specific capacity of the cathode.
