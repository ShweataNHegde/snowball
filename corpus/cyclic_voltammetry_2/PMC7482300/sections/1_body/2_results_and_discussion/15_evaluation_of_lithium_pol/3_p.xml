<p>To understand the interaction of LPS with electrode and interlayers, the morphology of the cycled electrode and interlayers and uncycled electrodes are studied SEM images.

 </xref>b illustrates the SEM image of the uncycled NC-S electrode with interconnected open pores. After cycling the NC-S electrode, the pores of nitrogen-doped porous carbon covered the polysulfides, suggesting the porous structure of NC contributed to anchoring the LPS in the cathode (

 </xref>dâ€“f, respectively. The morphology of the cycled MgB
 <sub>2</sub> interlayer with the NC-S cathode is changed when compared to the uncycled one where larger and discrete particles of the MgB
 <sub>2</sub> interlayer are identified. This can be due to the adsorption of LPS on its surface. The cycled MgB
 <sub>2</sub> interlayer with S cathode shows the high polysulfide deposition of LPS on the surface of MgB
 <sub>2</sub> with very less discrete particle nature. This can be attributed to the poor adsorption capability of the sulfur cathode.
