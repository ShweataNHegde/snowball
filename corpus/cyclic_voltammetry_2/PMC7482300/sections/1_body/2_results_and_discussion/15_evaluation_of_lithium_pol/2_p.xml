<p>The adsorption capability of nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NC) and MgB
 <sub>2</sub> toward LPS is evaluated by the LPS adsorption test. For this, NC and MgB
 <sub>2</sub> are added in a blank Li
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>6</sub> solution, mixed well, and kept undisturbed for 10 h inside an argon-filled glovebox.

 </xref>a inset displays the digital photographs of blank Li
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>6</sub> solution and Li
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>6</sub> solution with NC and MgB
 <sub>2</sub> samples. Compared to the blank Li
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>6</sub> solution, the NC sample shows a very light yellowish color due to the adsorption of LPS. The MgB
 <sub>2</sub> sample solution becomes completely transparent, suggesting the strong adsorption of LPS on its surface. This is further analyzed using UV–vis photospectrometer by collecting the supernatant solution of NC and MgB
 <sub>2</sub> samples. A UV–vis spectrum is obtained for the blank Li
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>6</sub> solution for comparison. In

 </xref>a, the UV–vis spectra of the blank Li
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>6</sub> solution show a peak at ∼357 nm corresponding to the absorbance of S
 <sub>6</sub>
 <sup>2–</sup> anions.

 </sup> The peak intensity reduces for the supernatant solution NC, indicating the adsorption of LPS on the surface but not completely. On the other hand, for the MgB
 <sub>2</sub> supernatant solution, the peak at ∼357 nm disappears, indicating the absence of Li
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>6</sub> in the solution. Moreover, the intensity of absorbance also reduces for the supernatant solution of MgB
 <sub>2</sub> compared to NC and blank Li
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>6</sub> solution. This also corroborates the strong adsorption capability of MgB
 <sub>2</sub> toward LPS, which can minimize the shuttle effect during cycling. This also infers that polar metallic compounds have strong LPS adsorption capability over carbonaceous materials. However, the carbonaceous material as the sulfur host can accommodate a large amount of sulfur loading and suppress the volume changes during the redox cycle due to its high surface and porosity.
