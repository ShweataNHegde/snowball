<p>The capability of the Li-S battery with the NC-S, NC-S/MgB
 <sub>2</sub>, and S/MgB
 <sub>2</sub> cathodes delivering the specific capacity at higher C rates is evaluated by rate performance studies.

  <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>
 </xref>c shows the rate performances of the NC-S, NC-S/MgB
 <sub>2</sub>, and S/MgB
 <sub>2</sub> cathodes from 0.1 to 2C rates. The rate performance of the NC-S/MgB
 <sub>2</sub> cathode is higher than the S/MgB
 <sub>2</sub> cathode due to the nitrogen-doped interconnected porous structure of carbon, which can minimize the shuttling of LPS.

 </sup> All the cathodes significantly deliver specific capacity up to 2C rate. However, the NC-S cathode without a MgB
 <sub>2</sub> interlayer shows lower specific capacity, and after the addition of a MgB
 <sub>2</sub> interlayer to the NC-S cathode, the specific capacity values significantly enhanced, contributing to the conductive carbon host and the polar interlayer. All the cells are cycled up to 2C rate and switched back to the 0.1C rate. The capacity retentions after switching to 0.1C for the NC-S, S/MgB
 <sub>2</sub>, and NC-S/MgB
 <sub>2</sub> cathodes are 95.9%, 91%, and 96.6%, respectively. The NC carbon host could retain maximum specific capacity after rate performance can be attributed to the low overpotential measured from the CV profiles of the NC-S/MgB
 <sub>2</sub> cathode.
