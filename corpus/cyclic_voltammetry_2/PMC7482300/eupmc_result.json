However, poor electrical conductivity of sulfur/discharged products, low active material utilization, shuttle mechanism, and poor cycle life remain the major challenges for the development of Li-S batteries. Herein, we report the nitrogen-doped highly porous carbon (NC) with interconnected pores as the sulfur host (NC-S), which is synthesized by a facile one-step process without using any template and activation agents. The highly interconnected porous structure of NC can accommodate a high amount of sulfur loading and provide space for sulfur volume expansion during redox reactions. Besides, to mitigate the lithium polysulfide dissolution and shuttle mechanism, metallic and polar magnesium diboride (MgB<sub>2</sub>) is used as an interlayer. Consequently, the NC-S/MgB<sub>2</sub> cathode delivers higher specific capacity, rate capability, and excellent cyclic stability than the NC-S cathode and bulk sulfur cathode with MgB<sub>2</sub> interlayer. The lithium polysulfide (LPS) adsorption test shows that MgB<sub>2</sub> has strong chemisorption toward lithium polysulfides, which can inhibit the dissolution of LPS into the electrolyte and minimizes the shuttle effect. The dynamic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis investigates the electrochemical reaction kinetics of the NC-S/MgB<sub>2</sub> cathode during the charging and discharging processes.
