 <sup>–1</sup>of the ZIB full cells with the WiTS gel electrolyte for different halide-based cathodes. As expected, G–ZnCl
 <sub>2</sub> showed a very low capacity with the absence of any useable voltage plateau due to the irreversible reaction. The G–ZnI
 <sub>2</sub> and G–ZnBr
 <sub>2</sub> cathodes showed voltage plateaus that correspond to their respective redox reactions, G–ZnI
 <sub>2</sub> at 1.17 V and G–ZnBr
 <sub>2</sub> at 1.67 V vs Zn/Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>, in agreement with the CV data. The cathode made from the equimolar mixture of ZnCl
 <sub>2</sub> and ZnBr
 <sub>2</sub> showed two discharges voltage plateaus: a small one at 1.90 V, due to the Cl
 <sup>–</sup>/Cl
 <sub>2</sub> redox reaction, and the other at 1.67 V due to the Br
 <sup>–</sup>/Br
 <sub>2</sub> redox reaction. Nonetheless, the specific capacity of each cathode is much lower than the theoretical capacity of a halogen GIC (309 mAh g
 <sup>–1</sup> for MBr
 <sub>n</sub> and 632 mAh g
 <sup>–1</sup> for MCl
 <sub>n</sub>).

 </sup> Among the cathodes tested, the best specific capacity (55 mAh g
 <sup>–1</sup>) was obtained using G–ZnCl
 <sub>2</sub>–ZnBr
 <sub>2</sub> with the others being lower than 30 mAh g
 <sup>–1</sup>. However, the capacity decayed by more than 50% after 200 cycles due to the continual formation of zinc carbide species (

The specific capacity quoted is based on the total mass of the cathode (mass of graphite plus mass of halide).
