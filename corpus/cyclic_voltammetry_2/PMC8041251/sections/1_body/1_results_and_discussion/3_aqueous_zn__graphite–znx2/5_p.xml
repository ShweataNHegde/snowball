 <sup>–1</sup> and a small D-band at ∼1350 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>, being shown and no other bands associated with Zn halides. The fully charged G–ZnI
 <sub>2</sub> electrode displayed an intense Raman signal at 172 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> due to surface-bound iodine species.

 </sup> However, the absence of a G-band splitting suggests that there is no intercalation of the iodide species into the graphite galleries (see the inset of 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref>A). While other halogens including chlorine and bromine intercalate into graphite, iodine has a strong affinity for adsorption rather than intercalation.

 </sup> G–ZnBr
 <sub>2</sub> also exhibited similar behavior when fully charged where it showed a signal at 240 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> due to the stretching mode of Br
 <sub>2</sub>.

 </sup> The G-band of the material, however, was split into two Raman modes: the E
 <sub>2g2i</sub> mode at ∼1580 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> due to the interior unintercalated original layers and the E
 <sub>2g2b</sub> at 1604 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> due to the bounding layers next to the intercalants. The fact that the intensity of the E
 <sub>2g2i</sub> mode is twice that of the E
 <sub>2g2b</sub> together with the higher wavenumber for the E
 <sub>2g2b</sub> reflects the dilute staging of bromine species into graphite galleries.

 </sup> The opposite trends were observed during discharge that involves the desorption/deintercalation of the halogen at each cathode (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref>B) characterized by the absence of halogen-related bands, further confirming the reversibility of the process. This 
 <italic>in situ</italic> Raman spectroscopy data shows that reversible surface adsorption/desorption is the dominant reaction mechanism in G–ZnI
 <sub>2</sub> and G–ZnBr
 <sub>2</sub> electrodes. This observation is similar to Na chemistry at a graphite electrode where Na plates are on the graphite surface rather than intercalating due to its size and weaker chemical interaction with the graphite planes.
