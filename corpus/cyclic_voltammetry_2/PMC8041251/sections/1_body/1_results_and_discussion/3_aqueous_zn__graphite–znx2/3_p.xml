<p>In contrast, the CV obtained using the G–ZnCl
 <sub>2</sub> cathode showed a lower current and a lower degree of reversibility with a sharp undefined oxidation peak and a small reduction peak. The poor reversibility of G–ZnCl
 <sub>2</sub> suggests the formation of an irreversible product during battery charging. This is in contrast to G–LiCl which has been reported to display a reversible Cl
 <sup>–</sup> conversion–intercalation process in WiSEs.

 </sup> The fact that the conversion–intercalation of ZnCl
 <sub>2</sub> is irreversible suggests that the metallic counterions have a strong impact on the conversion–intercalation process. It has been shown that the chemical intercalation of ZnCl
 <sub>2</sub> into graphite forms a strong complex with the carbon species to form ZnCl
 <sub>2</sub>–carbon.

 </sup> Indeed, characterization of a fully charged G–ZnCl
 <sub>2</sub>-containing electrode using XPS showed the formation of C–Zn–C bonds at a low binding energy (283.0 eV) when analyzing the high-resolution C1s spectrum (

 </sup> Furthermore, the signal due to Zn carbide is still present and increased for the fully discharged cathode, which confirms the irreversibility of the process, manifested in the CV response (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref>C). The slight shift to high binding energy (283.5 eV) during discharge indicates a change in the environment of C1s presumably due to the increase in the concentration of chloride along with Zn inside the carbon. This data demonstrates that ZnCl
 <sub>2</sub>-based cathode materials cannot be combined with sp
 <sup>2</sup>-carbon to form a secondary ZIB.
