<p>The electrode that contained ZnCl
 <sub>2</sub> (neat or mixed with ZnBr
 <sub>2</sub>) on the other hand showed a more intense E
 <sub>2g2b</sub> at 1609 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>, approximately twice that of the E
 <sub>2g2i</sub>, a characteristic of the formation of a stage-3 GIC.

 </sup> However, the G-band splitting remained after the battery was fully discharged, which demonstrates that the intercalation process is nonreversible, in agreement with the XPS analysis (inset of 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref>B). Furthermore, the fully charged G–ZnCl
 <sub>2</sub> or G–ZnBr
 <sub>2</sub>–ZnCl
 <sub>2</sub> did not show the band associated with Cl
 <sub>2</sub> (expected in the region of 530–570 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>) intercalant due to the reaction of ZnCl
 <sub>2</sub> with the graphite host as previously discussed.

 </xref>C shows the Raman spectrum response for the G–ZnI
 <sub>2</sub>–ZnBr
 <sub>2</sub> composite electrode. It is interesting to note that significant Raman frequency shifts for both iodide and Br-species were observed when analyzing the G–ZnI
 <sub>2</sub>–ZnBr
 <sub>2</sub> sample. When the cell was charged to 1.4 V, a broad band at 172 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> due to surface-bound iodine species (also the case for G–ZnI
 <sub>2</sub> charged to 1.9 V) was seen. When the voltage was increased to 1.9 V, sharp bands at 180 and 189 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> were observed along with the G-band splitting. The formation of these new bands is most likely due to the formation of interatomic IBr intercalants.

 </sup> A frequency downshift is often observed for surface-bound halogen when compared to free halogen due to the interaction of halogen with host materials, which weakens the interatomic bonds of the intercalants.

 </sup> In contrast, the G–ZnCl
 <sub>2</sub>–ZnBr
 <sub>2</sub> sample did not show the BrCl formation due to the reaction of ZnCl
 <sub>2</sub> with the graphite (
