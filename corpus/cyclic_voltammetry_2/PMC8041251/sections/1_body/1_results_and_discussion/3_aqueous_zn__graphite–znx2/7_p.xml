<p>Overall, the analysis of Raman spectra indicates that the size of halogens significantly impacts the reaction mechanism at the graphite cathode. The conversion–adsorption process occurs when the halogen is larger, for example in G–ZnI
 <sub>2</sub>, and the conversion–intercalation process occurs for smaller halogens such as G–ZnCl
 <sub>2</sub>. Even though ZnCl
 <sub>2</sub> can reach a reasonably high intercalation staging, the irreversible reaction is the hindering factor for use in practical ZIBs. The low capacity of the full-cell battery at each electrode is explained by the conversion–adsorption reaction mechanism, which needs a high surface area carbon rather than the low surface area graphite.
