<p>In summary, this Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>-conducting WiTS gel electrolyte provides the advantage of safety (as it is nonflammable) and enables certain battery components to be removed (such as the polymer separator). The elimination of the separator from the cell will significantly reduce the contact resistance of the interface. Then, we consider the cathode chemistry involving the carbon host.
