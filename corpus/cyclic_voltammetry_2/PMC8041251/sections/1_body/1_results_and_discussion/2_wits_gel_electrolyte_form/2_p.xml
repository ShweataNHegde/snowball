<p>The robust Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> conducting gel electrolyte was formulated from water-in-trisalt (WiTS) electrolyte by mixing ZnSO
 <sub>4</sub>, Zn(TFO)
 <sup>2</sup>, and LiTFSI (in a 1:1:2 mass ratio, respectively) in 20% water using 10% poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) polymer binder. The resulting white gel is a highly flexible, yet semisolid, electrolyte that can be molded to any shape (inset of
