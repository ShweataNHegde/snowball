<p>The long-term electrochemical reversibility of the Zn plating and stripping processes in the WiTS gel electrolyte was investigated using a Zn|Zn symmetric cell under galvanostatic and CV methods.

 </xref>C shows the CV obtained before and after several charge–discharge cycles; and in each case, the gel electrolyte exhibited reversible Zn redox chemistry with the ratio between the anodic (

 <sub>p,a</sub>) and cathodic peak currents (
 <italic>i</italic>
 <sub>p,c</sub>) being one which indicates that the Coulombic efficiency of the cell is near 100%. The kinetics of Zn oxidation/reduction, however, significantly improved after cycling, as exemplified by the peak-to-peak (Δ
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>P</sub>) separation that decreased from ∼0.4 to 0.2 V. The decrease in Δ
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>P</sub> with cycling is most likely due to the removal of surface oxides from Zn, which impede electron transfer. In addition, the current due to Zn oxidation/reduction is increased by a factor of 5 after cycling, which could be due to an increase in the active surface area. The charge–discharge curve (

  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>D) also showed similar behavior where the overpotential (η) for Zn stripping/plating decreased from about 0.6 to 0.2 V after 10 cycles and stabilized at 0.2 V even after the cell was cycled for 40 h at 0.2 mA cm
 <sup>–2</sup>. The cell can operate continuously without short circuiting (no formation of dendrites) for over 400 h at 0.1 mA cm

 <sub>4</sub>), a rapid polarization started to occur after nine cycles most likely due to the formation of Zn dendrites and other associated problems including oxide formation (

 </sup> These observations demonstrate that the gel electrolyte is an excellent Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> conductor with very facile Zn stripping/plating kinetics. Both the stability and the kinetics of the Zn couple in the WiTS gel electrolyte are superior to those in solution-based aqueous and nonaqueous ionic liquid-based electrolytes.
