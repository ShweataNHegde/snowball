<p>The specific capacity of Zn|AC–ZnCl

 <sub>2</sub>I
 <sub>2</sub> is 479 mAh g
 <sup>–1</sup> at 0.05 A g
 <sup>–1</sup>, which decreased to 230 mAh g
 <sup>–1</sup> at 1.0 A g
 <sup>–1</sup>. The gravimetric capacitances of Zn|AC–ZnCl
 <sub>2</sub>Br
 <sub>2</sub>I
 <sub>2</sub> ranged from 400 to 930 F g
 <sup>–1</sup> depending on the applied current density (

 </xref>C). This figure also demonstrates the importance of the Zn halides to the cathode chemistry, proving that the cathodic process involved the immobilized Zn halides. Based on the mass of the cathode (mass of activated carbon plus mass of ZnX
 <sub>2</sub>), the energy densities of 422 and 160 Wh kg
 <sup>–1</sup> at power densities of 122.8 and 1071.7 W kg
 <sup>–1</sup> were obtained. These values are higher than the energy density of all other cathode materials reported to date for ZIBs including MnO

 </sup> The cell energy density ranged between 55 Wh kg
 <sup>–1</sup> (at 1.0 A g
 <sup>–1</sup>) and 140 Wh kg
 <sup>–1</sup> (at 0.05 A g
 <sup>–1</sup>), assuming that the weight of the cathode material within a pouch cell configuration is a third of the total mass of the cell.

 </sup> These values are much higher than those of typical commercial supercapacitors (5–10 Wh kg
 <sup>–1</sup>), lead-acid batteries (30–40 Wh kg
 <sup>–1</sup>), and Zn-ion capacitors (17–30 Wh kg
 <sup>–1</sup>).

 </sup> The energy density of the Zn|AC–ZnCl
 <sub>2</sub>Br
 <sub>2</sub>I
 <sub>2</sub> cell is even higher than a Li-ion capacitor, where the energy density varies between 30 and 90 Wh kg
 <sup>–1</sup>.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref>
 </sup> Li-ion capacitors often use intercalation-type anodes and adsorption-type cathodes (adsorption of large complex anions ([PF
 <sub>6</sub>]
 <sup>−</sup>, [TFSI]
 <sup>−</sup>, [BF
 <sub>4</sub>]
 <sup>−</sup>, etc.)), where their overall energy density is limited by the capacitor-type electrode.
 <sup>

 </sup> The advantages of using halide ion conversion–adsorption within carbon cathodes are (i) they are smaller than most organic anions so that the migration/diffusion of ions is faster, (ii) they are inside the carbon structure so that they do not have to diffuse to the surface from bulk electrolyte, and (iii) they undergo reversible fast redox reactions, which substantially provide an extra charge, unlike inert anions.

 </sup> The combination of these factors is responsible for the high performance of the Zn|AC–ZnCl
 <sub>2</sub>Br
 <sub>2</sub>I
 <sub>2</sub> cell. The cell also truly combines the characteristic high energy density of a battery with the high power density of a supercapacitor device. For example, this cell can be fully charged within a few minutes (6 min) at high power and can be discharged for over 5 h at lower rates (see
