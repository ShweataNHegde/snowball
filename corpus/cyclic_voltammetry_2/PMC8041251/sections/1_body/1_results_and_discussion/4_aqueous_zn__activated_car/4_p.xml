In other words, the preadsorption of iodine, due to its low redox potential, on the AC surface improved the kinetics of bromine adsorption, which in turn improves the kinetics of chlorine adsorption similar to an electrodeposition process.

This indicates that the halide ions are fully oxidized to molecular halogen and coadsorbed to the AC pore, which can sublime under the ultrahigh vacuum of the XPS. Nevertheless, the presence of preadsorbed halogen on the AC surface was confirmed using

The images after charging showed a pore swelling with significant size expansion due to the adsorption of halogens. Each of the expanded pores contained several smaller holes. The small pores could be created by the evaporation of the adsorbed halogen under the SEM-operating vacuum that leaves holes behind.
