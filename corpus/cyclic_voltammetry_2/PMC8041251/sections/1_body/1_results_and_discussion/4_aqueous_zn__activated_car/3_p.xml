 <sub>2</sub>I

 <sub>2</sub> could be due to a denser adsorption of halide ions on the carbon microstructure. The enhancement in performance of the mixed halide cathode is possibly due to the reduction of Coulombic repulsion of the adsorbed halides and an electrocatalytic effect. It has been shown that the intercalation/adsorption density of halogen on a carbon surface is approximately twice as large as Li–GIC. This is because the oxidation state of the halogen is close to zero, which reduces the average effective charge per halogen atom. This minimizes the Coulombic repulsion and, in turn, increases the adsorption density of halogen on the carbon pore.

 </sup> Furthermore, the Coulombic repulsion is expected to be further reduced within the carbon microstructure host when the three-halide species (Cl
 <sup>–</sup>, Br
 <sup>–</sup>, and I
 <sup>–</sup>) are adsorbed next to one another. The low Coulombic repulsion in the AC–ZnCl
 <sub>2</sub>Br
 <sub>2</sub>I
 <sub>2</sub> electrode over individual AC–ZnX
 <sub>2</sub> can enhance the packing density of halogens on the carbon surface. Indeed, Yang et al. also observed that the performance of individual LiBr–carbon or LiCl–carbon cathodes is inferior to the binary combination of the LiClBr–carbon cathode.
