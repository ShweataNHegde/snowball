The increase in capacity could be due to the gradual activation of the electrode, which increases the number of active electrochemical sites for ion adsorption. Finally, the WiTS gel electrolyte performance was tested using a traditional α-MnO

 <sub>2</sub> cell. The gel electrolyte exhibited a Coulombic efficiency of over 99% with specific capacities that were increased from 162 to 210 mAh g
 <sup>–1</sup> after 50 cycles. This indicates that the WiTS gel electrolyte is as efficient as traditional aqueous electrolytes (such as 1 M ZnSO
 <sub>4</sub>), but with additional advantages such as the absence of parasitic water reduction reactions, elimination of the need for a separator, and other advantages that semisolid state devices provide, e.g., flexibility. The combination between the WiTS gel electrolyte and ZnX
 <sub>2</sub>–carbon composite cathode in conjunction with aqueous gel electrolytes offers the tantalizing possibility of solving the issues of poor ZIB performance. This study also provided the very first fundamental understanding of halogen conversion chemistry inside crystalline and amorphous carbon.
