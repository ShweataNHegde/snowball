<p>All chemicals are of analytical grade and obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, Fluorochem or Alfa Aesar and used as received. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD spectrometer with a monochromated Al Kα X-ray source (
 <italic>E</italic> = 1486.6 eV, 10 mA emission). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis was carried out using a FEI Quanta 650 FEG environmental SEM. Powder X-ray diffraction analysis was performed using a Philips X’pert PRO diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) and operating at 40 kV and 30 mA.
