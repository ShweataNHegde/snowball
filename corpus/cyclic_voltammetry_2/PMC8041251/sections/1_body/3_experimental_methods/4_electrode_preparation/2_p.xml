<p>For the preparation of the carbon–ZnX
 <sub>2</sub> cathode, first the desired amount of ZnX
 <sub>2</sub> (anhydrous ZnCl
 <sub>2</sub>, ZnBr
 <sub>2</sub>, ZnI
 <sub>2</sub>, or mixture of two or more halides) was dissolved in 0.5 g of water followed by slow addition of natural graphite (−325 mesh, 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich) or activated carbon (YEC-8B, Fuzhou Yihuan Carbon Co., Ltd) while mixing homogeneously with a mortar and pestle. The mass ratio between ZnX
 <sub>2</sub> and carbon was 1:3. PTFE suspension (5% with respect to the mass of carbon) was added to the thick slurry and mixed to uniformly coat the mixture with the polymer binder. The excess water was removed by heating the mixture on a hot plate. The resulting carbon–ZnX
 <sub>2</sub> clay was quite flexible and could be made as a free-standing film or rolled onto a prepunched (15 mm diameter) titanium (99.99%, Alfa Aeser) foil current collector. The composite electrode was dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight. The typical mass loading of the carbon–ZnX
 <sub>2</sub> composite electrode ranged from 2 to 5 mg cm
