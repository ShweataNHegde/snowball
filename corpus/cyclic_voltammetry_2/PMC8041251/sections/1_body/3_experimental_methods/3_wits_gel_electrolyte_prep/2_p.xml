 <sub>2</sub>O (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), 2 g of zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate (98%, Fluorochem), and 4 g of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (99%, Fluorochem) were mixed together with 1.5 g of ultrapure water (Milli-Q, 18 MΩ cm resistivity) in a mortar and pestle until a uniform white paste formed. Subsequently, 1.3 g (10% of total salt) of a 60% PTFE suspension was added and mixed with a mortar and pestle. The mixture was then heated at 80 °C on a hot plate for 30 min to remove any excess water. A semisolid elastic gel was formed, which can be changed into any desired shape (
