<p>Raman spectra were obtained using a Renishaw inVia microscope with a 532 nm excitation laser operated at a power of 0.274 mW with a grating of 1800 lines/mm and 50× objective. The 
 <italic>in situ</italic> Raman cell was obtained from ECC-Opto-Std (EL-Cell GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) and the cell was comprised of a free-standing carbon–ZnX
 <sub>2</sub> positive electrode and a Zn foil negative electrode with a WiTS gel electrolyte. A titanium foil that contained a small hole in its middle (diameter ca. 1 mm) was used as a current collector for the positive electrode. The exciting laser beam was shone through a thin glass window onto the rear of the free-standing carbon–ZnX
 <sub>2</sub> film through the small hole in the center of the Ti foil. Spectral scans were collected in a backscattering configuration. The Raman measurements were collected at various voltages as the cell charged and discharged at 1 mV s
