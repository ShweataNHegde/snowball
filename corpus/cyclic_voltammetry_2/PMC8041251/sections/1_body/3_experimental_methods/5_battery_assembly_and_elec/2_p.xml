<p>The full cells were assembled in CR2032-type coin cells using carbon–ZnX
 <sub>2</sub> as the cathode and Zn foil as the anode. The flexible gel electrolyte was spread onto the Zn foil with an approximate thickness of 0.5–1.0 mm and acted as both the electrolyte and separator. The coin cell was sealed using a hydraulic crimping machine (MSK-160D) in an ambient atmosphere. Three-electrode cell electrochemical measurements were conducted using a WiTS gel electrolyte that was rolled onto a microscopy glass slide for electrode connection. A glassy carbon working electrode, Pt wire counter electrode, and Zn metal reference electrode were used. Electrochemical measurements were performed using an Autolab potentiostat (model PGSTAT302N, Metrohm Autolab, The Netherlands). The charge–discharge battery tests were carried out using a Basytec Cell Test System (BaSyTecGmbH, Asselfingen, Germany) with 32 independent test channels. The average capacity of three different coin cells was used to report capacity/capacitance.
