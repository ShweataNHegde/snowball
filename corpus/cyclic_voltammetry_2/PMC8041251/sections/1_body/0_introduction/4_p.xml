<p>Although the electrochemical reversibility of Zn stripping/deposition was enhanced and Zn dendrite formation was suppressed using WiSEs, the lack of an efficient cathode material for ZIBs remains a severe challenge.

 </sup> Each of these materials suffers from limited specific capacity, far below the theoretical capacity of the Zn anode (820 mAh g
 <sup>–1</sup>), a low-voltage plateau (&lt;1.4 V), and a low rate capability due to their poor electronic conductivity. The low performance of these cathodes is mainly attributed to the high polarization of the divalent Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> ions leading to strong binding with the host lattice and sluggish solid-state migration dynamics.

 </sup> Therefore, the development of efficient cathodes should use different combinations of battery chemistry, for example, reversible deposition and stripping of Zn as the anode half-reaction and reversible atomic intercalation or plating of non-Zn-ion species as the cathode half-reaction. This strategy not only avoids the intercalation of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> to the host cathode material but also allows the flexibility to fine tune and increase the output voltage, which is the main barrier limiting the overall performance.
