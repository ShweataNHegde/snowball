<p>The development of ZIBs is, however, hindered by a number of factors relating to aqueous electrolytes, the formation of Zn dendrites at the anode, and lack of efficient cathode materials.

 </sup> Furthermore, the codecomposition of water molecules during the deposition of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> is known to affect the reversibility of the Zn stripping/deposition and depletes the electrolyte due to the sustained water consumption. Wang et al. used water-in-salt electrolytes (WiSEs) to enhance the electrochemical window of water and obtained dendrite-free Zn plating/stripping with near 100% Coulombic efficiency.

 </sup> WiSEs contain a high concentration of the desired salt so that the hydrated ions outnumber free water: as there is no free water to react at the electrode surface, the overall cell voltage can be increased. The combination of small cations and large fluorinated anions in water alters the hydration behavior of the ions where the cation is strongly solvated, but the anion is not. The less solvated fluorinated anions can be reduced to form a passivating solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on the electrode surface.

 </sup> This SEI formation significantly suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction and is largely responsible for the overall electrochemical stability window of WiSEs.

 </sup> The highest voltage window (4.9 V) recorded at the hydrophobic graphite of WiSEs contains small metal cations (Li
 <sup>+</sup>) and large fluorinated anions such as bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ([TFSI]
 <sup>−</sup>) and trifluoromethanesulfonate ([TFO]
 <sup>−</sup>).
