<p>Aqueous rechargeable batteries are a promising class of batteries for grid-scale electrochemical energy storage owing to their low cost, ease of fabrication, high ionic conductivity, and high operational safety.

 </sup> Research on aqueous batteries in recent years has been gaining momentum from application in low-voltage divalent zinc–ion batteries (ZIB) to high-voltage monovalent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).

 </sup> In particular, ZIBs have attracted substantial interest as one of the most promising next-generation technologies because: (i) they depend on an Earth-abundant metal, which is air-stable unlike Li; (ii) their low cost, safety, and environmental benignancy is attractive for grid-scale energy storage, and (iii) the volumetric energy density is approximately 3 times higher than that of Li.

 </sup> Due to these favorable properties, zinc has been used as an anode material in a series of battery technologies both in conventional static cells (zinc–manganese dioxide batteries, zinc–air batteries, or Zn-graphite dual ion batteries) and in redox flow configurations (Zn–bromine or Zn–iron cells).
