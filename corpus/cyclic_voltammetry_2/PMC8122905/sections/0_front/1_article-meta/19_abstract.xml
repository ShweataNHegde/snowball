 <p>Nanostructured FeS dispersed onto N, S dual-doped carbon nanotube–graphene composite support (FeS/N,S:CNT–GR) was prepared by a simple synthetic method. Annealing an ethanol slurry of Fe precursor, thiourea, carbon nanotube, and graphene oxide at 973 K under N
  <sub>2</sub> atmosphere and subsequent acid treatment produced FeS nanoparticles distributed onto the N, S-doped carbon nanotube–graphene support. The synthesized FeS/N,S:CNT–GR catalyst exhibited significantly enhanced electrochemical performance in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared with bare FeS, FeS/N,S:GR, and FeS/N,S:CNT with a small half-wave potential (0.827 V) in an alkaline electrolyte. The improved ORR performance, comparable to that of commercial Pt/C, could be attributed to synergy between the small FeS nanoparticles with a high activity and the N, S-doped carbon nanotube–graphene composite support providing high electrical conductivity, large surface area, and additional active sites.
