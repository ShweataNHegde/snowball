<p>Crystalline structures of the prepared catalysts were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, pw 3040/60 X’pert diffractometer, Malvern PANalytical, Malvern, UK) with Cu Kα radiation. Structural details were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and energy dispersive microscopy (EDS, Oxford Instruments, x-Max T-80, Abingdon, Oxon, UK). Surface chemical composition and electronic state were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, K-alpha, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and Raman spectroscopy (Alpha300R, WITec, Ulm, Germany). Textural properties were characterized by N
 <sub>2</sub>-sorption isotherms measured at 77 K (Nanoporosity-XQ, Mirae Scientific Instruments, Anyang, Korea). Elemental composition of the prepared catalysts (Fe ratio) was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, 700-ES, Varian, CA, USA).
