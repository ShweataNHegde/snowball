<p>Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized by Hummer’s method [
 <xref rid="B27-materials-14-02146" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and commercial CNT (CMP-301F, Hanwha Nanotech, Incheon, Korea) was acid treated with 90% nitric acid and 99% sulfuric acid solution, 1:3 
 <italic>v/v</italic> ratio, at 393 K for 3 h to eliminate residual metal species before use [
 <xref rid="B28-materials-14-02146" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Typically, GO (116 mg) and CNT (116 mg) were dispersed in 5 mL ethanol. FeCl
 <sub>2</sub>·4H
 <sub>2</sub>O (1 g) was dissolved in 5 mL ethanol and added to the CNT–GO solution. Thiourea (1.5 g) was added to the solution and the solution was stirred for 1 h. The resulting solution was dried in an oven at 373 K to evaporate ethanol and annealed at 973 K (at a heating rate of 10 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup>) for 3 h under N
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere. The sample was stirred in 0.5 M sulfuric acid solution for 30 min to obtain pure, crystalline phase FeS loaded onto the N,S:CNT–GR support. FeS/CNT and FeS/GR were prepared following an identical method except only CNT or GO was included during the synthesis. Bare FeS was synthesized identically without any carbon support. Nominal weight content of FeS in the supported FeS catalysts was fixed to 50%, and measured weight contents (by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, ICP) were 52, 50, and 54 wt% for FeS/N,S:CNT–GR, FeS/N,S:CNT, and FeS/N,S:GR, respectively.
