<p>Electrochemical characteristics were measured in a conventional three electrode cell with N
 <sub>2</sub> or O
 <sub>2</sub> saturated 0.1 M KOH solution, using a potentiostat (Ivium technologies, EIN, The Netherlands) equipped with a rotating disk electrode (Pine research, Durham, NC, USA). Ag/AgCl (3 M NaCl) electrodes and Pt wire were used as reference and counter electrodes, respectively. All potentials were referred to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) without specification. Working electrodes were prepared by dispersing 20 mg catalyst in 2 mL water/ethanol solvent (1:1 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) and 40 µL 5% Nafion solution, and then 20 µL catalyst slurry was pipetted onto a glassy carbon electrode (0.19635 cm
 <sup>2</sup>). Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements were performed at 5 mV/s scan rate of 1600 rpm, measured after 20 cyclic voltammetry tests from 0 to 1.2 V to stabilize the current. Durability was investigated by subjecting the samples to 6000 cycles of repeated potential ramp from 1.2 to 0 V.
