<p>This work successfully prepared a non-precious metal catalyst for ORR comprising FeS nanoparticles dispersed onto N, S dual-doped CNT–GR composite supports through a simple annealing and acid treatment, achieving simultaneous FeS formation and N, S dual-doping into CNT–GR. The synthesized FeS/N,S:CNT–GR catalyst exhibited the highest ORR performance among prepared FeS-based catalysts with a small E
 <sub>1/2</sub> value of 0.827 V, comparable to commercial Pt/C. Improved ORR performance was attributed to a synergy between the small FeS nanoparticles with high activity and N, S dual-doped CNT–GR support providing improved high electrical conductivity, large surface area, and its own ORR performance caused by modified electronic structure by the dual doping. Thus, N,S:CNT–GR composite support mediates FeS growth, reducing particle aggregation, and further increasing reaction sites. This FeS/N,S:CNT–GR catalyst offers a potential non-precious metal ORR catalyst of a high activity with a good stability.
