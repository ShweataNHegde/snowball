<p>The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial for electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices including fuel cells and lithium-air batteries [

 <xref rid="B2-materials-14-02146" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The fuel cell is a promising energy conversion device due to its high energy density, rapid start-up, and zero emissions [

 <xref rid="B4-materials-14-02146" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-materials-14-02146" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. ORR typically occurs at the cathode of fuel cells heavily loaded with platinum [

 <xref rid="B7-materials-14-02146" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], but its high cost, low abundance, and instability have made the fuel cell a highly expensive device [
 <xref rid="B8-materials-14-02146" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Thus, it is essential to develop non-precious metal-based ORR catalysts offering high activity and stability for more rapid dissemination of fuel cells [
