<p>This paper proposes a simple fabrication method for FeS nanoparticles loaded onto the N, S dual-doped CNT–GR support (FeS/N,S:CNT–GR). Nanostructured FeS/N,S:CNT–GR was obtained by simply annealing a mixture of Fe precursor, thiourea, and carbon supports (CNT and graphene oxide (GO)) at 973 K under flowing N
 <sub>2</sub> and subsequent acid treatment for 30 min. The synthesized FeS/N,S:CNT–GR catalyst showed an impressive ORR activity and stability. It offers various merits in terms of synthesis and ORR performance: (1) The proposed fabrication method is simple and economical. FeS crystallization, reduction of GO to GR, and N, S dual-doping into the CNT–GR support were simultaneously achieved in one-pot reactions under N
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere. Unlike previous reports, no further chemicals for GO reduction and N, S dual-doping or toxic gas for FeS crystallization are required. (2) Our FeS/N,S:CNT–GR catalyst exhibits one of the best performances among the iron-based TMS catalysts, with small onset and half-wave potential values of 0.972 and 0.827 V, respectively, and a good stability for 6000 potential cycling. The high ORR activity of FeS/N,S:CNT–GR is probably due to synergy between active FeS nanoparticles and the N, S dual-doped CNT–GR support providing large surface area and high electrical conductivity of the catalyst. The N,S:CNT–GR by itself further stimulates ORR performance through the N, S dual doping, and mediates FeS growth to mitigate particle aggregation. Thus, considering the simple fabrication method and the high ORR performance, FeS/N,S:CNT–GR could be a promising non-precious metal electrocatalyst for ORR.
