 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02146-f004">Figure 4</xref>c shows LSV curves for FeS/N,S:CNT–GR after 6000 potential cycles between 1.2 and 0 V. Activity loss for FeS/N,S:CNT–GR was marginal with slightly decreased E
 <sub>1/2</sub> = 0.821 V from 0.827 V, whereas commercial Pt/C recorded a 30 mV decrease in E
 <sub>1/2</sub>. Similarly, the current loss for the FeS/N,S:CNT–GR was ~6% after continuous operation for 10,000 s at 0.7 V (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02146-f004">Figure 4</xref>d), whereas commercial Pt/C showed much faster current decay of 27%, indicating that our FeS/N,S:CNT has a high ORR activity comparable to Pt/C, and much better ORR stability than Pt/C.
