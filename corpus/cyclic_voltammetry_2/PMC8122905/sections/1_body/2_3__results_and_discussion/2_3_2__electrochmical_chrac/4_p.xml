<p>This excellent ORR activity and stability of the FeS/N,S:CNT–GR catalyst could arise from synergy between small FeS nanoparticles and the N, S dual-doped CNT–GR support. The N,S:CNT–GR support provides a high electrical conductivity and a large surface area, improving FeS activity and electrolyte contact to active sites (FeS). Indeed, in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-14-02146">Figure S6</xref>, FeS/N,S:CNT–GR achieved considerably higher double layer capacitance C
 <sub>dl</sub> of 36.6 mF/cm
 <sup>2</sup> compared with FeS/N,S:GR, FeS/N,S:CNT, and bare FeS (C
 <sub>dl</sub> values of 10.5, 24.6, and 1.16 mF/cm
 <sup>2</sup>, respectively) [
 <xref rid="B46-materials-14-02146" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The C
 <sub>dl</sub> value is proportional to contact area between electrode and electrolyte (or electrochemical surface area, ECSA), hence the N,S:CNT–GR support efficiently increases the contact area, alleviating CNT bundling and GR layers stacking [

 <xref rid="B39-materials-14-02146" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Furthermore, simultaneous N and S-doping to CNT–GR was easily achieved by employing thiourea, improving the ORR performance by redistributing spin and charge densities [

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-14-02146">Figure S7</xref> shows that the N, S dual-doped CNT–GR prepared by identical synthetic methods without Fe precursor has its own ORR activity, achieving E
 <sub>1/2</sub> of 0.762 V. Hence, combining it with FeS considerably improved ORR activity of the FeS/N,S:CNT–GR catalyst, indicating a synergy between FeS and N,S:CNT–GR. Thus, considering the facile synthetic method and high ORR performance, FeS/N,S:CNT–GR catalysts constitute a potential candidate to substitute commercial Pt/C catalyst.
