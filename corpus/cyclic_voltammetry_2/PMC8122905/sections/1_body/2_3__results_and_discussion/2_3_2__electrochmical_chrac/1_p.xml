 <sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1M KOH solution. Benchmark commercial 20% Pt/C (Johnson–Matthey) achieved the best ORR performance with higher onset potential E
 <sub>onset</sub> = 1.0 V and half-wave potential E
 <sub>1/2</sub> = 0.84 V than others. The FeS/N,S:CNT–GR catalyst showed comparable performance to Pt/C, but outperformed the other FeS catalysts in ORR activity. Thus, Eonset values were 0.923, 0.931, and 0.972 V for FeS/N,S:GR, FeS/N,S:CNT, and FeS/N,S:CNT–GR, respectively. The E
 <sub>1/2</sub> value for FeS/N,S:CNT–GR (0.827 V) was higher than FeS/N,S:CNT (0.808 V) and FeS/N,S:GR (0.800 V). Bare FeS showed poor ORR activity with an Eonset of 0.8 V and E
 <sub>1/2</sub> of 0.58 V. Thus, carbon supports enhanced ORR activity substantially, demonstrating their critical importance, providing high conductivity and large surface area for the loaded FeS nanoparticles. Besides, dual N, S-doping to the carbon supports further enhanced the activity due to changing the charge distribution in the carbon framework and improving electrical conductivity compared with undoped carbon supports [
