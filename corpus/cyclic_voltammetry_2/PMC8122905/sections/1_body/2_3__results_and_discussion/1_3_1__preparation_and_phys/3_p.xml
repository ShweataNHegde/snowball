 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02146-f001">Figure 1</xref>a shows a lattice spacing of 0.299 nm corresponding to the FeS (100) plane. Bare FeS particles were aggregated forming large clusters with approximately 700 nm diameter. In contrast, substantially reduced particle aggregation occurs for carbon-supported FeS catalysts, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02146-f001">Figure 1</xref>b–d, with much smaller FeS nanoparticles (20–30 nm) distributed on each carbon support. Metal precursors are attracted by oxygen-containing functional groups within the carbon supports (CNT and GO). Hence FeS particles grow selectively on carbon supports (CNT, GR, and CNT–GR). Strong coupling between FeS particles and carbon supports mitigates FeS nanoparticle aggregation, e.g., 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02146-f001">Figure 1</xref>b shows FeS nanoparticles (28 nm) anchored on CNT without severe aggregation. No free-standing particles occurred, indicating that the CNT support mediated FeS growth and suppressed particle aggregation.

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-14-02146">Figure S2</xref>) show that Fe, S, and N overlap with C, suggesting FeS nanoparticles are dispersed on the N, S-doped CNT–GR support.
