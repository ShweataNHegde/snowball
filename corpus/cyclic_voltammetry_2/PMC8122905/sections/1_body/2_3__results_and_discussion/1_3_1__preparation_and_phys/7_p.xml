 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02146-f003">Figure 3</xref>a shows that carbon-supported FeS samples exhibited the type IV isotherm with a typical hysteresis of the isotherms, indicating the presence of mesopores, whereas bare FeS does not show clear hysteresis. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area for bare FeS was 14 m

 <sup>−1</sup> after introducing the N,S:CNT–GR support. FeS/N,S:CNT and FeS/N,S:GR also showed increased BET surface areas of 174 and 137 m
 <sup>2</sup>g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. The larger surface area of FeS/N,S:CNT–GR compared with FeS/N,S:CNT and FeS/N,S:GR was due to a synergy between CNT and GR acting as spacers for each other, alleviating CNT’s bundling and GR layers’ stacking [

 <sup>3</sup>/g) &gt; FeS/N,S:GR (0.4077 cm
 <sup>3</sup>/g). The large surface area with abundant mesopores will stabilize smaller FeS nanoparticles, leading to improved catalytic activity for ORR [
