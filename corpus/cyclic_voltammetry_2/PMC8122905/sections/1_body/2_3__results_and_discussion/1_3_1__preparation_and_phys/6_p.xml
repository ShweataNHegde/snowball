<p>Chemical states of FeS/CNT–GR were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02146-f002">Figure 2</xref>c shows high resolution Fe 2p XPS spectra for FeS/CNT–GR. The peaks centered around 710.1 and 723.5 eV are due to Fe

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02146-f002">Figure 2</xref>d shows N 1s spectra, with peaks at 398.5, 399.6, 401.1, and 403.8 eV corresponding to pyridinic, pyrrolic, graphitic, and oxidized N species, respectively [

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-14-02146">Figure S3a</xref> shows high resolution S 2p XPS spectra for FeS/N,S:CNT–GR, which could be deconvoluted into five peaks. Peaks at 161.2 and 162.8eV are related to S

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-14-02146">Figure S3b</xref>), FeS-related peaks disappeared while the peaks attributed to polysulfide S in the carbon plane and sulphate species were maintained. The results indicate that the thiourea was the sulfur source for FeS crystallization and S-doping to the carbon supports. 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-14-02146">Figure S4</xref> shows XPS spectra for FeS/N,S:CNT and FeS/N,S:GR. They exhibit similar Fe 2p, N 1s, and S 2p peaks to FeS/N,S:CNT–GR, suggesting similar chemical states of FeS for all the carbon-supported catalysts.
