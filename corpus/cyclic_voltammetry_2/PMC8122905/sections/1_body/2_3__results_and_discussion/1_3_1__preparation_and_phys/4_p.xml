 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02146-f002">Figure 2</xref>a shows XRD patterns for prepared catalysts. Common peaks at 30°, 34°, 43°, and 52° can be indexed to hexagonal FeS (JCPDS 03-065-3408). Carbon-supported FeS samples show broad peaks at 26°, originating from CNT or GR. As mentioned, impurity peaks such as Fe
 <sub>x</sub>C or Fe
 <sub>x</sub>N were not present after acid treatment.
