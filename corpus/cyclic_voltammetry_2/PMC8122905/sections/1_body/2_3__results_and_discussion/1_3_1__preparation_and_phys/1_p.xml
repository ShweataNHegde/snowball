 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="materials-14-02146-sch001">Scheme 1</xref> shows the schematic fabrication procedure for bare and carbon-supported FeS catalysts. For FeS/N,S:CNT–GR, iron precursor reacts with ethanol to form Fe-ethoxide and was then mixed with CNT–GO in ethanol solution. Fe-thiourea complex was generated on the CNT–GO support by adding thiourea, and a powder product was obtained by annealing the Fe-thiourea complex/CNT–GO at 973 K for 3 h under flowing N
 <sub>2</sub>. The annealing produced mixed FeS, Fe
 <sub>x</sub>C, and Fe
 <sub>x</sub>N crystalline phases (

 <sub>x</sub>C and Fe
 <sub>x</sub>N phases disappeared after the acid treatment, leaving pure FeS phase due to better chemical stability of FeS under acid solution than Fe
 <sub>x</sub>C and Fe
 <sub>x</sub>N. Crystallization of FeS and reduction of GO to GR proceeded simultaneously during annealing. The N and S-doping into CNT–GR supports was also achieved using thiourea as a source of N and S. This synthetic procedure produced FeS nanoparticles with an average size of 24 nm dispersed on CNT–GR supports. Other carbon-supported FeS catalysts, FeS/N,S:CNT, and FeS/N,S:GR, were prepared following the same synthetic method employed with either CNT or GO, exclusively. Bare FeS was also similarly prepared without carbon support. The CNT–GR hybrid support can provide a large surface area for enhanced contact between FeS nanoparticles and electrolyte [
