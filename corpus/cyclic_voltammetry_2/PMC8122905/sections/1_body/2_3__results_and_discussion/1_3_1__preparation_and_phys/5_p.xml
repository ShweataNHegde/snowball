 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02146-f002">Figure 2</xref>b shows Raman spectra from the prepared catalysts. Intense peaks occur at 1350 (D) and 1580 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (G) and the numbers indicate their intensity ratios, i.e., I
 <sub>D</sub>/I
 <sub>G</sub> ratios [
 <xref rid="B33-materials-14-02146" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The D peak is related to sp
 <sup>2</sup> ring disorder or defects, and the G peak to first order scattering from sp
 <sup>2</sup> domains E
 <sub>2g</sub> mode. I
 <sub>D</sub>/I
 <sub>G</sub> measures the degree of disorder, where increased I
 <sub>D</sub>/I
 <sub>G</sub> implies sp
 <sup>2</sup> carbon restoration and smaller sp
 <sup>2</sup> domains due to GO reduction [
 <xref rid="B34-materials-14-02146" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Thus, the increased I
 <sub>D</sub>/I
 <sub>G</sub> ratio in the FeS/GR (1.191) and the FeS/CNT–GR (1.190) compared with of GO (0.937) verifies thermal reduction of GO to GR during the synthesis.
