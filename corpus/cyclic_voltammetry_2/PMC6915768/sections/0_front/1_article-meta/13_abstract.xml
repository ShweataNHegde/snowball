 <p id="Par1">Herein, we propose a facile electrochemical approach for the synthesis of Pd loaded poly 3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT) electrodeposited on glassy carbon electrode (GCE) resulting in high surface area. The catalyst preparation is initiated with EDOT polymerization on GCE surface by electrochemical potential cycling method, followed by the electrodeposition of Cu from a 2 mM solution of CuSO
