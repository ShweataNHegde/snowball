<p id="Par6">The Cu/PEDOT electrode was subjected to the galvanic replacement reaction and the Cu NPs were replaced by Pd NPs. The Cu/PEDOT electrode was kept immersed in different concentrations (0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 mM) of Palladium chloride (PdCl
 <sub>2</sub>) solutions for 30 minutes without any disturbance. After 30 minutes, the electrode was washed with Milli-Q water and was then allowed to dry for few minutes.
