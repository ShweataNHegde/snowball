 </sup> and as mentioned in section 2.2. Briefly electropolymerisation was carried out on a well-polished and cleaned GC electrode from a 0.02 M EDOT (3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene monomer) dissolved in 100 ml of a 0.05 M solution of TBAClO
 <sub>4</sub> (tetrabutyl ammonium perchlorate) in acetonitrile. Potential cycling (20 segments) was conducted between the potentials −0.65 V and +1.25 V

 <sup>+</sup>/Ag reference electrode. A Pt foil was used as the counter electrode. Subsequent to polymerization, the GC electrode was rinsed completely with acetonitrile. Cu was electrodeposited on GC/PEDOT in the form of nanoparticles (NPs) at a constant potential of +0.34 V 
 <italic>vs</italic>. SHE (120 s of deposition) from a 0.002 M solution of CuSO
 <sub>4</sub> in 0.1 M NaClO
 <sub>4</sub> solution. The Milli-Q water (ρ = 18.2 MΩ cm) was used to prepare the electrolyte solution. The mass of electrodeposited Cu was calculated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The Cu NPs were partially replaced by Pd by galvanic displacement reaction (GDR) by immersing the Cu NP modified PEDOT/GC electrode for 30 min in PdCl
 <sub>2</sub> solutions of different concentrations. The galvanic replacement phenomenon was confirmed by CV in 0.5 M of H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>. The charge, mass and electroactive surface area (EASA) of Pd-Cu PEDOT/GC were calculated from CV data. The same procedure was repeated for different concentrations of PdCl
 <sub>2</sub>. Thus fabricated Pd/PEDOT/GC electrocatalyst was used to study the methanol tolerant oxygen reduction reaction. The potential values are stated with reference to SHE or Ag
 <sup>+</sup>/Ag in the graphs presented in this manuscript.
