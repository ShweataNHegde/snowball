<p id="Par8">A CHI 1000 A (Electro Analytical System) was employed for electropolymerisation of EDOT by sequential potential cycling, controlled potential deposition of Cu and for the estimation of Pd content by CV. Oxygen reduction reaction was examined by rotating disk electrode (RDE) and rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) supplied by Pine instrument. Morphological details were estimated by various techniques as described us earlier

 </sup>. The information related to the structure and size of the Pd/PEDOT/GC and Cu/PEDOT/GC catalysts were obtained by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (FEI Tecnai 20 G2). X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies were conducted by preparing the nanostructured catalyst on a ITO substrate, by following the same method with a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Ni-filtered Cu K
 <sub>α</sub> radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) at the scan rate of 3°/min in steps of 0.05°. The percentage of Pd and Cu on PEDOT was investigated by EDAX (Hitachi S-3000H scanning electron microscope) and the distribution of Cu and Pd on PEDOT was examined by a Carl Zeiss field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Supra 55 VP). The chemical states of the elements were determined by a Multilab 2000 Thermo Scientific X-ray photoelectron spectrophotometer (XPS) using a twin anode X-ray source (Mg K
 <sub>α</sub> radiation, 1253.6 eV). The XPS spectra were curve fitted and de-convoluted with XPS peak 4.1 software. The topography image was recorded by scanning probe microscopy Agilent technology (5500 series) and the image was processed by pico image basic software.
