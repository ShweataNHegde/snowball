<p id="Par4">The GC electrode was subjected to pre-treatment by polishing on alumina slurry using emery cloth followed by sonication in acetone + water mixture and water respectively. After the pre-treatment, the cleaned GC electrode was dried under vacuum. Then the dried GC electrode was investigated by cyclic voltammetry in the scan range from 0.0 V to 1.4 V

The 20 mM of EDOT monomer was prepared in 50 ml of acetonitrile and 50 mM of tetrabutyl ammonium perchlorate and was used for electropolymerization. The EDOT was electrochemically polymerised on GC electrode by cyclic voltammetry between the potential limits −0.65 V and 1.25 V
