<p id="Par32">Pd/PEDOT catalyst was prepared on a glassy carbon surface by initially depositing Cu nanocubes on PEDOT surface under constant potential followed by the formation of Pd on Cu by GDR (galvanic displacement reaction). Superior methanol tolerance property has been observed for this Pd/PEDOT electrocatalyst. This catalyst, favours water formation via hydrogen peroxide production in 0.5â€‰M H

 <sub>2</sub> which undergoes fast chemical decomposition to water. This paper brings out the catalytic activity of the galvanically replaced Pd nanostructures on PEDOT surface. The morphological analysis carried out during each stage of modification by FE-SEM and TEM analysis, showed a clear transition from porous morphology of PEDOT to nanocube formation of Cu on PEDOT followed by Pd deposit on Cu nanocubes by GDR in the form of uniform agglomeration of Pd nanoparticles with shrimp like structure. Thus prepared electrocatalyst can be used as methanol resistant fuel cell cathode. This concept can open a new avenue to create similar type of catalysts from other Pt group metals with definite structural morphology on polymer matrix for applications in sensing and catalysis using electrochemical approach.
