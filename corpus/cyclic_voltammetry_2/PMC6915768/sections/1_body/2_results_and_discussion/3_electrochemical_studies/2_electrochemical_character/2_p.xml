<p id="Par22">The controlled potential deposition and formation of Cu on PEDOT has been analysed by cyclic voltammetry which has been shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a,b</xref> respectively. The redox features of Cu appears at 0.36 V on the anodic side and at 0.15 V on the cathodic side. The peak separation between the cathodic and anodic peaks is found to be 0.21 V. The mass of Cu deposited on PEDOT was calculated from cyclic voltammetric data by integrating the charge corresponding to the reduction peak of Cu, and was found to be 4.9354 × 10
