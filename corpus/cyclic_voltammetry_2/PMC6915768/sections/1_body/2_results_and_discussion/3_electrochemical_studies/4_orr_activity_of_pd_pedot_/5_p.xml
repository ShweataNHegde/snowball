<p id="Par29">The performance of Pd based catalysts prepared using different supporting matrices have been compared and the results are given in TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The onset potential obtained by us is on par with Pd catalysts prepared using activated carbon supports. It is observed from the table that the inclusion of second metal either as alloy or bimetallic form has shifted the onset potentials to more positive values equivalent to that of Pt/C commercial catalysts. Hence we propose to introduce the second metal also into this Pd/PEDOT matrix by galvanic replacement in future studies.
