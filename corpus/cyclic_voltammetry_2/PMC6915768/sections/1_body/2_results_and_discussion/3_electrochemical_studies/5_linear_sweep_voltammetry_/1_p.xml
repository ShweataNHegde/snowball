<p id="Par30">Pd/PEDOT/GC electrode shows a significant enhancement of the cathodic peak indicating the high electrocatalytic activity of the Pd/PEDOT/GC electrocatalyst (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12a</xref>). The directly deposited Pd on PEDOT/GC (control experiment) could show only a lower electrocatalytic activity towards ORR in the absence of Cu template. The galvanically replaced Pd/PEDOT/GC has provided favourable electroactive sites, resulting in more favourable electron transfer kinetics and enhanced electrocatalytic performance towards oxygen reduction in the Pd/PEDOT/GC electrode. Interestingly the galvanically replaced Pd/PEDOT catalyst exhibits the onset potential at 0.728 V 
 <italic>vs</italic>. SHE and the half wave potential occurs at 0.345 V. The mass and specific activities of the Pd/PEDOT catalyst have been calculated as 1.78 A/g and 1009.48 µA/cm
