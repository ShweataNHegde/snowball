<p id="Par14">The morphologies of (a) GC, (b) PEDOT, (c) Cu-PEDOT, and (d) Pd/PEDOT were characterised by FESEM. The cleaned GC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>) surface indicates the absence of catalyst and the electropolymerized EDOT (PEDOT) on GC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>) surface reveals the 3D porous network structure of PEDOT. The electrochemically deposited Cu on PEDOT (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>) resembles cube like structure and the formation of Cu cubes strongly depends on the time, concentration and number of cycles during electrochemical PEDOT deposition. The size of the Cu nano cubes varies from 63 to 152 nm. The Pd/PEDOT/GC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>) prepared by galvanic replacement reaction of Cu by Pd, shows mosaic pattern resembling shrimp fish. Closely placed spherical Pd NPs knitted in the shape of shrimp fish is observed in the case of Pd/PEDOT/GC. It could be observed that Pd replaces the top layer of Cu atoms on Cu nanocubes on PEDOT matrix and takes the shape of nanorods.
