<p id="Par16">Morphological textures of Cu-PEDOT and Pd/PEDOT were investigated by TEM analysis. The Cu-PEDOT depicted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref> shows the three dimensional structure of Cu nanocubes on PEDOT matrix, and Pd nanoparticles are displayed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>. The formation of tiny sphere shaped Pd nanoparticles have the size of 2.8 to 8.5 nm range as depicted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref> (inset image). The agglomerated Pd nanoparticles stretch over a length of 200 nm resembling a shrimp and it reveals the homogeneous distribution of Pd NPs on Cu/PEDOT matrix.
