<p id="Par17">The TEM-SAED pattern depicted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref> shows the cubic diffraction of Cu on PEDOT with (220), (020), (200), (−220), (−2–20), (−200), and (0–20) planes of Cu. The agglomerated polynomial Pd pattern (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>) with a homogenous distribution of Pd nanoparticles is clearly displayed as a ring arising from the diffraction pattern of (111), (200), and (220) planes of Pd respectively.
