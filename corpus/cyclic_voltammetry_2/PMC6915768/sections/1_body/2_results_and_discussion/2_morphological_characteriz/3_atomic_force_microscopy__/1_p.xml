<p id="Par18">Surface morphology, thickness and roughness of the electrodes have been studied by AFM analysis. The topography of the modified electrode surface shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref> displays the electrochemical intercalation of PEDOT with high surface roughness that can act as a gateway for the allocation of Cu
 <sup>2+</sup>ions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). The electrodeposition of Cu on PEDOT has less roughness factor compared to PEDOT. The galvanically replaced Pd/PEDOT shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref> shows relatively a high surface roughness (
 <italic>Ra</italic>) and root mean square (
 <italic>Rq</italic>) compared to Cu-PEDOT. The increased surface roughness shows the adherence of Pd on Cu revealing the union of two surfaces.
