<p id="Par10">The vibrational bands at 1209 and 1089 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> are ascribed to the C-O-C stretching vibrations in ethylenedioxy group. The C-S band stretching in thiophene ring appeared at the absorption bands at 813 and 678 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The vibrational bands at 939 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> is due to the ethylene dioxy ring deformation mode. The Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> corresponding to Cu NPs functionalized polymer matrix, reveals that the peak corresponding to dioxy group is missing which shows that the Cu is complexed at the oxygen site. A marginal change is observed in the C-S region, indicating only insignificant complexation of Cu atoms at the Sulphur site. In the case of the Pd NPs decorated PEDOT/GCE the intensity of the peaks increased due to the doping of Pd NPs as shown in Fig.
