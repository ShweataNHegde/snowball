<p id="Par12">The chemical composition of Pd/PEDOT is determined by XPS analysis. The composite catalyst shows the presence of the elements Pd, Cu, O, and C. The Gaussian-Lorentzian fitting has been used for deconvolution of Pd 3d, Cu 2p, O 2 s, and C 1 s, respectively. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> depicts the survey spectrum of the prepared catalyst where core level photo emissions for even trace level impurities are also detectable. The O 1 s appears at approximately 532.85 eV but Pd 3p
 <sub>3/2</sub> is also present in the same region. Hence O 2 S peaks are taken into consideration. The high resolution profile of Pd 3d depicted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> shows the pair of asymmetric peaks constituting the Pd 3d signal. The binding energies (BEs) of Pd 3d
 <sub>3/2</sub> (342.43 eV) are 5.22 eV lower than those of Pd 3d
 <sub>5/2</sub> (337.19 eV) for each doublet

 </sup>. The intense doublet peaks belong to Pd (0) and the weak peaks are attributed to Pd (II) species, such as Pd (OH) 
 <sub>2</sub> and PdO.
