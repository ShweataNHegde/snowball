<p id="Par13">The peak of Cu can be clearly seen at 930.74 eV in the high-resolution spectrum of Cu in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>, which indicates distinct distributions of four Cu valence states; that is, the signals observed at 926.31 eV, 930.74 eV, 934.83 eV, and 941.98 eV correspond to Cu
 <sup>+</sup>, Cu
 <sup>2+</sup>, Cu(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> and Cu respectively. The feature at 930.74 eV can be due to Cu
 <sup>+</sup> or metallic Cu. The C 1 s bond can be deconvoluted into three bands at 284.6 eV, 285.9 eV and 287.2 eV, which can be assigned to C=C, C-N (C=N) and C-O (C=O), respectively.
