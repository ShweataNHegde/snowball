<p id="Par10">After deconvolution of the high-resolution spectrum of N1s, two characteristic types of bonds were determined for nitrogen in the form of pyrrolic-N and quaternary-N in binding energies of 399.1 eV and 400.8 eV, respectively

 </sup>. Modified graphene structures subjected to microwave heating facilitated nitrogen substitution in the graphite plane. The effect of high carbonization temperatures on doped structures was the formation of mainly quaternary-N functional groups, responsible for the materials’ effective catalytic activity in the oxygen reduction reaction

 </sup>. Due to access to an electron pair in the graphene structure, the pyrolytic N-group is active in response to the oxygen reduction reaction, which leads to an increase in the catalytic activity of N-doped materials

 </sup>. The overall content of nitrogen atoms for all samples in the 1A-T series was between 0.6 and 2.7 at.%. The XPS results show that nitrogen doping in graphene is successful; there were two characteristic types of nitrogen functional groups that improved catalytic properties in response to ORR results, the highest content belonging to the pyrrolic-N groups. Deconvolution of the high-resolution O1s spectrum fit into three bands at energy values of 531.6 eV, 533.2 eV, and 536.0 eV which correspond to C–O–C, O–C–O, and absorbed H
 <sub>2</sub>O bonds, respectively
