<p id="Par8">In order to determine the thickness and lateral size of graphene sheets which were treated in the microwave reactor, AFM analysis was performed using the 1A-T and 1B-T series of samples, synthesized in two solvents, EtOH (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a) and DMF (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). Knowing the thickness of single-layered graphene and the interlayer distance, the measured value corresponds to few graphene layers. The thickness of graphene sheets for series 1A-T and 1B-T is in the range of 3.62–6.78 nm and 5.59–16.45 nm, respectively. This result is consistent with Raman spectroscopy examinations, which also suggests that employing the microwave reactor produces few-layered graphene, regardless of the type of solvent.
