<p id="Par6">A basic premise of this method of enriching the final material with nitrogen is the use of green algae. After carbonization, it can join graphene flakes (single layer graphene, few layer graphene and multilayer graphene type) into a durable, porous 3D structure resembling a foam or sponge. Aside from providing amorphous carbon matter adhering graphene flakes, green algae is a source of nitrogen. It was selected due to its useful features, such as ease of mixing with graphene flakes in EtOH or DMF and thermal degradation to a non-porous nitrogen-rich matrix. A low carbon matrix yield from the starting green algae mass makes it possible to avoid soaking the graphene flakes and retains the graphene flakes’ surface accessibility to chemical reagents, e.g., electrolytes. The green algae-originated carbon phase is assumed to be present in the form N-rich bridges between graphene flakes which enable electron transfer throughout the whole mass of material. The effective exfoliation of materials obtained with a holding time of 10 min in the reactor led to the investigation of the effect that extending holding time had on the structure and elemental composition of graphene foams. The influence on the nitrogen content was examined in two different electrolytes, while the carbonization process was used to change the structure of graphene by creating exfoliated graphene foam with embedded nitrogen functional groups. The elemental analysis was used to determine the composition of the N-doped graphene foams. The influence of the elemental composition for materials in series 0A/B-T and 1A/B-T obtained in different solvents is shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The results for samples obtained in these two series indicate that solvent and holding time in the microwave reactor influence the elemental content of the obtained materials. A high carbon content in the range from 76.06 to 95.52 wt% was observed for all samples. The mass content of the samples obtained was typical for graphene-based materials. The nitrogen content in samples prepared without N-reagent was significantly lower than that for samples with

For samples synthesized in different solvents with N-reagent, the percentage by mass of nitrogen was high, at 2.44 wt% for the 1A-10 sample. Along with extending the reaction time for the 1A-T series produced in the ethyl alcohol solvent, a significant decrease of the nitrogen content, down to 0.65 wt%, was noted. In the case of the 1B-T series, where DMF was the solvent, an increase in the samples’ nitrogen content was observed when holding time was increased. The highest nitrogen content for the 1B-T series was recorded for a sample maintained for 90 min, at 0.89 wt%.
