<p id="Par9">The surface elemental composition of materials from the 1A-T series was analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a shows a wide survey scan for sample 1A-30 collected from 0 to 1300 eV. XPS spectra of sample 1A-30 for C1s, N1s, and O1s are presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b–d. The high-resolution spectrum of C1s (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b) can be deconvoluted into five peaks centered at 284.6 eV, 285.0 eV, 286.4 eV, 287.7 eV, and 288.6 eV, which can be attributed to bonds of C=C (sp
 <sup>2</sup>), C–C (sp
 <sup>3</sup>), C–O–C, C=O, and O–C=O, respectively. The total content of carbon for all samples, determined by XPS measurement, was in the range from 90.2 to 93.2 at.% (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) and was at the same level as carbon content determined by elemental combustion measurement.
