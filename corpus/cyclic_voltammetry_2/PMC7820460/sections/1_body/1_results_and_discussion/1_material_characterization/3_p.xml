 </sup> respectively. Using Raman spectroscopy analysis, it is possible to estimate the number of graphene sheet layers that have been laid, as well as determine defects in the material obtained. Raman spectra were compiled for the N-doped graphene foams carried out in two selected solvents, EtOH (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a) and DMF (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). The holding time in the reactor was 10, 30, 60, or 90 min. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> shows the ratio of intensities of the materials obtained depending on their different reaction times and solvents. The ratio of D and G band intensities indicates the degree of graphitization defect, while I
 <sub>2D</sub>/I
 <sub>G</sub> indicates the number of superimposed graphene layers. Comparing the spectra with each other, there is no significant difference in the intensity ratio of 2D to G bands. The ratio is close to 0.5, which indicates that the obtained material possesses several layers. The change in D-band is clearly visible, which may mark the quality of the graphene structure. In the 1A-T series, the I
 <sub>D</sub>/I
 <sub>G</sub> band ratio increases along with the reaction time, indicating quality. The low ratio of D to G-band intensities suggests that graphene material was effectively obtained. These can potentially be used in electrochemical applications as electrodes, as sensors, or biosensors.
