<p id="Par5">The proposed method to obtain N-doped graphene foam using a pressure microwave reactor was confirmed to be effective using instrumental methods. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the commercial expanded graphite, the substrate for synthesis. The morphology of expanded graphite is flat and graphite sheets overlap in stacks. The scanning electron microscope images allow determining the impact of the microwave process and type of solvent on the structure of the obtained graphene materials. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the structure of materials obtained in the EtOH solution for samples 0A-10 and 1A-10. For material obtained without the carbonization process, the structure is similar to pristine graphite with the layers not separated (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). The HRTEM images in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b indicate that the material consisted of many graphene sheets forming thick stacked layers. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c,d show SEM and HRTEM images of graphene foams obtained with N-reagent. The carbonization process aided the exfoliation of graphene flakes. The SEM and HRTEM images for samples obtained in DMF are presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a,b for the 0B-10 sample and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c,d for the 1B-10 sample. The morphology of the materials obtained in DMF is very similar to that of materials obtained in EtOH, so further analysis was necessary. In all solvents, the material was exfoliated after carbonization to form graphene foam, creating very light and fluffy structures. The high temperature caused the creation of spaces and a system of very thin graphene walls which incorporated nitrogen atoms. The HRTEM images for all solvents indicate that in both cases very thin parallel layers can be observed. Disordered morphology and clearly overlapping layers are typical for graphene-based materials.
