<p id="Par3">Graphene foams, due to their excellent porous structure, are a light material that combines the properties of two-dimensional graphene sheets and the three-dimensional system they form when joined together. The large pore volume and subsequent high specific surface area of the material, its thermal stability, high electronic conductivity, and high ion transfer rate all contribute to graphene foams’ functionality in energy storage devices
