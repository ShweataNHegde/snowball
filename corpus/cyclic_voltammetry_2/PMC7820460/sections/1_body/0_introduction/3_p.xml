<p id="Par4">The synthesis of any metal-free but electrochemically active electrode material is an important contribution to protecting the environment and the key motivation for engaging this research approach. To this end, we present a fast and facile method of producing N-doped graphene foam using a microwave process. In the proposed process, expanded graphite was used as a starting material and green algae 
 <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> as an N-precursor. Different solvents (ethyl alcohol and dimethylformamide) were applied in the microwave reactor study. After the microwave process, the samples were carbonized. The study investigated the influence that the microwave (duration time) and carbonization processes had on graphene structure and nitrogen content.
