<p id="Par13">The production of N-doped graphene foams was based on a one-step process using microwave radiation in two dispersed solvents: ethyl alcohol (EtOH), and dimethylformamide (DMF). The starting materials used were expanded commercial graphite (EG, Sinograf, Torun, Poland) and the natural green algae N-precursor, 
 <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic>. The compounds were mixed in a solvent with a 1:4 mass ratio of graphene to 
 <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic>, then sonicated to obtain a better dispersion. The samples were loaded into a microwave reactor (Microwave 400) and heated under pressure to 180 °C, with the power of about 300–600 W. The microwaving duration was either 10, 30, 60, or 90 min; after this time, the samples were stirred. The obtained mass was then washed with distilled water to remove the solvent and dried at 120 °C overnight. Finally, samples were carbonized at 900 °C with a heating rate of 3 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> and then heated for 4 h under the flow of nitrogen (to provide an inert environment during carbonization). Reference samples were made using the same procedure, but without the addition of an N-precursor nor the carbonization process. For all samples without the addition of 
 <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic>, the process in the reactor was maintained for 10 min. The reference samples obtained without carbonization, only the microwave process, are designated as 0A/B-T, where A and B describe the solvent and denote EtOH or DMF, respectively, while T is the time in minutes that the sample was held in the microwave reactor. Samples obtained with the addition of the N-precursor and using carbonization are designated as 1A/B-T, where A and B describe the solvent and mark EtOH or DMF, respectively, and T is the duration of time spent in the microwave.
