<p id="Par14">The atomic structure of the obtained materials was analyzed using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM FEI Tecnai F20 X-Twin, Brno, Czech Republic) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. A scanning electron microscope operating at 30 kV (SEM, 1430 VP, LEO Electron Microscopy Ltd., Oberkochen, Germany) was used to determine the structure of the samples. The elemental composition of the materials was analyzed by means of a combustion elemental analyzer (Vario MACRO CHN, Elementar Analysensysteme GmbH, Langenselbold, Germany). Raman-microscopic spectroscopy analysis was performed using Renishaw InVia (Renishaw Company, Gloucestershire, the United Kingdom), excitation wavelength 532 nm at an ambient temperature. Nitrogen sorption isotherms were determined through nitrogen physisorption at 77 K in a volumetric apparatus ASAP 2010 (Micromeritics, Norcross, GA, USA). The attachment, bonding configuration, and compositional analysis of the material was carried out by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements (XPS, PHI5000 VersaProbe II Scanning XPS Microprobe, Chigasaki, Japan). A monochromatic Al-Kα X-ray (1486.6 eV) was used as the operating excitation source. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) investigations were conducted using a Scanning Probe Microscope (SPM) apparatus produced by Veeco (Digital Instrument, USA), working under ambient conditions.</p>
