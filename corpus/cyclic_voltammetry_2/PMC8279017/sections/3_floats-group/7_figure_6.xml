  <p>Cycling trends with Coulombic efficiency (right 
   <italic>y</italic>-axis) related to (a) Li/DEGDME_HCE/S:Sn 80:20 and (b) Li/TREGDME_HCE/LFP cells galvanostatically cycled at 1C (1675 mA g
   <sub>S</sub>
   <sup>–1</sup>) and C/3 (1C = 170 mA g
   <sup>–1</sup>), respectively. The Li/S cell was cycled at 35 °C by exploiting an electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 20 μL mg
   <sup>–1</sup> and a 1.6–2.8 V voltage range. The Li/LFP cell was cycled at room temperature (25 °C) by employing a 1.2–3.9 V voltage range for the first cycle and voltage limits of 2.7 and 3.9 V for the subsequent ones.
