<p>Herein, we originally extend the investigation of these highly concentrated electrolyte media to different cathode chemistries which can be employed in new configurations of lithium–metal batteries, that is, the ones using the conversion electrochemical process related to sulfur

 </sup> Therefore, the present study focuses on the electrochemical performances of the new electrolytes in advanced lithium cells using the high-performance sulfur composite with low amount of electrochemically inactive, conductive tin metal (S:Sn 80:20 w/w)

 </sup> The results of the study may actually shed light on possible applications of the highly concentrated glyme-based electrolytes for achieving new rechargeable batteries with remarkable safety content using the highly energetic, yet challenging, lithium–metal anode.
