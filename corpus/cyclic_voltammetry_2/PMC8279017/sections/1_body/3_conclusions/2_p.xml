<p>In summary, the findings of this work suggested the possible use of concentrated solutions based on end-capped glymes in efficient lithium–metal cells by careful tuning of (i) the ether chain length, (ii) the salt nature and concentration, (iii) the chemistry of the cathode material, and (iv) the operative conditions, including temperature and voltage limits. In addition, the intrinsically lower flammability of the concentrated glymes reported herein compared to the common electrolytes used in cell is expected to allow the development of a lithium–metal battery with high energy and acceptable safety content.</p>
