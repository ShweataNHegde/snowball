<p>The electrochemical tests were carried out in CR2032 coin-type cells assembled in an Ar-filled glovebox (MBraun, O
 <sub>2</sub> and H
 <sub>2</sub>O content below 1 ppm) by employing a 14 mm diameter lithium disk as the anode. The S:Sn 80:20 and LFP electrodes were obtained by NMP-solvent casting of the active materials (80% wt), Super P carbon (10% wt, Timcal) and polyvinilidene fluoride (10% wt, Solef
 <sup>Ⓡ</sup> 6020 PVDF) on a porous carbon-cloth foil (GDL, ELAT 1400, MTI Corp.) or an aluminum current collector, respectively. The active material loading was of about 1.3 mg cm
 <sup>−2</sup> for S:Sn 80:20 and 4.5 mg cm
 <sup>−2</sup> for LFP as normalized to the electrode geometric area (1.54 cm
 <sup>2</sup>). The cathodes were separated from the lithium anode by a 16 mm Celgard (2400) foil soaked with the electrolyte solution (either DEGDME_HCE or TREGDME_HCE, see below for the related amounts) in the Li/S:Sn 80:20 cells, while they were separated by two GF/A glass fiber Whatman 16 mm disks soaked with the electrolyte solution (either DEGDME_HCE or TREGDME_HCE) in the Li/LFP cells.
