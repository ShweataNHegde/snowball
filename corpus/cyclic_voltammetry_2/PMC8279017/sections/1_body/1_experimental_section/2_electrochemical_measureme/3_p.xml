<p>The Li/S:Sn 80:20 cells were tested through galvanostatic cycling measurements carried out at the constant current rate of C/5 at 25 and 35 °C and of 1C at 35 °C (1C = 1675 mA g
 <sub>S</sub>
 <sup>–1</sup>). The cells cycled at the current of C/5 employed 60 μL of electrolyte solution and a voltage range of 1.9–2.8 V, while voltage limits of 1.6 and 2.8 V and an electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 20 μL mg
 <sup>–1</sup> were adopted for the cells tested at 1C. The galvanostatic cycling measurements of the Li/LFP cells were performed at the constant current rate of C/5 (1C = 170 mA g
 <sup>–1</sup>) at room temperature (25 °C), in a 2.7–3.9 V voltage range. Additional tests were carried out at C/5 and C/3 by exploiting a voltage range between 1.2 and 3.9 V during the first charge–discharge cycle and between 2.7 and 3.9 V for the subsequent ones. All of the galvanostatic cycling measurements were performed by using a MACCOR series 4000 battery test system.
