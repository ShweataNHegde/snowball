 <sup>+/0</sup> intermediates which are generated at more positive potentials. The number of TFEOH equivalents in the adducts shows a dependence on the concentration of BQ: 5.6 at 0.5 mM of BQ to 4.7 at 2.5 mM of BQ. Given that the solvation shell of these anion adducts in MeCN solution with elevated TFEOH concentrations is by all definitions a non-ideal solvent, it is important to note that the continuum of proton placement is not trivial to articulate. Should formal proton transfer from TFEOH occur, the anionic bases generated in solution are likely to remain strongly associated to any protonated quinone product. Based on NMR data obtained from coulometric experiments, we consider that these data suggest the average structure in solution is best described as [H
