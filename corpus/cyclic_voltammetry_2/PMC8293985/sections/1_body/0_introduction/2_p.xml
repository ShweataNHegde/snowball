<p>It has been previously demonstrated that 
 <italic>p</italic>-hydroquinone (H
 <sub>2</sub>Q) can function as an electron–proton transfer mediator (EPTM) in the co-electrocatalytic reduction of O
 <sub>2</sub> to H
 <sub>2</sub>O by a Co(salophen) compound.

 </sup> In the co-electrocatalytic system, formal reduction and protonation of BQ to generate H
 <sub>2</sub>Q is proposed to occur in 
 <italic>N</italic>,
 <italic>N</italic>-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution with acetic acid (AcOH; p
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>a</sub>(DMF) = 13 (ref. 
 <xref rid="cit9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)) as a proton donor. In this system, H
 <sub>2</sub>Q is a discrete intermediate, which engages in the formal transfer of proton and electron equivalents to intermediate Co–O
 <sub>2</sub>[H]
 <sup>+/0</sup> species. Importantly, the presence of the EPTM shifted product selectivity from H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (91% efficiency under otherwise identical conditions with Co(salophen) and decamethylferrocene as the electron source) to H
 <sub>2</sub>O (overall quantitative, thanks to thermal reactivity between H
 <sub>2</sub>Q, Co(salophen), and O
 <sub>2</sub>).
