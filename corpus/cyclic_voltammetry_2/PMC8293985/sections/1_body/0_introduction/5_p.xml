<p>We were interested in the possibility that the stabilizing effect of hydrogen-bonds on BQ anions could enable them to perform a similar function to H
 <sub>2</sub>Q for co-electrocatalytic O
 <sub>2</sub> reduction. One advantage would be that these intermediates would be comprised of highly reversible interactions, minimizing the height of any new kinetic barriers in the co-electrocatalytic mechanism. In MeCN, the p

 <sub>a</sub>(1) and p

 <sub>a</sub>(2) of H
 <sub>2</sub>Q have been estimated computationally to be 26.20 and 40.96, respectively.

 </sup> This means that there is a range of approximately 14 p

 <sub>a</sub> units where speciation should favor only partial protonation of [BQ]

 </sup> To the best of our knowledge, the use of hydrogen-bonded quinone anion adducts in an analogous role to their hydroquinone counterparts has only been applied to the study of quinone-based energy storage systems.
