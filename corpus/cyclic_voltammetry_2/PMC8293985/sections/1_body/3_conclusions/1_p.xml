<p>These results suggest that energy transduction reactions analogous to those mediated by EPTMs are kinetically feasible by leveraging potential inversion phenomena from non-covalent effects, greatly expanding hypothetical reaction conditions. This suggests that an expanded range of weak proton donors can be used to achieve co-electrocatalytic changes in product distribution, enabling alternative strategies to optimize kinetic parameters of a co-electrocatalytic reaction without causing the large increases in the overpotential of the reaction that result from using strong acids.</p>
