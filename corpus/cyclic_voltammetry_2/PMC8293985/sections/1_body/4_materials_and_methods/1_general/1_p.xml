 </sup> For all air-sensitive reactions and electrochemical experiments, HPLC-grade solvents were obtained as anhydrous and air-free from a PPT Glass Contour Solvent Purification System. Gas cylinders were obtained from Praxair (Ar as 5.0; O
 <sub>2</sub> as 4.0) and passed through the electrochemical working solvent with added molecular sieves prior to use. Gas mixing for variable concentration experiments was accomplished using a gas proportioning rotameter from Omega Engineering. UV-vis absorbance spectra were obtained on a Cary 60 from Agilent. An Anton-Parr Multiwave Pro SOLV, NXF-8 microwave reactor was used for microwave syntheses.
