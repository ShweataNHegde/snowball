<p>Rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) experiments were conducted using a Metrohm rotator with a Metrohm electrode consisting of a glassy carbon disk (
 <italic>ϕ</italic> = 5 mm) and a Pt ring. The average collection efficiency of the RRDE electrode was experimentally determined to be 25.5% using 0.5 mM ferrocene in 0.1 M TBAPF
 <sub>6</sub>/MeCN. The counter electrode in the RRDE experiments was a glassy carbon rod (Type 2, 
 <italic>ϕ</italic> = 3 mm; Alfa Aesar) and the reference electrode was a non-aqueous Ag/AgCl reference electrode with a double-junction system from Metrohm. RRDE experiments were performed in a 50 mL graduated glass vessel from Metrohm as a single-chamber cell with adapted ports for all electrodes. All RRDE data was referenced to an internal ferrocene standard.
