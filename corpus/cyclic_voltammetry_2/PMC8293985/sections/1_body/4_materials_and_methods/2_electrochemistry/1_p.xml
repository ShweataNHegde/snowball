<p>All electroanalytical experiments were performed using a Metrohm Autolab PGSTAT302N potentiostat. Glassy carbon working (
 <italic>ϕ</italic> = 3 mm) and non-aqueous silver/silver chloride pseudoreference electrodes behind PTFE tips were obtained from CH Instruments. The pseudoreference electrodes were obtained by depositing chloride on bare silver wire in 10% HCl at oxidizing potentials and stored in a 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF
 <sub>6</sub>) acetonitrile solution in the dark prior to use. The counter electrode was a glassy carbon rod (
 <italic>ϕ</italic> = 3 mm). All CV experiments were performed in a modified scintillation vial (20 mL volume) as a single-chamber cell with a cap modified with ports for all electrodes and a sparging needle. Tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate was purified by recrystallization from ethanol and dried in a vacuum oven before being stored in a desiccator. All data were referenced to an internal ferrocene standard (ferrocenium/ferrocene Fc
 <sup>+</sup>/Fc reduction potential under stated conditions) unless otherwise specified; ferrocene was purified by sublimation prior to use. All voltammograms were corrected for internal resistance.
