<p>Notably, with 
 <bold>1</bold>, 0.5 mM BQ, and 1.37 M TFEOH under Ar saturation conditions, a shift in the BQ reduction potential is observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C</xref>, comparing red and black). Specifically, the BQ redox feature (0.5 mM) in the presence of 1.37 M TFEOH shifts to more positive potentials by 0.046 V when 
 <bold>1</bold> (0.5 mM) is added. Based on this, we qualitatively interpret the positive shifts in the BQ reduction potential to be the result of an interaction between the hydrogen-bonded [H
 <sub>2</sub>Q(AH)
 <sub>3</sub>(A)
 <sub>2</sub>]
 <sup>2−</sup> and the one-electron reduced and monoprotonated product of 
 <bold>1</bold>. However, due to the closeness of the of BQ and Mn reduction potentials (

 <sub>p</sub> = −0.60 V and −0.77 V 
 <italic>vs.</italic> Fc
 <sup>+</sup>/Fc with 0.2 M TFEOH, respectively) and their respective dependences on added TFEOH concentration, more rigorous quantification is not possible. We note that our previous studies have shown that the ligand framework of 
 <bold>1</bold> is sensitive to protonation upon Mn(
 <sc>iii</sc>)/(
 <sc>ii</sc>) reduction in the presence of an acid.

 </sup> No shift is observed for the Mn(
 <sc>iii</sc>)/(
 <sc>ii</sc>) reduction because the reduced BQ species are not generated until more negative potentials.
