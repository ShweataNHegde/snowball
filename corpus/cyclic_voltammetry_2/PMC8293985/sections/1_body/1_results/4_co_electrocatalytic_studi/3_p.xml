<p>We have established in our previous studies that the Mn catalyst binds O
 <sub>2</sub> to generate a Mn(
 <sc>iii</sc>)-superoxide, which is reduced to a hydroperoxide with proton transfer at more negative potentials.

 </sup> Since the potential for the reduction of this Mn(
 <sc>iii</sc>)-superoxide intermediate overlaps with the reduction of BQ under these conditions, we propose that the observed co-electrocatalysis arises from an intermolecular reaction as summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn7">eqn (7)</xref>.
