<p>Based on these observations, we next conducted CV experiments using BQ, H
 <sub>2</sub>Q, AcOH and TFEOH to establish whether evidence of 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">eqn (3)</xref> was apparent. If 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">eqn (3)</xref> was relevant on the electrochemical timescale under these conditions, there should be a quantifiable difference in the reduction of BQ, with and without a stoichiometric amount of H
 <sub>2</sub>Q present, consistent with a favorable equilibrium interaction (
 <italic>K</italic> &gt; 1). With and without 1.37 M TFEOH present, we observed no evidence of an analogous strong interaction during the reduction of BQ when H
 <sub>2</sub>Q was present (Fig. S15 and S16
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">†</xref>), suggesting minimal speciation of the dianionic quinhydrone species [H

 <sup>2−</sup> with an excess of proton donor present. Others have noted previously that much greater concentrations than those used here are required to observe this interaction, which resulted in diagnostic electrode adsorption features in the observed CV response.

 </sup> The reduction features of BQ with 1.37 M TFEOH present are approximately 0.36 V more negative than those with 1.37 M AcOH present, a trend which holds from 0.5 mM to 2.5 mM BQ (Fig. S17 and S18
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">†</xref>). These observations are consistent with the expected difference in proton donor activity and do not exclude the formation of monoprotonated [HQ]
 <sup>−</sup>, particularly given the predicted p

 <sub>a</sub> values. However, these experimental conditions represent a non-ideal solvent system not reflected in the theoretical approach and therefore the only direct structural evidence shows H
 <sub>2</sub>Q generation.
