<p>Rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) experiments were carried out to quantify the electrocatalytic production of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (see Materials and methods for description). Control experiments with BQ and added TFEOH showed that the electrogenerated [H
 <sub>2</sub>Q(AH)
 <sub>3</sub>(A)
 <sub>2</sub>]
 <sup>2−</sup> decomposes to produce a small amount of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (10(±23)% (Fig. S35–S40 and Table S3
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">†</xref>)). In CVs of BQ with TFEOH present under O
 <sub>2</sub> saturation there is no multielectron catalytic response at reducing potentials (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). We postulate that this discounts appreciable H
 <sub>2</sub>O generation during the catalytic response, which would otherwise explain the less-than-quantitative ring current corresponding to H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> oxidation. The proposed instability is consistent with the observations of others.
