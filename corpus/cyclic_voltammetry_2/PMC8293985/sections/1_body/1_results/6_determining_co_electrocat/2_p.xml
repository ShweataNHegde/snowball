<p>With 
 <bold>1</bold> and 1.37 M TFEOH under O
 <sub>2</sub> saturation conditions, the system exhibited comparable selectivity for H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> compared to our previous report, 68(±13)% (Fig. S41 and Table S3
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">†</xref>). Here, the use of greater concentrations of TFEOH than previously reported

 </sup> resulted in a slight shift of the average product distribution, but was within error of the original report. Upon the addition of one equivalent of BQ relative to 
 <bold>1</bold> under these conditions, the system showed selectivity for H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> within error of the BQ-free system (69(±0.3)%). An increased cathodic current response was observed, suggesting reaction rate enhancement under 1 : 1 co-electrocatalytic conditions (Fig. S42–S47
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">†</xref>). At 2.5 equivalents of BQ (1.25 mM) relative to 
 <bold>1</bold> (0.5 mM), the selectivity of the system shifted to H
 <sub>2</sub>O as the major product with 55(±4)% efficiency (Fig. S48–S53 and Table S3
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">†</xref>). Lastly, with five equivalents of BQ (2.5 mM) relative to 
 <bold>1</bold> (0.5 mM), the selectivity of the system became 96(±0.5)% selective for H
 <sub>2</sub>O (Fig. S54–S59 and Table S3
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">†</xref>). Consistent with the role of added BQ in shifting product selectivity, the observed decreases in efficiency for H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> showed a linear relationship with respect to the concentration of added BQ (
