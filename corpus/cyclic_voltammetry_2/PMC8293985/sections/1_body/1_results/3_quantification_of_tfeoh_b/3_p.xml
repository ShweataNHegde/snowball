<p>The experimental observation of irreversibility at higher TFEOH concentrations, which cannot be analyzed by the method above (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>), coupled with the multiple equivalents solvating the anionic species suggest that additional formal proton transfer can occur.

 </sup> It is worth noting that the non-ideality of the solvent system should support additional proton transfer reactions, where high concentrations of TFEOH are expected to favorably solvate mono- and dianionic species.

 </sup> As discussed above, previous computational studies estimate that TFEOH has sufficient proton activity to monoprotonate [BQ]
