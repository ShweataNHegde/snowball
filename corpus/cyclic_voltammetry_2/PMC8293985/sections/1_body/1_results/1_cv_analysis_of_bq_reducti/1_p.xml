<p>Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were carried out with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF
 <sub>6</sub>) as supporting electrolyte in acetonitrile (MeCN) solution. Under argon (Ar) saturation conditions, BQ displays two reversible redox features with

 </sup> These reduction features are assigned to BQ/[BQ]˙
