<p>Titrating increasing quantities of TFEOH into an Ar-saturated MeCN solution of 0.5 mM BQ resulted in the convergence of these two redox processes into a single irreversible redox feature at 1.37 M TFEOH (voltage at half-peak current −0.66 V 
 <italic>vs.</italic> Fc
 <sup>+</sup>/Fc), which displayed an increased current response relative to the one-electron redox features under aprotic conditions (Table S1
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">†</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>, blue and black traces). The titration data at low [TFEOH] were consistent with the response observed for analogous experiments with 2.5 mM BQ, however the same degree of irreversibility was not observed at the higher BQ concentration (Fig. S4 and Table S2
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">†</xref>). Comparing CV titration data with BQ and TFEOH under Ar and O
 <sub>2</sub> did not reveal significant differences in the observed electrochemical response, indicating that the anionic species generated under these conditions does not interact with O
 <sub>2</sub> in a catalytic fashion on the CV timescale (Fig. S5
