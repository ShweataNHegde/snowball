 </sup> These solvent clusters assist thermodynamically favored monoprotonation of the intermediate [BQ]
 <sup>−</sup> species as a part of a proton-coupled electron transfer reaction to generate a stabilized [HQ]
 <sup>−</sup> species. The concerted nature of this proton and electron transfer results in a standard potential which is more positive than the initial reduction, which is observed experimentally as an overall two-electron reduction feature.
