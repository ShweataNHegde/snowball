<p>Based on our results, we propose that the hydrogen bond-stabilized [H
 <sub>2</sub>Q(AH)
 <sub>3</sub>(A)
 <sub>2</sub>]
 <sup>2−</sup> adduct serves as a redox mediator in these co-electrocatalytic reactions, delivering electrons and a single proton to Mn–O

 </sup> In doing so, BQ also facilitates the net transfer of TFEOH to a Mn catalyst during the reaction. As [H
 <sub>2</sub>Q(AH)
 <sub>3</sub>(A)
 <sub>2</sub>]
 <sup>2−</sup> is oxidized to BQ, several equivalents of TFEOH are released from strong hydrogen-bonding interactions, allowing formal proton and electron transfer to the Mn catalyst to occur. In the previously reported use of a BQ/H
 <sub>2</sub>Q couple to achieve a co-electrocatalytic effect, separate hydrogen atom transfer and proton-coupled electron transfer steps from H
 <sub>2</sub>Q were proposed to occur.
