<p>Due to the continuous need for high-performance batteries, research interests in energy storage materials have become more significant as we move towards sustainable energy applications. Li-ion technology has remained at the forefront of energy research due to lithium’s high, variable discharge rate and specific capacity, as well as its small size [

 <xref rid="B2-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] as a method of improving the safety aspects of Li-based batteries through the use of intercalated electrodes. Today, the most commonly used Li-ion battery (LIB) involve intercalation materials, typically consisting of a cathode in the form of Li

 <xref rid="B5-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] as the anode. Layered lithium metal oxides provide ≈170 mAh/g, whilst graphite has a low theoretical specific capacity of 372 mAh/g. This combination provides a specific energy of ≈150 Wh/kg [
 <xref rid="B6-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], making it suitable enough for the small-scale applications it is found in today. However, large-scale applications, such as energy storage systems and electric vehicles, demand batteries with a much higher capacity and longer cycling capabilities [
