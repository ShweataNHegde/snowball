<p>Film thickness of the Si-based anode materials (Si and Si
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub>) was measured by topography. The thickness of the Si film after a 1-h deposition time was estimated to be 124.9 nm, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f007">Figure 7</xref>a. Si was deposited on Cu using RF sputtering for 6 h, which gave an overall thickness of 749.4 nm. The approximate thickness of the Si
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub> film after a 1-h deposition was 54.8 nm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f007">Figure 7</xref>b). Based on these values, the estimated thickness of the bilayer film (Si
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub>@Si) was 804.2 nm.
