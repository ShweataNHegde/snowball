<p>SEM was carried out to produce images of the surface of each of the thin films prepared in the present work. Micrographs can help identify any differences between the films, as well as the effects of cycling on the Si
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu anode material. Scanning electron micrographs are given in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f004">Figure 4</xref>a, an amorphous silicon structure formed on the surface of Cu foil due to the RF magnetron sputtering process, which was previously confirmed using XRD and Raman spectroscopy. Compared to the Si@Cu film, the surface of deposited Si

 <sub>4</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f004">Figure 4</xref>b,c) appeared to be rougher with more spherical particles. The additional roughness on the surface and protective layer provided by Si

 <sub>4</sub> may help in aiding with the volume expansion and contraction of the Si surface during battery cycling.
