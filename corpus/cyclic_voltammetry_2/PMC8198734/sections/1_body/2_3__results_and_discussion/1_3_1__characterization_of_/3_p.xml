<p>The pristine Si
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu anode was subjected to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis to determine the original composition of the anodeâ€™s surface prior to cycling. The XPS spectra of Si 2p, N 1s, Li 1s, F 1s, O 1s, and C 1s are given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f003">Figure 3</xref>. The presence of oxygen could be due to the formation of oxides (CuO and SiO
 <sub>2</sub>) when the sample was exposed to air before and after the sputtering experiments. In the pristine anode, three peaks were observed in the Si 2p spectra (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f003">Figure 3</xref>a), which matched well with the binding energies of SiN
 <sub>0.73</sub> (100.5 eV), Si
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub> (101.7 eV), and SiO
 <sub>2</sub> (103.2 eV) reported in the literature [
 <xref rid="B28-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. These were further confirmed with the N1s and O1s spectra in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f003">Figure 3</xref>b,e, respectively. As expected, no peaks are observed in the Li 1s (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f003">Figure 3</xref>c) and F 1s spectra (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f003">Figure 3</xref>d) for the pristine Si
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu anode, as no interaction occurred between the electrodes and electrolytes. Two peaks that are attributed to CuO and SiO
 <sub>2</sub> were observed in the O 1s spectra, which occur naturally when exposed to the oxygen in air. The presence of four peaks in the C 1s spectra can be ascribed to the presence of residual acetone, which is used to clean the XPS chamber and the sample holder.
