<p>Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy was performed with SEM to identify the elemental composition of each prepared film. The results from the EDX analysis are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f005">Figure 5</xref>. The analysis of the Si@Cu film confirmed the presence of Si and Cu, whilst the presence of N was also detected in the Si
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub>@Cu film (the cps for nitrogen is 0.392 keV). As for the Si
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu film, the presence of Si and N was confirmed. Based on these results, thin film deposition via RF magnetron sputtering generated the desired materials.
