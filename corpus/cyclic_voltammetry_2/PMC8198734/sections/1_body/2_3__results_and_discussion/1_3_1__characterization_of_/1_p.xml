<p>Thin films were prepared (Si@Cu, Si
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub>@Cu, and Si
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu) using RF sputtering technique for various hours in a controlled environment (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot2-materials-14-02824">Section 2.2</xref>). The as-prepared films were characterized using a range of analytical techniques: XRD, Raman spectroscopy, XPS, SEM, EDX, and TEM. The thicknesses of the films were evaluated after the sputtering process at specific times. The electrochemical performance of Si
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu as the anode material in half cells was assessed against Li
 <sup>+</sup>/Li using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD). The performance of the Si-based anode material was evaluated in a full cell with LFP. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted to confirm the deposition of Si and Si
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub> layers on the Cu sheet, as well as the detection of any compounds that might be present prior to cycling. The results from the XRD analysis are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f001">Figure 1</xref>. From the spectra of the reference materials (Si
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub>, Si, SiO
 <sub>2</sub>, and Cu), two peaks corresponding to Si
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub> were confirmed at 2θ = 71 and 90°. The majority of the peaks with the highest intensity coincided with the XRD spectrum of Cu. There were no peaks corresponding to Si and SiO
 <sub>2</sub>, indicating that the amorphous Si structure was deposited directly on the Cu substrate. This confirms the successful deposition of crystalline Si
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub> on a Si@Cu layer via RF magnetron sputtering.
