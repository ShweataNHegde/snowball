<p>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted to provide further information on the morphology of the as-prepared Si-based films beyond the surface. The first micrograph (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f006">Figure 6</xref>a) presents a network of amorphous silicon film, as opposed to the smooth structure in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f006">Figure 6</xref>b and the disconnected structure in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f006">Figure 6</xref>c. Evidently, the Si
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu film has numerous spherical particles that are not present in the other Si-based films, as can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f006">Figure 6</xref>c. This micrograph shows a homogeneous layer of amorphous silicon with a silicon nitride layer.
