<p>Raman spectroscopy was carried out for the three Si-based thin films prepared using RF sputtering. The Raman spectra of the Si-based anode materials shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f002">Figure 2</xref> give a clear distinction between Si
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub>@Cu film and the other thin films, showing its much greater intensity. The spectra of Si@Cu and Si
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu films are identical, with only a slight difference in intensity. The Raman spectrum for Si@Cu film (red) shows a peak at approximately 470 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, as indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f002">Figure 2</xref>, which occurs due to the Si–Si bond. According to studies on amorphous silicon [

 <xref rid="B32-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], the characterizing peak of amorphous Si is a broad band centered at 480 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, also known as the transverse optical (TO) peak. In addition, the absence of a sharp peak at 520 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, typical of crystalline Si, confirms the formation of amorphous Si film in all as-prepared materials. The two smaller peaks, centered at approximately 150 and 320 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, correspond to the transverse acoustical (TA) and longitudinal acoustical (LA) peaks of Si–Si bonds, respectively [
