<p>Following the half cell tests, the electrochemical performance of the Si
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu anode was evaluated in a full cell combined with an LFP cathode at 200 mA/g, as presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f012">Figure 12</xref>. The GCD cycling of the full cell shows that the discharge and charge capacities were equal, initially below 900 mAh/g and then gradually decreased to 600 mAh/g. The coulombic efficiency of the cell was above 50% in the first cycle, which increased to 100% by the second cycle and remained constant throughout the 20 cycles. The battery delivered a satisfactory specific capacity and excellent efficiency; thus, a very good performance was observed from the anode material, which can be improved further in future studies.
