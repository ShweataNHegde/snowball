<p>Galvanostatic chargeâ€“discharge (GCD) tests were performed to investigate the cycling behavior of Si
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu as an anode material for LIBs when fully discharged and charged. The tests were carried out at various current densities to examine their effects on stability. The GCD plot carried out at 100 mA/g showed the highest stability and achieved the highest specific capacities in 10 cycles (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f010">Figure 10</xref>b). As the current density was increased to 1000 mA/g, the stability decreased throughout 500 cycles (

 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu as an anode in a half cell performed significantly better at lower current densities.
