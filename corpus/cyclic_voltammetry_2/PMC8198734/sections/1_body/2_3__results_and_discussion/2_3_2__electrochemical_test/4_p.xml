<p>Using the results from the GCD, the cycling stability of the Si
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu anode was evaluated during 50 cycles at 20 and 1000 mA/g. The plots are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f011">Figure 11</xref>. At a current density of 20 mA/g (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f011">Figure 11</xref>a), the discharge and charge capacities in the first cycle are 3000 and 2500 mAh/g, respectively. This led to an initial coulombic efficiency of 82%. After 15–20 cycles, the plots for specific charge and discharge capacities started to overlap, which is evident in the improved coulombic efficiency (99%). The specific capacity gradually decreased throughout the test until reaching 2000 mAh/g by the end of the 50th cycle. At a higher current density of 1000 mA/g (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f011">Figure 11</xref>b), lower discharge and charge capacities were attained in the first cycle (≈800 and 600 mAh/g, respectively). In the first 15 cycles, the specific capacity increased, followed by a slight decrease. This wave pattern was repeated twice then continued into a gradual decline in the last 10 cycles. However, the capacity values remained between 800 and 1000 mAh/g, suggesting a greater stability during cycling than at a lower current density. The coulombic efficiency achieved was initially 74%, which increased to 99% after about 15 cycles and then remained constant throughout cycling.
