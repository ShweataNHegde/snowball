<p>Using SEM, the changes in the surface of the Si
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu anode after lithiation and subsequent delithiation (first discharge to 0.05 V, first charge to 1.2 V) were examined and presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f013">Figure 13</xref>. Before the charge-discharge cycle, the micrograph of the as-prepared anode material displays a homogeneous layer of Si
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub>. Upon the first discharge, also known as lithiation, the presence of elevated crystalline particles on the surface of the anode was observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f013">Figure 13</xref>b). This morphological change, which may imply an expansion in volume. After completing the first chargeâ€“discharge cycle wherein lithiation and delithiation occur, the surface of the anode material appears to return back to its original state, although slightly raised. This indicates that the volume change during lithiation/delithiation did not deteriorate the anode materials (no cracks were observed).
