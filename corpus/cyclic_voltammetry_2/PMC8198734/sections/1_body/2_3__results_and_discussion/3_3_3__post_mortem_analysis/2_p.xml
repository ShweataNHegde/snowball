<p>XRD analysis was conducted after the charge and discharge processes to confirm whether the lithiation reaction has occurred and to identify the compounds that form after lithiation and delithiation. The results from the XRD analysis are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f014">Figure 14</xref>. After lithiation (discharge), four compounds have been detected: Si
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub>, Li
 <sub>3</sub>N, Li
 <sub>2</sub>O, and LiSi. The detection of Si
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub> confirms that this deposited layer remained on top of the Si layer to act as a protective barrier. The formation of LiSi, Li
 <sub>3</sub>N, and Li
 <sub>2</sub>O confirm the lithiation reaction, wherein Li
 <sup>+</sup> ions react with Si, N, and O. This indicates the destruction of the anode following the reaction. After delithiation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f014">Figure 14</xref>b), it is evident that LiSi is no longer present, which indicates a reversible reaction between Li and Si. Therefore, this confirms that the Si in the as-prepared anode is capable of undergoing a successful delithiation reaction during the charging process. However, the presence of Li
 <sub>3</sub>N and Li
 <sub>2</sub>O have been detected after delithiation, which may indicate that these compounds remained on the surface and became part of the SEI.
