<p>Thin film deposition was carried out using a radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering system (PTL5S PVD, Plasma Technology Limited—PTL, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong). Pure Si target was deposited on a copper (Cu) foil substrate (current collector) in a vacuum chamber for 6 h in the preparation of Si@Cu film. The same procedure was conducted for 1 h to achieve Si
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub>@Cu film, with Si
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub> as the target. The combined Si
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu film was involved the deposition of Si on Cu foil for 6 h, followed by Si
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub> on Si for 1 h. Each of the films were RF-sputtered with an RF power of 150 W. In order to achieve a uniform film deposition, substrates were rotated continuously with a stepper motor throughout the sputtering step. The process of sputtering was conducted at 5 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup> Pa with a plasma pressure of 0.4 Pa in pure argon (working gas) at a flow rate of 10 sccm at 27 °C.
