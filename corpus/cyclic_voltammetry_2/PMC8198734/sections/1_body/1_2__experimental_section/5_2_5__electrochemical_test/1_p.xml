<p>Cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were conducted using a CorrTest CS350 Potentiostat/Galvanostat Electrochemical Workstation (Wuhan Corrtest Instruments Corp., Ltd., Wuhan, China) at a scan rate of 0.01 mV/s. Galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) was carried out using an MTI 8 Channels Battery Analyzer BST8-WA (0.005â€“1 mA, up to 5 V, Richmond, CA, USA) at different current densities (20 and 1000 mA/g). The electrochemical performance of Si
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu was evaluated in a full cell with lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>; LFP).
