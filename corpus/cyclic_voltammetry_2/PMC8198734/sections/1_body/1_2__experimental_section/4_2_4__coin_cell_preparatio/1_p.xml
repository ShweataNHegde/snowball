<p>The as-prepared films were cut into 16-mm disks using a precision disk cutter (MTI, MSK-T10, Richmond, CA, USA)Inside a glovebox (MTI, VGB-6-LD, Richmond, CA, USA), CR-2032 coin cells (MTI, VGB-6-LD, Richmond, CA, SUA) were assembled in a controlled atmosphere using an H
 <sub>2</sub>O and O
 <sub>2</sub> purification system (&lt;1 ppm of water and oxygen). The anode active material loading (in half cell and full cell) was 0.3 mg/cm
 <sup>2</sup> Lithium metal disks were used as both counter and reference electrodes in half-cell configurations. In the full cell, LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub> (LFP) was used as the cathode material. The LFP cathode was fabricated by mixing LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub> powder with super P conductive carbon black (MTI, EQ-Lib-SuperP, Richmond, CA, USA), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) in 
 <italic>N</italic>-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) using a ball miller homogenizer for 1 h at 380 rpm. After ball milling, the obtained slurry was uniformly spread onto an aluminum foil (as the current collector) using a doctor blade (MTI, MSK-AFA-I, Richmond, CA, USA) to obtain a coating thickness of 5 µm. The composition of the slurry was 18/72/10 for C/LFP/PVDF, respectively. The cathode active material was directly cut into disks with a mass loading of 5 mg/cm
 <sup>2</sup>. A polypropylene membrane (Celgard, 2400, Asahi Kasei Corp., Tokyo, Japan) was used as the separator. A total of 20 μL of the electrolyte 1 M LiPF
 <sub>6</sub> dissolved in EC/DMC/DEC (1:1:1 
 <italic>v/v/v</italic>) mixture was added.
