<p>X-ray diffractometry (XRD) (PAnalytical Empyrean X-ray diffractometer, 40 KV/30 mA, Malvern Panalytical Ltd., Cambridge, UK) was conducted at a scan rate of 2°/min between 20° and 90° to identify the crystal structures of each sample. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out using an FEI Nova NanoSEM 450 (FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR, USA) to provide images of the deposited thin films, before and after cycling. Using the same instrument, energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy was completed to determine the composition of the elements in each sample. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted using a FEI Tecnai G2 TEM TF20 (FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR, USA) to evaluate the films’ internal structures. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was done using an AXIS Ultra DLD (Kratos Analytical Ltd., Manchester, UK) to identify the chemical distribution of elements on the films’ surfaces. Raman spectroscopy (Thermo Scientific™ DXR™ 2 Raman Microscope, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Darmstadt, Germany) was used to provide more information on the morphology of the as-prepared films. The thickness of the films was estimated using a Leica DCM8 Profilometer (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany).</p>
