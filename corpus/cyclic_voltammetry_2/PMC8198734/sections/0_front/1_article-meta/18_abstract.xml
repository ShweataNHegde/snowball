 <p>Silicon and silicon nitride (Si
  <sub>3</sub>N
  <sub>4</sub>) are some of the most appealing candidates as anode materials for LIBs (Li-ion battery) due to their favorable characteristics: low cost, abundance of Si, and high theoretical capacity. However, these materials have their own set of challenges that need to be addressed for practical applications. A thin film consisting of silicon nitride-coated silicon on a copper current collector (Si
  <sub>3</sub>N
  <sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu) has been prepared in this work via RF magnetron sputtering (Radio Frequency magnetron sputtering). The anode material was characterized before and after cycling to assess the difference in appearance and composition using XRD (X-ray Powder Diffraction), XPS (X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy), SEM/EDX (Scanning Electron Microscopy/ Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis), and TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy). The effect of the silicon nitride coating on the electrochemical performance of the anode material for LIBs was evaluated against Si@Cu film. It has been found that the Si
  <sub>3</sub>N
  <sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu anode achieved a higher capacity retention (90%) compared to Si@Cu (20%) after 50 cycles in a half-cell versus Li
  <sup>+</sup>/Li, indicating a significant improvement in electrochemical performance. In a full cell, the Si
  <sub>3</sub>N
  <sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu anode achieved excellent efficiency and acceptable specific capacities, which can be enhanced with further research.
