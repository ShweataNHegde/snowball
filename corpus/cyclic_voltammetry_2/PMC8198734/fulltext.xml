However, these materials have their own set of challenges that need to be addressed for practical applications. A thin film consisting of silicon nitride-coated silicon on a copper current collector (Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu) has been prepared in this work via RF magnetron sputtering (Radio Frequency magnetron sputtering). The anode material was characterized before and after cycling to assess the difference in appearance and composition using XRD (X-ray Powder Diffraction), XPS (X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy), SEM/EDX (Scanning Electron Microscopy/ Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis), and TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy). The effect of the silicon nitride coating on the electrochemical performance of the anode material for LIBs was evaluated against Si@Cu film. It has been found that the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu anode achieved a higher capacity retention (90%) compared to Si@Cu (20%) after 50 cycles in a half-cell versus Li<sup>+</sup>/Li, indicating a significant improvement in electrochemical performance. In a full cell, the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu anode achieved excellent efficiency and acceptable specific capacities, which can be enhanced with further research.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Li-ion batteries</kwd><kwd>silicon-based anode</kwd><kwd>thin film</kwd><kwd>RF sputtering</kwd><kwd>performance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-materials-14-02824"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Due to the continuous need for high-performance batteries, research interests in energy storage materials have become more significant as we move towards sustainable energy applications. Li-ion technology has remained at the forefront of energy research due to lithium&#x02019;s high, variable discharge rate and specific capacity, as well as its small size [<xref rid="B1-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and relatively long cycle life, among others. The concept of Li-ion technology was originally proposed by Armand [<xref rid="B2-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] as a method of improving the safety aspects of Li-based batteries through the use of intercalated electrodes. Today, the most commonly used Li-ion battery (LIB) involve intercalation materials, typically consisting of a cathode in the form of Li<sub>x</sub>M<sub>y</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (M = Co, Ni, or Mn) [<xref rid="B3-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and a carbon material (i.e., graphite) [<xref rid="B5-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] as the anode. Layered lithium metal oxides provide &#x02248;170 mAh/g, whilst graphite has a low theoretical specific capacity of 372 mAh/g. This combination provides a specific energy of &#x02248;150 Wh/kg [<xref rid="B6-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], making it suitable enough for the small-scale applications it is found in today. However, large-scale applications, such as energy storage systems and electric vehicles, demand batteries with a much higher capacity and longer cycling capabilities [<xref rid="B7-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Silicon as an anode material for LIBs presents a more attractive set of attributes that make it the best alternative to graphite. Aside from being the second most abundant element in the Earth&#x02019;s crust, silicon is considered to be environment-friendly and cost-efficient [<xref rid="B8-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], as opposed to lithium. Furthermore, Si offers a high specific capacity of about 4200 mAh/g based on the formation of Li<sub>22</sub>Si<sub>4</sub> at high temperatures [<xref rid="B8-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B10-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], which is over 10 times greater than that of graphite. This is due to the ability of silicon to form Li-rich alloys (i.e., Li<sub>15</sub>Si<sub>4</sub>, Li<sub>21</sub>Si<sub>5</sub>) with lithium, as opposite to graphite where six carbon atoms bond with only one Li<sup>+</sup> ion (LiC<sub>6</sub>) [<xref rid="B6-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B12-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In addition, silicon has a moderate working potential at 0.4 V vs. Li<sup>+</sup>/Li, making it a more viable candidate as an anode for LIBs with regards to energy density and safety aspects [<xref rid="B13-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Despite these advantages, the use of silicon in commercial LIBs still proves to be unfeasible. The main obstacle to overcome with Si-based anodes is the large volume change of about 400% [<xref rid="B8-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B15-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] that occurs with lithiation/delithiation processes. The constant expansion (lithiation) and contraction (delithiation) induce stress on the Si surface, resulting in cracks and active material pulverization [<xref rid="B16-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The separation of the active material caused by the cracks results in a low electrical conductivity and prevents the transport of Li<sup>+</sup> ions [<xref rid="B17-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], which was initially provided by the addition of conductive carbon materials. Eventually, this leads to capacity fading and anode failure due to loss of electrical contact over long-term cycling [<xref rid="B8-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. At the same time, the alloying/dealloying of Li with Si leads to the formation of an unstable solid&#x02013;electrolyte interface (SEI) on the anodic surface due to volume expansion/contraction [<xref rid="B18-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In the first lithiation of a Si anode, SEI is formed and acts as a barrier between the anode and electrolyte, preventing further electrolyte decomposition. However, the SEI layer can breakdown after delithiation due to a reduced volume and reforms after repeated cycling, resulting in a thick layer and reduced anode performance [<xref rid="B7-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The use of Si-based anodes in LIBs would have a wider reach than commercial graphite-based anodes, assuming that these challenges could be overcome. Recent developments on improving the performance of Si-based anodes include Si nanostructures (nanowires, hollow nanotubes) [<xref rid="B19-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], core&#x02013;shell structures (Si as core) [<xref rid="B20-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], forming SiX alloys (X = Sn, Ge, etc.) [<xref rid="B22-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and surface coating, to name a few. In particular, coating the surface of Si with a conductive material, such as carbon [<xref rid="B24-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and copper [<xref rid="B25-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], has been employed to improve the cycling performance of Si-based anodes in LIBs. However, such modifications still failed to surpass the performance of commercial LIBs. Some researchers have investigated the potential use of silicon nitride [<xref rid="B26-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and silicon nitride-based composites [<xref rid="B28-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] as anode material for LIBs. The findings showed that these anode materials have a more stable cycling compared to silicon anodes. The downside to silicon nitride anode materials is that the specific capacities achieved are lower than theoretical values, with significant capacity fading after 100 cycles [<xref rid="B26-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Researchers have speculated that the lack of elasticity in Si anodes contribute to the rapid capacity fading in LIBs [<xref rid="B29-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Due to silicon nitride&#x02019;s mechanical proprieties, its combination with Si as an anode material through nanostructuring and thin film coating may significantly reduce the volume change that accompanies alloying/dealloying processes. In this work, we have utilized thin film technology to improve the electrical conductivity of Si by sputtering a thin layer onto copper foil, along with the addition of silicon nitride (Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) on top of the Si layer to accommodate the volume changes during lithiation/delithiation processes.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-materials-14-02824"><title>2.

The as-prepared films were characterized using a range of analytical techniques: XRD, Raman spectroscopy, XPS, SEM, EDX, and TEM. The thicknesses of the films were evaluated after the sputtering process at specific times. The electrochemical performance of Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu as the anode material in half cells was assessed against Li<sup>+</sup>/Li using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and galvanostatic charge&#x02013;discharge (GCD). The performance of the Si-based anode material was evaluated in a full cell with LFP. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted to confirm the deposition of Si and Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> layers on the Cu sheet, as well as the detection of any compounds that might be present prior to cycling. The results from the XRD analysis are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f001">Figure 1</xref>.

The majority of the peaks with the highest intensity coincided with the XRD spectrum of Cu. There were no peaks corresponding to Si and SiO<sub>2</sub>, indicating that the amorphous Si structure was deposited directly on the Cu substrate. This confirms the successful deposition of crystalline Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> on a Si@Cu layer via RF magnetron sputtering.</p><p>Raman spectroscopy was carried out for the three Si-based thin films prepared using RF sputtering. The Raman spectra of the Si-based anode materials shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f002">Figure 2</xref> give a clear distinction between Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>@Cu film and the other thin films, showing its much greater intensity. The spectra of Si@Cu and Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu films are identical, with only a slight difference in intensity. The Raman spectrum for Si@Cu film (red) shows a peak at approximately 470 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f002">Figure 2</xref>, which occurs due to the Si&#x02013;Si bond. According to studies on amorphous silicon [<xref rid="B30-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], the characterizing peak of amorphous Si is a broad band centered at 480 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, also known as the transverse optical (TO) peak. In addition, the absence of a sharp peak at 520 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, typical of crystalline Si, confirms the formation of amorphous Si film in all as-prepared materials. The two smaller peaks, centered at approximately 150 and 320 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, correspond to the transverse acoustical (TA) and longitudinal acoustical (LA) peaks of Si&#x02013;Si bonds, respectively [<xref rid="B32-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

The presence of oxygen could be due to the formation of oxides (CuO and SiO<sub>2</sub>) when the sample was exposed to air before and after the sputtering experiments. In the pristine anode, three peaks were observed in the Si 2p spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f003">Figure 3</xref>a), which matched well with the binding energies of SiN<sub>0.73</sub> (100.5 eV), Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> (101.7 eV), and SiO<sub>2</sub> (103.2 eV) reported in the literature [<xref rid="B28-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B35-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. These were further confirmed with the N1s and O1s spectra in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f003">Figure 3</xref>b,e, respectively.

Two peaks that are attributed to CuO and SiO<sub>2</sub> were observed in the O 1s spectra, which occur naturally when exposed to the oxygen in air. The presence of four peaks in the C 1s spectra can be ascribed to the presence of residual acetone, which is used to clean the XPS chamber and the sample holder.</p><p>SEM was carried out to produce images of the surface of each of the thin films prepared in the present work.

Based on these results, thin film deposition via RF magnetron sputtering generated the desired materials.</p><p>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted to provide further information on the morphology of the as-prepared Si-based films beyond the surface. The first micrograph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f006">Figure 6</xref>a) presents a network of amorphous silicon film, as opposed to the smooth structure in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f006">Figure 6</xref>b and the disconnected structure in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f006">Figure 6</xref>c. Evidently, the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu film has numerous spherical particles that are not present in the other Si-based films, as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f006">Figure 6</xref>c. This micrograph shows a homogeneous layer of amorphous silicon with a silicon nitride layer.</p><p>Film thickness of the Si-based anode materials (Si and Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) was measured by topography. The thickness of the Si film after a 1-h deposition time was estimated to be 124.9 nm, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f007">Figure 7</xref>a. Si was deposited on Cu using RF sputtering for 6 h, which gave an overall thickness of 749.4 nm. The approximate thickness of the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> film after a 1-h deposition was 54.8 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f007">Figure 7</xref>b). Based on these values, the estimated thickness of the bilayer film (Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>@Si) was 804.2 nm.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-materials-14-02824"><title>3.2. Electrochemical Tests</title><p>The electrochemical performances of the Si-based films as anode material in half cells were assessed using various electrochemical tests. These included electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and galvanostatic charge&#x02013;discharge (GCD). Cyclic voltammetry tests were conducted with Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu as an anode in a half-cell using Li metal as a counter and reference electrodes for 20 cycles between 0.05 and 1.2 V vs. Li<sup>+</sup>/Li. As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f008">Figure 8</xref>, three peaks in the cathodic (reduction) region were identified, which correspond to the discharging (lithiation) of the battery. These peaks are located at 0.28, 0.21, and 0.10 V. In the anodic (oxidation) region, two peaks were identified, which are located approximately at 0.34 and 0.50 V. This corresponds to the charging of the battery in which delithiation occurs. Apart from one cathodic peak in cycle 1, the positions of each peak are identical and overlap with each other throughout the 20 cycles. This implies that the Si-based anode has excellent recyclability. In addition, the as-prepared anode material has shown good reversibility. In comparison with a previous literature on amorphous Si (conducted at 0.01 mV/s) [<xref rid="B36-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], the voltammogram from this study is almost identical in terms of both the shapes and locations of peaks, except with one cathodic peak at 0.45 V that is only present in the CV plot of amorphous Si. On the contrary, CV curves for crystalline Si differ from the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu anode in this present work. The peaks for crystalline Si are less sharp and are shifted to lower voltages in the cathodic region [<xref rid="B37-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Therefore, these observations further support the characterization findings that the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu anode has an amorphous Si instead of crystalline Si morphology. The inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f008">Figure 8</xref> shows cycle 1 of the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu anode (blue) in comparison with Si@Cu anode (red). Both anode materials have two anodic peaks located at the same position in terms of voltage. However, three cathodic peaks were present for the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu anode, while only two peaks were observed for the Si@Cu film. Specifically, the peak located at 0.1 V is missing. Another difference is the intensity of the peaks, where the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu anode reached a higher intensity (current) than the Si@Cu anode.</p><p>The EIS Nyquist plots correlate to CV and are measured before the first CV run until after the tenth CV, as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f009">Figure 9</xref>. The size of the arcs before and after CV 1 remain the same, whilst an increase in the arc height can be seen after CV 5 and CV 10. In addition, the Nyquist plot after CV 10 has the highest increase in arc height and resistance (Z&#x02019;) due to a shift to the right. This follows the general trend in which resistance increases after numerous cycles due to conductivity.</p><p>Galvanostatic charge&#x02013;discharge (GCD) tests were performed to investigate the cycling behavior of Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu as an anode material for LIBs when fully discharged and charged. The tests were carried out at various current densities to examine their effects on stability. The GCD plot carried out at 100 mA/g showed the highest stability and achieved the highest specific capacities in 10 cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f010">Figure 10</xref>a). A similar plot is observed for a current density of 200 mA/g, but with a slightly lower stability during 20 cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f010">Figure 10</xref>b). As the current density was increased to 1000 mA/g, the stability decreased throughout 500 cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f010">Figure 10</xref>c). These observations are seen in the combined GCD plots of the first cycle at the three current densities in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f010">Figure 10</xref>d, wherein Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu as an anode in a half cell performed significantly better at lower current densities.</p><p>Using the results from the GCD, the cycling stability of the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu anode was evaluated during 50 cycles at 20 and 1000 mA/g. The plots are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f011">Figure 11</xref>. At a current density of 20 mA/g (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f011">Figure 11</xref>a), the discharge and charge capacities in the first cycle are 3000 and 2500 mAh/g, respectively. This led to an initial coulombic efficiency of 82%. After 15&#x02013;20 cycles, the plots for specific charge and discharge capacities started to overlap, which is evident in the improved coulombic efficiency (99%). The specific capacity gradually decreased throughout the test until reaching 2000 mAh/g by the end of the 50th cycle. At a higher current density of 1000 mA/g (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f011">Figure 11</xref>b), lower discharge and charge capacities were attained in the first cycle (&#x02248;800 and 600 mAh/g, respectively). In the first 15 cycles, the specific capacity increased, followed by a slight decrease. This wave pattern was repeated twice then continued into a gradual decline in the last 10 cycles. However, the capacity values remained between 800 and 1000 mAh/g, suggesting a greater stability during cycling than at a lower current density. The coulombic efficiency achieved was initially 74%, which increased to 99% after about 15 cycles and then remained constant throughout cycling.</p><p>The charge capacity during consecutive GCD tests at increasing current densities (100, 200, and 1000 mA/g) was measured, and was then returned to 100 mA/g to investigate the effect of the capacity rate on performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f011">Figure 11</xref>c). In the first 10 cycles (100 mA/g), the charge capacity remained relatively constant at approximately 1350 mAh/g. The same trend was seen for a current density of 200 mA/g, with only a slight increase in charge capacity. Upon an increase in current density to 1000 mAh/g, the specific charge capacity dropped to 600 mAh/g and continued to increase until a maximum value just above 900 mAh/g was reached. When the current density was returned back to 100 mAh/g, the capacity gradually decreased from 1350 mAh/g. These results can be explained by a more severe structural evolution at lower rates due to in-depth repetitive Li-ion insertion and extraction compared to those at high rates. Furthermore, a remarkable difference in capacity retention was observed between Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu and Si@Cu. The Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu anode material achieved about 90%, whilst Si@Cu attained a 20% capacity retention. This indicates a significant battery performance for the as-prepared Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu anode as opposed to Si@Cu film.</p><p>Following the half cell tests, the electrochemical performance of the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu anode was evaluated in a full cell combined with an LFP cathode at 200 mA/g, as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f012">Figure 12</xref>. The GCD cycling of the full cell shows that the discharge and charge capacities were equal, initially below 900 mAh/g and then gradually decreased to 600 mAh/g. The coulombic efficiency of the cell was above 50% in the first cycle, which increased to 100% by the second cycle and remained constant throughout the 20 cycles. The battery delivered a satisfactory specific capacity and excellent efficiency; thus, a very good performance was observed from the anode material, which can be improved further in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-materials-14-02824"><title>3.3. Post-Mortem Analysis</title><p>Using SEM, the changes in the surface of the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu anode after lithiation and subsequent delithiation (first discharge to 0.05 V, first charge to 1.2 V) were examined and presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f013">Figure 13</xref>. Before the charge-discharge cycle, the micrograph of the as-prepared anode material displays a homogeneous layer of Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>. Upon the first discharge, also known as lithiation, the presence of elevated crystalline particles on the surface of the anode was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f013">Figure 13</xref>b). This morphological change, which may imply an expansion in volume. After completing the first charge&#x02013;discharge cycle wherein lithiation and delithiation occur, the surface of the anode material appears to return back to its original state, although slightly raised. This indicates that the volume change during lithiation/delithiation did not deteriorate the anode materials (no cracks were observed).</p><p>XRD analysis was conducted after the charge and discharge processes to confirm whether the lithiation reaction has occurred and to identify the compounds that form after lithiation and delithiation. The results from the XRD analysis are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f014">Figure 14</xref>. After lithiation (discharge), four compounds have been detected: Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, Li<sub>3</sub>N, Li<sub>2</sub>O, and LiSi. The detection of Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> confirms that this deposited layer remained on top of the Si layer to act as a protective barrier. The formation of LiSi, Li<sub>3</sub>N, and Li<sub>2</sub>O confirm the lithiation reaction, wherein Li<sup>+</sup> ions react with Si, N, and O. This indicates the destruction of the anode following the reaction. After delithiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f014">Figure 14</xref>b), it is evident that LiSi is no longer present, which indicates a reversible reaction between Li and Si. Therefore, this confirms that the Si in the as-prepared anode is capable of undergoing a successful delithiation reaction during the charging process. However, the presence of Li<sub>3</sub>N and Li<sub>2</sub>O have been detected after delithiation, which may indicate that these compounds remained on the surface and became part of the SEI.</p><p>To gain more understanding on the composition of the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu anode post-cycling, XPS was conducted after lithiation (0.05 V) and delithiation (1.20 V) in a half-cell vs. Li<sup>+</sup>/Li. Results from the XPS analysis are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f015">Figure 15</xref>. Five peaks were resolved in the lithiated Si 2p spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f015">Figure 15</xref>a), three of which are the same compounds found in the pristine anode in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f003">Figure 3</xref>a (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot1-materials-14-02824">Section 3.1</xref>): SiN<sub>0.73</sub>, Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, and SiO<sub>2</sub> [<xref rid="B28-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B35-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In addition to these three species, LiSi and Li<sub>x</sub>SiO<sub>y</sub> were identified upon the lithiation of the anode, with peaks centered at 98.5 eV and 102.7 eV, respectively [<xref rid="B38-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. After delithiation, only Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and SiO<sub>2</sub> were found to be present on the anode&#x02019;s surface, which confirms the reversible lithiation/delithiation process. The presence of these Si-based compounds are also confirmed in the N 1s [<xref rid="B28-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B35-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and O 1s [<xref rid="B39-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] spectra in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f015">Figure 15</xref>b,e, respectively. The main difference between the Li 1s spectra of the lithiated and delithiated anode is the existence of a peak at 55.1 eV in the lithiated stage, which is suspected to be LiSi that was observed in the XRD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f014">Figure 14</xref>a). Otherwise, peaks that are attributed to Li<sub>3</sub>N and Li<sub>2</sub>O are present in both lithiated/delithiated phases, which were also confirmed in the N 1s and O 1s spectra [<xref rid="B40-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The presence of the Li<sub>3</sub>N peak in the lithiated N 1s spectra and XRD analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f014">Figure 14</xref>) confirms the involvement of the sputtered Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> layer during lithiation. Two peaks were observed after deconvolution of the F 1s spectra of the lithiated anode in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f015">Figure 15</xref>d: LiPF<sub>6</sub> (688.6 eV) (the supporting electrolyte) and Li<sub>x</sub>PF<sub>y</sub> (686.2eV) [<xref rid="B41-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f015">Figure 15</xref>e, the lithiated and delithiated anode have identical spectra with three peaks corresponding to CuO [<xref rid="B42-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], Li<sub>2</sub>O [<xref rid="B43-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and SiO<sub>2</sub> [<xref rid="B39-materials-14-02824" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], with the exception of a higher binding energy shift observed in the delithiated phase. The lithiated and delithiated C 1s spectra in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-02824-f015">Figure 15</xref>f shows six and five peaks, respectively, that are attributed to various carbon bonds from the carbonates in the electrolyte, as well as the residual acetone that may have remained after cleaning the chamber and sample holder. Overall, XPS analysis has provided key insights and support for the results produced from the other analytical techniques, especially XRD analysis. The presence of Li<sub>2</sub>O, Li<sub>3</sub>N, and Li<sub>x</sub>PF<sub>y</sub> in the lithiated and delithiated anode indicates the formation of a stable solid&#x02013;electrolyte interface (SEI) by decomposition of the electrolyte. The stability of the SEI film confirms the good cycling stability of the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu anode.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec4-materials-14-02824"><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>In this endeavor, Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu as an anode material for LIBs was prepared via RF magnetron sputtering. This work involves the deposition of Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> on Si film as a possible solution to the cracking of the Si anode that results in poor electrochemical performance, which ultimately hinders the practical application of Si-based anodes in LIBs. Additionally, Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>@Cu and Si@Cu films were prepared for comparison. The pristine anode material was characterized using a series of analytical techniques: spectroscopy (Raman, XPS, EDX), microscopy (SEM and TEM), XRD analysis, and topography. Characterization results, mainly that of XRD and XPS, confirmed the successful deposition of Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> on Si@Cu film through RF magnetron sputtering. Various electrochemical tests were conducted to evaluate its performance in a half-cell (vs. Li<sup>+</sup>/Li) and full cell, including CV and GCD. Upon cycling, the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu anode was found to perform better, with higher specific charge/discharge capacities, at lower current densities (100 and 200 mA/g). The most significant finding in this work was the superior performance of Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu as LIB anode material compared to Si@Cu. The Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu anode achieved 90% capacity retention after 50 cycles, whilst only 20% of the capacity was retained for Si@Cu. Furthermore, excellent efficiency (100% up to 20 cycles) and reasonably high specific capacities were attained for Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu in a full cell with LFP, which already outperforms many commercial batteries today. Nevertheless, more work needs to be done in enhancing the specific capacity as the experimental value achieved in this work is still relatively low compared to the theoretical capacity. Post-mortem analysis was conducted to identify and assess any changes that occurred to the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>@Si@Cu anode after cycling and during the lithiated/delithiated stages. The formation of Li<sub>3</sub>N was confirmed by XRD and XPS analysis in the lithiated and delithiated phases of the anode, which can be indicative of the role of Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> as a protective barrier for Si.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors are grateful to the Central Laboratory Unit (CLU) team at Qatar University for helping with the analyses methods and for providing gases needed for the thin film preparation using the RF sputtering machine.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceptualization, H.M. and N.B.; methodology, H.M. and N.B.; software, Y.D.L.; validation, H.M., K.M. and N.B.; formal analysis, K.M., H.M., N.B.; investigation, K.M., H.M., and Y.D.L.; resources, H.M. and N.B.; data curation, Y.D.L. and K.M.; writing&#x02014;original draft preparation, Y.D.L., K.M., H.M.; writing&#x02014;review and editing, N.B.; visualization, N.B.; supervision, H.M. and N.B.; project administration, N.B. and H.M.; funding acquisition, N.B. and H.M.
