<p>Tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF
 <sub>6</sub>) (≥99.0%, electrochemical analysis), acetonitrile (MeCN, 99.8%, anhydrous), sulfuric acid (95–97%), hydrogen peroxide (&gt;30% w/v), potassium hydroxide (semiconductor grade pellets, 99.99%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used without further purification. Glassy carbon (GC) disks (HTW Sigradur® radius 2.5 mm) and B-doped Si wafers (MicroChemicals; resistivity 5–10 Ω cm) were used as substrate materials for carbon deposition.
