<p>XPS was performed in a VG Scientific ESCAlab Mk II system (&lt;2 × 10
 <sup>−8</sup> mbar), using Al Kα X-rays (1486.6 eV); core-level spectra were collected with analyzer pass energy of 20 eV and survey spectra were collected with analyzer pass energy of 200 eV. Peaks were fitted with Voigt functions after Shirley background subtraction using commercial software (CasaXPS); at.% compositions were obtained from peak area ratios after correction by Scofield relative sensitivity factors (C = 1.0, N = 1.8, O = 2.93). Raman spectra were measured in backscattering configuration using a Renishaw 1,000 micro-Raman system equipped with an Ar
 <sup>+</sup> laser with 488 nm excitation. The incident beam was focused by a Leica microscope with a 50× magnification objective and short-focus working distance; incident power was kept &lt;2 mW to avoid sample damage. Spectra were baseline corrected using commercial software prior to analysis (Wire 3.2).
