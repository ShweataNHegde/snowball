<p>Nitrogen-free amorphous carbon thin film materials were synthesized via magnetron sputtering followed by post-deposition thermal graphitization (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). DC-magnetron sputtering from a graphite target (99.999%) was carried out in a deposition chamber (Torr International) at base pressure &lt;2 × 10
 <sup>−6</sup> mbar; carbon was sputtered for 40 min onto GC disks at an Ar pressure of 2–7 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> mbar achieved at a flow of 50 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>, as previously reported (Cullen et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Behan et al., 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The resulting carbon films are topographically smooth, with thickness of 
 <italic>ca</italic>. 70 nm and with high graphitic content (&gt;80% sp
 <sup>2</sup>-centers) (Cullen et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Behan et al., 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Sputtered electrodes were then graphitized in a tube furnace under N
 <sub>2</sub> flow for 1 h at 900°C, resulting in graphitized amorphous carbon film electrodes with smooth topography (Behan et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). These materials were used as precursors for the creation of nitrogenated carbons via plasma surface modifications. Surface nitrogenation was carried out in a custom-built 25 mm O.D. quartz plasma chamber with a base pressure of 10–25 mbar, equipped with an induction coil connected to an RF generator (13.56 MHz, ENI). N
 <sub>2</sub> gas was fed at 20 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup> using a mass flow controller (Brooks Instruments), maintaining a pressure of 160 mbar during plasma treatments. The graphitized nitrogen-free electrodes were exposed to the N
 <sub>2</sub>-plasma at ~10 W RF coupled power for 5, 10, and 20 min.
