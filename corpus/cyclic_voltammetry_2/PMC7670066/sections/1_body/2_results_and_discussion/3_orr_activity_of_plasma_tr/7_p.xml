<p>In RRDE experiments the Pt ring electrode is used to quantify the amount of hydroperoxide produced at the disk electrode via the anodic reaction corresponding to the reverse of (2).

 <sup>âˆ’1</sup> in 0.1 M KOH. The onset of the ring current mirrors the onset of the disk current in all cases, thus confirming that hydroperoxide detected at the ring arises from the cathodic process taking place at the disk. The differences in ring current reveal significant differences in ORR selectivity at anC:N electrodes. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref> show the calculated yield of hydroperoxide (bottom) and average number of electrons transferred (top) as a function of potential. It is evident from these two figures that for the nitrogen-free anC electrodes the preferred product is hydroperoxide. All three plasma-treated materials show much lower yields of hydroperoxide and higher average number of electrons as reported in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The differences in selectivity among plasma-treated materials suggest that despite possessing the worst onset, anC:Np5 is the most selective toward the 4e reduction pathway.
