<p>The selectivity of plasma-treated anC:N electrodes toward the 4e reduction pathway was investigated using rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) experiments. The most desirable product of the ORR for energy applications is the one resulting from a 4e transfer, i.e., hydroxide/water; however, a partial 2e reduction to hydroperoxide is also possible, as below:</p>
