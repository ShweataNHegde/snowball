<p>It is interesting to compare ORR activity indicators obtained for plasma treated thin film electrodes, with those obtained for bulk N-doped and ammonia-modified thin film electrodes, also synthesized from sputtered precursors and reported in our previous work (Behan et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2019a</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). In the case of plasma-treated anC:N, all electrodes were based on a highly graphitized nitrogen-free precursor film that was then modified via low energy plasma, yielding predominantly pyrrolic-N and a progressively greater density of defects. The introduction of N-sites imparts ORR activity, as evidenced by improvements in E
 <sub>on</sub>, limiting current densities and selectivity, while contributions to the activity by O-sites resulting from plasma treatment might also play a role (Wu et al., 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) in the observed general improvement. However, N/C and O/C content, as well as functionality composition remain similar across anC:N materials and therefore do not fully explain the observed activity trends. On the other hand, the disorder/amorphization that accompanies plasma modifications appears essential for modulating the activity descriptors. A comparison of onset potentials shows that they follow the order anC:Np5 &lt; anC &lt; anC:Np10 &lt; anC:Np20. It cannot be ruled out that changes in the onset potentials may arise due to microscopic roughness. However, this appears unlikely, as the changes in interfacial capacitance cannot justify the observed E
 <sub>on</sub> trend: the minimum capacitance of anC is lower than that of anC:Np5, while that of anC:Np20 samples is smaller than that of anC:Np10. Therefore, we propose that the most probable origin of improved onsets is an increase in the concentration of structural defects, such as edges and bond distortions, which have been proposed to be active sites in the electrocatalysis of the ORR (Favaro et al.,
