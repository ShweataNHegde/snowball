<p>Finally, it is interesting to note that despite improvements in E
 <sub>on</sub> and values of 
 <italic>n</italic> = 3 resulting from nitrogen plasma treatments, none of the anC:N carbon film electrodes displayed the high E
 <sub>on</sub> values (0.83 V
 <sub>RHE</sub>) and remarkable selectivity (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4) observed for highly graphitized carbon thin films electrodes with low N/C content but ca. 50:50 ratio of pyridinic-N and graphitic-N (Behan et al., 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2019b</xref>). This suggests that the N-site composition remains critical for achieving the best performances. Further studies of model electrodes containing exclusively pyrrolic-N and controlled combinations of the same with pyridinic-N and graphitic-N might improve our understanding of synergies between these sites, as previously demonstrated by our group for other N-functionalities (Behan et al., 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2019b</xref>).
