<p>To investigate the effects of nitrogenation and amorphization on the capacitive properties we used an organic electrolyte of large ionic radii to minimize pseudo-capacitive contributions arising from redox functional groups at the carbon surface (Gerischer et al.,

The CVs display the characteristic shape of a capacitive response, while no faradaic peaks are discernible within the chosen potential window. Larger capacitive currents were observed at nitrogenated electrodes than at anC.
