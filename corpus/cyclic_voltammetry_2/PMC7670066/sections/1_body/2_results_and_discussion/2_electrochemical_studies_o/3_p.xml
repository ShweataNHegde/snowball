 <sup>+</sup>) for plasma-treated anC:Np5, anC:Np10 and anC:Np20 electrodes; the Bode plot of the nitrogen-free anC precursor is also shown for comparison. The nitrogen-free anC material displays a response close to that of an equivalent RC circuit, with a capacitive contribution dominant at low frequency and a resistive response at high frequency; the values of ϕ ≈ −70° at 0.1 Hz indicates deviations from ideal capacitive behavior, which instead should yield a value of−90°. The short 5 min exposure to plasma results in a significant reduction in the |Z| value at low frequency, relative to the nitrogen-free anC precursor. Interestingly, the ϕ value also decreases to

This is in agreement with Raman results which suggest that over short exposure times, nitrogenation might take place at the expense of amorphous surface regions. Further plasma exposure for 10 and 20 min leads to an additional decrease in |Z| value that plateaus between anC:Np10 and anC:Np20 electrodes. The phase plot shows evidence of an increase in the characteristic time constant in the order anC &lt; anC:Np5 &lt; anC:Np10 that is consistent with an increase in the interfacial capacitance, while for anC:Np20 it is possible to observe more pronounced deviations from ideality and evidence of at least a second partially resolved time constant. The EIS data therefore indicate that plasma treatments result in structural/electronic reorganizations of the carbon scaffold that progress over 5–20 min exposure times, despite the chemical N-functionalities remaining approximately constant at the carbon surface after only 5 min of exposure.
