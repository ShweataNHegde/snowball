<p>The chemical and structural characterization of anC:N materials indicates that they possess similar functional groups, with predominantly pyrrolic-N groups at the surface resulting from plasma treatments. Raman spectroscopy indicates that plasma exposure leads to increased amorphization and defect density in the carbon material, thus offering a route to exploring the effect of disorder on the capacitive, and faradaic electrochemical response of nitrogenated materials with similar surface functionalities.</p>
