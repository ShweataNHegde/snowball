<p>The structure of the carbon scaffold of the nitrogenated anC:N carbon materials was investigated via Raman spectroscopy; the Raman characterization of the nitrogen-free anC material has been reported elsewhere (Behan et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A–C</xref> show baseline-corrected Raman spectra in the 900–1,900 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> range of anC:Np5, anC:Np10 and anC:Np20, respectively; spectra are shown after normalization by the main peak intensity to facilitate comparison. All spectra display the characteristic peaks assigned to the G and D bands at ~1,580 and 1,380 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. The G peak is associated to stretching modes of carbon atoms in sp
 <sup>2</sup>-centers, in either rings or unsaturated chains. The D peak is associated to a breathing mode of sp
 <sup>2</sup>-centers in six-membered rings and it becomes Raman active if the symmetry of graphene clusters is broken due to the presence of defects (Ferrari and Robertson,

 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Ferrari et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Spectra were fitted using three Gaussian functions following previous methods (Laidani et al., 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Das et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Behan et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>): two functions were used to model G and D contributions, whereas the third one was introduced to model the A peak at 
 <italic>ca</italic>. 1,510 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. This third peak is ascribed to C-C stretching modes in the amorphous network that connects graphitic crystallites and that displays a mixture of three- and four-fold bonded carbon atoms (Laidani et al.,
