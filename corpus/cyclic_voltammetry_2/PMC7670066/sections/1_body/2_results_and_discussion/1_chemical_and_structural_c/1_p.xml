<p>Nitrogen-free electrodes were prepared in the form of thin solid films via magnetron sputtering from a graphite target onto GC disk electrodes, as shown schematically in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. Films were subsequently annealed under N
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere for 1 h at 900Â°C resulting in graphitized amorphous carbon electrodes (anC) (Behan et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), that were used as the precursor material for nitrogen functionalization. The anC electrodes were modified in a reactive N
 <sub>2</sub>-plasma for 5, 10, and 20 min resulting in electrode materials denoted anC:Np5, anC:Np10, and anC:Np20, respectively.
