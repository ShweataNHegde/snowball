 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> shows a comparison of the high resolution C 1s peak of the carbon electrodes. All C 1s spectra show an asymmetric line characteristic of amorphous carbon materials with a maximum at 
 <italic>ca</italic>. 284.5 eV, corresponding to the binding energy of sp
 <sup>2</sup>-centers in a graphitized scaffold (Díaz et al., 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). Plasma treatments result in an increase in the full width at half maximum (fwhm) of the C 1s peak (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), that is consistent with the introduction of heteroatoms and/or with changes in the degree of graphitization of the carbon structure (Maldonado et al., 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Behan et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The C 1s peak was fitted using four main components (Behan et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref> for anC:Np5: 284.4 eV corresponding to sp
 <sup>2</sup>-centers, 285.2 eV assigned to sp
 <sup>3</sup>-centers, 286.5 eV assigned to C-O/C-N groups, and 288.5 eV that can be attributed to C - O contributions. The spectral overlap between C–O and C–N peaks precludes a more detailed and unambiguous resolution of their contributions to the C 1s line (Perini et al., 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Behan et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Best-fit results of C 1s spectra of all carbon electrodes are reported in
