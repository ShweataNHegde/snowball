 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> shows XPS survey spectra of anC, anC:Np5, anC:Np10, and anC:Np20 electrodes. Spectra show the characteristic peaks of C 1s, O 1s, and N 1s photoemissions at ~285, 532, and 400 eV, respectively. The N 1s peak is absent in the case of anC, the N-free precursor material, as discussed in detail in previous work from our group (Behan et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), however, it is clearly detectable after only 5 min exposure to the N
 <sub>2</sub>-plasma thus indicating that this treatment leads to functionalization of the carbon electrode with N-sites. The amount of nitrogen and oxygen incorporated into the films was calculated from the area ratios A
 <sub>N1s</sub>/A
 <sub>C1s</sub> and A
 <sub>O1s</sub>/A
 <sub>C1s</sub>, respectively, after correction for the relative sensitivity factors; the at % composition thus calculated is reported in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The presence of oxygen likely originates from air exposure prior to characterization and residual water vapor in the quartz chamber. The compositional analysis shows that nitrogen and oxygen contents increase after 5 min of plasma treatment and plateau for longer plasma exposures. This suggests that the most significant changes in heteroatom content occur in &lt;5 min under our reactive plasma conditions.
