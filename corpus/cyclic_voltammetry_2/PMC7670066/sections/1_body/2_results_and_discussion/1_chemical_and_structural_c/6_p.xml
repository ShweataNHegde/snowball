<p>Spectral parameters obtained from the fits are shown in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; parameters for the nitrogen-free material are also reported for comparison. The results show that after plasma exposure there is an increase of the I
 <sub>D</sub>/I
 <sub>G</sub> ratio and of the fwhm value of G and D peaks relative to the nitrogen-free anC materials that is indicative of increased defects in graphitic regions (Ferrari et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Ferrari and Robertson, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Sadezky et al., 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Martins Ferreira et al., 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The I
 <sub>A</sub>/I
 <sub>G</sub> ratio decreases at first, relative to anC, likely due to rapid etching of amorphous regions connecting graphitized clusters. After longer times the I
 <sub>A</sub>/I
 <sub>G</sub> ratio instead increases, indicating that prolonged plasma exposure results in amorphization of the carbon scaffold. The parameter trends are consistent with a process involving, first, an increase in graphene edges/defects through reactive etching and modification of amorphous regions interconnecting graphitized clusters, followed by further amorphization at the expense of ordered graphitic clusters.
