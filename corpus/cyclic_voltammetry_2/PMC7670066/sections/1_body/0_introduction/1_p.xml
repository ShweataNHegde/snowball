<p>Carbon electrode materials are ubiquitous in energy applications due to several important desirable characteristics, namely, their earth-abundance, low cost, good scalability and processability, high conductivity, versatile morphology, tunable microstructure and crystallinity, and good mechanical properties (Georgakilas et al.,

 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Dou et al., 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Carbon materials have been widely explored for the fabrication of electrochemical capacitors, batteries and fuel cells (Inagaki et al.,
