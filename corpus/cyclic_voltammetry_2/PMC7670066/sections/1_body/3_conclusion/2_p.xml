<p>A combination of spectroscopic and electrochemical methods was used to study the composition and the electrochemical response of the materials in supporting electrolyte and in the presence of O
 <sub>2</sub> in alkaline solutions. The introduction of predominantly pyrrolic-N at the carbon surface was found to only slightly affect the electrochemical performance of the materials in the ORR, in the absence of enhancement in structural disorder. It is the combination of N-site and C-defects that appears to have the greatest effects on ORR activity affecting both onsets and selectivity. We attribute this to the availability of a higher density and a wider distribution of active surface sites available to the reaction which is evidenced also in changes in the interfacial properties observed via optical and impedance spectroscopy.
