<p>Our results suggest that structural defects in the carbon matrix play an essential role in imparting and modulating electrocatalytic activity at metal-free carbons. The nanostructuring that typically accompanies surface modification reactions is likely as important as the introduction of the localized heteroatom functionality and must be taken into account for the design of carbon electrodes with tailored reactivity.</p>
