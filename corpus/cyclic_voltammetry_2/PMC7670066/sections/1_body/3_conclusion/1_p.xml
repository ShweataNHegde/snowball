<p>In this work we used model thin film electrodes based on metal-free sputtered deposited amorphous carbon to investigate the effects of nitrogenation via plasma treatment on the electrochemical and electrocatalytic response of carbon materials. Sputtered and graphitized nitrogen- and metal-free carbon films were used as precursors to prepare model electrodes with different degrees of surface modifications. Plasma treatments result in both chemical and structural changes, as N-sites and C-defect sites were introduced following ion bombardment. Interestingly, chemical modifications occur rapidly and N/C concentration and N-site composition stabilize after relatively short exposure times; however, structural changes progress at slower rate. This provided us an opportunity to understand the individual contributions of chemical and structural changes to the overall electrocatalytic response of the materials in the ORR, an important reaction for sustainable energy technologies.</p>
