<p>The gold electrodes used in this study had a diameter of 1 cm resulting in a geometrical surface area of 0.785 cm
 <sup>2</sup>, while RRDE disk electrodes had a diameter of 0.5 cm and 0.457 cm and thus a geometrical surface area of 0.196 cm
 <sup>2</sup> (exchange disk electrode) or 0.164 cm
 <sup>2</sup> (thin gap disk electrode) respectively. Ring electrodes were also made of gold, while the theoretical collection efficiency (
