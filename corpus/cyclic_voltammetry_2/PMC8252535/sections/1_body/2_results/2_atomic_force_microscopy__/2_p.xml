 <sup>+</sup>. When the potential passed the onset of ORR, some particles are deposited on the surface appearing as noise in the Figure 
 <xref rid="cssc202100364-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c and these particles grow to a dense layer upon sweeping more negative than −0.8 V vs. Ag/Ag
 <sup>+</sup> (Figure 
 <xref rid="cssc202100364-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d,e). Then continuing in anodic direction after the negative potential limit of −1.27 V vs. Ag/Ag
 <sup>+</sup>, the particles seem to grow continuously until a potential of −0.5 V vs. Ag/Ag
 <sup>+</sup> is attained. The apparent growth of the particles during the anodic scan indicates a further deposition of solid CaO

 <sup>+</sup>, the interaction between the AFM tip and the electrode surface became unstable and the tip was retracted. The subsequent images therefore were recorded at a different position. Figure 
 <xref rid="cssc202100364-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>h was recorded after re‐approaching the tip. It is remarkable that the size of the particles is reduced at a more positive potential than −0.5 V vs. Ag/Ag
 <sup>+</sup>. We assume that the dissolution of peroxide leads to the reduced size, but this may also be caused by the shift in the scanned area. Figure 
 <xref rid="cssc202100364-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>i shows that the deposited particles seem to quickly dissolve at the potential of OER without any appreciable charge flow and the inset shows that the height of the deposited layer is around 30 nm. Furthermore, in a similar experiment (Figure S1), the potential was stopped at −0.65 V vs. Ag/Ag
 <sup>+</sup> (ca. −0.55 V vs. Pt/PtO) (after ORR) and images were taken every 3 min. After 6 min, the particles formed during ORR were gone during the scan. This observation further demonstrates the slow dissolution of the formed particles without oxidation and also explains that hardly any charge is flowing during the dissolution in Figure 
 <xref rid="cssc202100364-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>i. Note that the dissolution of the particles might have been accelerated by the scanning tip (e. g., by induced convection by moving AFM tip). This measurement clarified that a bulk layer of CaO
 <sub>2</sub> forms at the electrode in the absence of convection, but slowly dissolves without oxidation. However, at this point it is not yet clear whether the thick layer is the reason for the blockade of the electrode.
