<p>Comparing the ORR during cathodic and anodic sweep one observes a hysteresis, indicating a change in electrode activity, whereas for polycrystalline gold electrodes the hysteresis is smaller. This is plausible, as we assume the formation of an insoluble (adsorbed) CaO
 <sub>2</sub>/CaO layer on the electrode surface (this will be discussed in detail in the RRDE chapter below). This hysteresis was already found when comparing gold with Glassy Carbon in Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>‐containing DMSO.
