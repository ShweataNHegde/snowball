<p>The effect of electrode roughness is shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="cssc202100364-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. Overall, the cyclic voltammetry for Au does not change much with increasing roughness. The hysteresis is reduced, indicating less blocking for rougher electrodes. In the OER region, an oxidation peak only is clearly visible for the highest roughness factor. For all electrode roughness factors, the maximum absolute (limiting) current during the ORR remains the same, indicating that the CaO
 <sub>2</sub> formation really is diffusion limited. The half‐wave potential of the ORR shifts positively with increasing electrode roughness, owing to the increasing effective rate constant; this will be further analyzed below.
