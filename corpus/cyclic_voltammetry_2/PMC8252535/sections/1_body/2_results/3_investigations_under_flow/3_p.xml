<p>The absolute faradaic current increases to a plateau for the diffusion‐limited formation of predominantly CaO
 <sub>2</sub>, indicated by the number of transferred electrons (Figure 
 <xref rid="cssc202100364-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The number of transferred electrons starts from 
 <italic>Z</italic>≈2 (in case of Au(111) 
 <italic>Z</italic>≈1.7) at −1.1 V and stays constant during the remaining cathodic sweep. This in combination with the fact, that almost no reoxidation current is observed, leads to the assumption, that predominantly soluble CaO
 <sub>2</sub> is formed during the ORR on all gold electrodes, as already suggested in Ref. [21]. No strong effect of the single crystal surface structure is observed (only in case of Au(111), the number of transferred electrons during ORR is slightly lower compared to Au(100)/Au(pc); this effect might be due to a slight change in calibration constant of the spectrometer).
