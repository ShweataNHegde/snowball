 <sub>2</sub> containing DMSO. For higher roughness factors, the CV shape is similar to the DEMS case in the previous chapter; the ORR starts around −0.8 V in cathodic direction with peroxide formation. However, in case of the lowest electrode roughness (Figure 
 <xref rid="cssc202100364-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a), the decreasing reduction current indicates a transition from peroxide to superoxide formation. This transition from the 2 e
 <sup>−</sup> reduction to a 1 e
 <sup>−</sup> reduction had been found before and explained by the formation of a CaO/CaO
 <sub>2</sub> adsorbate layer, which had also been characterized by XPS.
