 </math> reoxidation at the lower potential limit corresponds to that expected from the disc current. The ring current caused by re‐oxidation of the generated peroxide does not increase with rotation frequency but decreases with time. This will be addressed further below. During the anodic scan only a small current for the OER is observed at the disk electrode visible in Figure
