 <sub>2</sub>/CaO film oxygen is exclusively reduced to superoxide. The continuous reduction is astonishing, as a layer of Li

 <sub>2</sub> almost completely inhibits further ORR on Au and Pt electrodes.

 </xref> As the electrode is regenerated by oxidative stripping, so that oxygen has access to the gold surface, peroxide is formed as predominant product, thus confirming our suggestion. The ring current shown in Figure S2 confirms superoxide (being completely re‐oxidized) or peroxide (being re‐oxidized to a small extent) as the main product. A very similar approach for smooth gold electrodes showed a stronger suppression of superoxide formation (Figure S2 and Ref. [29]). This is explained by the influence of the rough surface leading to a more defective CaO
 <sub>2</sub>/CaO adsorbate.
