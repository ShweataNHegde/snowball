 <xref rid="cssc202100364-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b,e,h) is much smaller than expected: it should be larger (oxidation of peroxide to oxygen) or at least as large (oxidation of peroxide to superoxide) as the ring current during superoxide formation. In the following we will show that this is due to sluggish oxidation kinetics by increasing the effective rate of peroxide oxidation at the ring electrode.
