<p>We already reported that the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>‚Äêcontaining DMSO on Pt, Rh, Glassy Carbon and Ru leads to a large extend to the formation of soluble Ca(O
 <sub>2</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> whereas on gold electrodes, the oxygen reduction reaction leads to the formation of soluble CaO
 <sub>2</sub>.

 </xref> To further understand the effect of the electrode and the electrode surface structure concerning the ORR, experiments on gold single and poly crystals were conducted.
