 <sup>−1</sup> after immersion at −0.5 V. Starting in cathodic direction, the absolute value of the current density increases to a maximum close to −1.0 V for the polycrystalline gold electrode. In case of Au(111) the feature at −1.0 V appears as a shoulder prior to a peak close to −1.25 V. In case of Au(100) no such feature close to −1.0 V is visible as the current increases to a maximum close to −1.15 V. After the maxima the current decreases, while in case of Au(111) and Au(100) a shoulder is visible in the decreasing current. Furthermore, the ORR onset in case of Au(111) is slightly shifted positive compared to Au(100) and Au(pc), which almost overlap during the ORR onset. After going to zero in anodic direction, the oxidation starts with a shoulder at −0.14 V, followed by a broad peak of low current in case of Au(100), a sharp peak of slightly larger current in case of Au(111) and a broad peak with a much larger current in case of Au(pc). After the change in sweep direction at 0.5 V, the current decays monotonously to zero in case of Au(111) and Au(100). In case of Au(pc) the current increases again to a maximum close to 0.25 V before it decreases to zero.
