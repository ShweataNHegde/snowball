<p>In this work, we investigated the influence of atomic surface structure and electrode roughness on the ORR in Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>‐containing DMSO and thus shed some light on the mechanism of oxygen reduction on gold surfaces. As we have shown, the atomic surface structure has a minor influence on the ORR in presence of convection. We found peroxide as main product during ORR both on single crystalline and polycrystalline gold surfaces as indicated by the number of transferred electrons in DEMS measurements under convection. Concerning the influence of electrode roughness, we found that a rough gold surface allows for continuous peroxide generation under the typical measurement conditions, whereas at smooth electrodes it is soon replaced by superoxide formation. However, under longer ORR without intermediate OER (i. e., oxidative stripping of the blocking adsorbate) peroxide formation is not maintained neither on the rough electrodes; instead, diffusion‐limited superoxide formation is observed, whereas at the smooth electrode the OER is completely suppressed after some time.
