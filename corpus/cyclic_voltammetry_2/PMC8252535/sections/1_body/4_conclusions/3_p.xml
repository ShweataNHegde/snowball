<p>The soluble peroxide and superoxide can be oxidized at a collector electrode in a generator collector arrangement (e.â€‰g., RRDE), but the kinetics of the reoxidation is slow for superoxide (due to stabilization in an ion pair with Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>) and even slower for the peroxide. In the absence of convection, the formed peroxide (either via the 2
 <sup>nd</sup> electron transfer at the electrode surface or possibly via disproportionation of the superoxide in solution) further deposits as CaO
 <sub>2</sub> particles on top of the CaO
 <sub>2</sub>/CaO adsorbate layer as indicated by AFM measurements in this study; these experiments also demonstrated that this peroxide can be dissolved.
