<p>Niâ€“Fe layered double hydroxides have been investigated for the first time for a hybrid battery-electrolyser application. Thus, battery properties, including storage capacity, rate performance, and cycling stability, as well as catalytic OER activity, have been characterised. The Fe doped materials appear beneficial from the following aspects:</p>
