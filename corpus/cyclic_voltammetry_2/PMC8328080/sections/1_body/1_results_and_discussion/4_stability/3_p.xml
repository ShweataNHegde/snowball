<p>On top of the capacity stability, the OER catalytic stability has also been observed. Fig. S-7 in ESI,
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">†</xref> shows the OER catalytic stability of the NiFe20 material over almost 200 hours of charge at 4C (∼4 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup>) and shows that the OER overpotential remains stable around 200 mV. In addition, the sample NiFe20 still shows a good high rate performance even after 1000 cycles (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5c</xref>). It is able to withstand a C-rate as high as 20C for both charge and discharge, still giving an excellent high number of electrons exchanged (0.8e
 <sup>−</sup>/Ni, or in other terms, 46% SOC can be reached in 3 minutes).
