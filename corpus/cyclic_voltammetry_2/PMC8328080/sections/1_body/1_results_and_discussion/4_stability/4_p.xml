<p>The stability of the alpha phase within NiFe20 is also confirmed by XRD and XPS analyses. The XRD diffractogram of the aged electrode (Fig. S-9 in ESI
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">†</xref>) highlights that the NiFe20 material is still essentially α-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> after 1000 cycles. A very small peak corresponding to β-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> is also observable and could explain the small decrease in capacity from 1.57e
 <sup>−</sup> to 1.4e
 <sup>−</sup> along the 1000 cycles. Nevertheless, the results indicate the high stability of the crystal structure. This is also beneficial for the mechanical stability of the electrode which, when a β-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> material is used, suffers from the swelling of the material. The surface composition of the aged NiFe20 electrode is analysed by XPS and compared to that of a fresh electrode (Fig. S-10, ESI
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">†</xref>). For both the fresh and aged electrodes, the high resolution Ni 2p spectra (Fig. S-10b, ESI
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">†</xref>) can be fitted into 2 spin–orbit peaks Ni 2p
 <sub>1/2</sub> and Ni 2p
 <sub>3/2</sub> at ∼855.6 eV and 873.31 eV with two satellite peaks indicating that Ni is in the +2 oxidation state.

 </sup> Binding energies for Fe 2p
 <sub>3/2</sub> and Fe 2p
 <sub>1/2</sub> are positioned at ∼712 eV and ∼725 eV confirming the presence of +3 Fe.

 </sup> Again, the spectra of fresh and aged electrodes are quite similar (Fe 2p
 <sub>3/2</sub> at 712.6 eV and 712.1 for the fresh and aged electrodes, respectively, and, Fe 2p
 <sub>1/2</sub> at 725.2 eV and 725.1 eV) which confirms the stability of the material. Further stabilisation of the electrode capacity will require mitigation measures to fix the electrode morphology, such as enclosing the active material in volume fixed metallic pockets, as well as operating at elevated pressures to reduce the volume of the gas bubbles (
 <italic>e.g.</italic> 10 Bar operation reduces this volume tenfold). The first approach is common in Ni/Fe batteries and the second in alkaline electrolysis.
