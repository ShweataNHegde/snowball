<p>Sample NiFe20, which gives the best capacity performance, has been exposed to a life cycle experiment to characterise its stability over the cycling. After the activation and C-rate experiments the electrode has performed 960 cycles at 4C charge, overcharge, and discharge. Mid-way in the life cycle experiments, 6 reactivation cycles at 0.2C were performed for every 100 cycles. Finally, at the end of the 960 cycles the electrode was re-pressed to its initial thickness to reconnect the material with the current collector, and the electrode was cycled again at 0.2C. In total the electrode performed 1000 cycles. The whole history of the electrode is represented as NEE in
