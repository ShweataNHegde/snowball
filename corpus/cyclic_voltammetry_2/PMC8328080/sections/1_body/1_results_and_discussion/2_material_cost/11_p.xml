<p>The OER potentials reached by all samples are above their equilibrium potential (0.28 V/Hg/HgO) but below the thermoneutral potential of OER (0.601 V/Hg/HgO), which is possible because of the external heat coming from the environment. Calculation for thermoneutral and equilibrium potential of OER is detailed in the ESI.
