<p>This shift towards higher potentials is also described by Demourgues-Guerlou

 </sup> who report an increase of the oxidising character of γ-NiOOH with Fe substitution due to the presence of tetravalent iron in the charged phase. To gain more insights into this question, the equilibrium potentials at half state of charge (SOC = 1/2) have been determined by GITT measurements. The equilibrium potential of the Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>/NiOOH redox couple is known to show a hysteresis behaviour, with the equilibrium potential 
 <italic>versus</italic> SOC being higher when measured during the charge than during the discharge.

 </sup> This hysteresis behaviour could be related to a structural change induced by the intercalation (during discharge) and removal (during charge) of the proton in the Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> structure causing a lattice expansion and contraction.

 <inline-graphic xlink:href="d1ma00024a-t4.jpg" id="ugt4" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/> obtained at SOC = 1/2 during the charge and discharge part of the GITT curve, respectively. Results are shown in Fig. S-4 (ESI
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">†</xref>). The results reveal that there is indeed an increase in the equilibrium potential with the iron concentration in Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>, reflecting a higher oxidation state.
