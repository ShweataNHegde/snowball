<p>The analysis of the (dis)charge curves of the different materials, shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3b</xref>, brings more insight into the cycling process. The shape of the charge and discharge curves, for example, reveals the composition of the material. The NiFe15 (dis)charge curves confirm the presence of two different phases (alpha and beta) highlighted by two plateaus visible in charge and discharge around the 100 mA h g
 <sup>âˆ’1</sup> position. This effect is less visible for NiFe7 suggesting that the transformation from alpha to beta is almost complete for this sample.
