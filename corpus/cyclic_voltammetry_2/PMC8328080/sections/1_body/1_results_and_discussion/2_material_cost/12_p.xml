<p>Sample Ni-B appears to offer more capacity than NiFe7 and NiFe15 when considering the specific capacity in milliamp-hour per gram of compound, while the estimation in NEE/Ni presented earlier gives a different tendency. This is explained by the higher Ni content per gram of the compound in the Ni-B material which does not contain Fe doping and has no water intercalated, which compensates for the lower NEE per Ni. However, for the sample NiFe20 both a higher specific capacity and a much higher capacity per Ni amount than the β-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> are reached. This indicates that despite the reduced Ni amount in the compound and the enhanced OER leading to a lower faradaic efficiency of the sample, the high number of electrons exchanged per nickel by NiFe20 enables the battery gravimetric energy density to be increased as well. Nevertheless, it has to be noted that some β-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> materials found in the literature have higher specific capacity than the Ni-B sample discussed in the present paper. For instance, the Co and Zn doped β-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> proposed by X. Yue
