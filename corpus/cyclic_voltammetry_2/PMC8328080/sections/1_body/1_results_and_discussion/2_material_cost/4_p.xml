<p>When comparing with the literature, the material NiFe20 appears more performing than the 20%Fe doped Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> proposed by L. Demourgues-Guerlou 
 <italic>et al.</italic>

 </sup> that shows a number of electron exchanged by metallic atoms (NEE/(Ni + Fe)) of 1.15e
 <sup>−</sup> for the first cycles before it decreases. In comparison, NiFe20 gives a NEE/(Ni + Fe) of 1.29e
 <sup>−</sup> at the end of the activation cycles. Also, all the doped materials studied in the present paper show a better capacity than the Zn doped Ni(OH)

 <italic>et al.</italic>

 </sup> which shows a capacity of 500 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup>(Zn) while NiFe7, NiFe15, and NiFe20 give, respectively, 574 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup>(Ni), 603 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup>(Ni) and 724 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup>. On the other hand, the cobalt doped Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> discussed by R. Oesten 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <sup>
  <xref rid="cit48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>
 </sup> gives a slightly better capacity with a NEE/(Ni + Co) a bit higher than 1.3e
 <sup>−</sup> compared to 1.29e
 <sup>−</sup> for the NiFe20 samples. To conclude, sample NiFe20 gives a capacity relatively close to the highest number of exchanged electrons (NEE) reported in the literature which is 1.7e
 <sup>−</sup>/Ni

 </sup> but, more importantly, this constitutes an increase by a factor of 1.8 per Ni atom compared to the conventional β-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>, and without any use of cobalt. The amount of nickel in the hydroxide material, is then almost halved for a similar capacity, which is a large reduction in the required nickel resources (and cost).
