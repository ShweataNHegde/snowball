<p>The difference 
 <inline-graphic xlink:href="d1ma00024a-t5.jpg" id="ugt5" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/> also decreases with the iron content. Nevertheless, the difference in equilibrium potentials 
 <inline-graphic xlink:href="d1ma00024a-t6.jpg" id="ugt6" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/> is similar for all the samples (about 0.055 V), which proves that the kinetic charge rate dependent overpotentials are decreasing with the iron doping. This indicates a superior charge transport within the NiFe-LDH samples. This is confirmed by the EIS measurements. Fig. S-5 (ESI
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">â€ </xref>) shows the Nyquist plots for each sample, they display a depressed semi-circle resulting from charge transfer resistance and a slope related to Warburg impedance in the low frequency region. The semi-circles are smaller for most of the Fe concentrated NiFe-LDH materials indicating an increased charge transport with Fe doping. The impact of the doping on the overpotential reduction can find different explanations. First, the ionic pathways with the stabilised large interlayer gap of the alpha structure will be enhanced, reducing ionic resistances; and second, doping enhances the electronic conductivity of the material.
