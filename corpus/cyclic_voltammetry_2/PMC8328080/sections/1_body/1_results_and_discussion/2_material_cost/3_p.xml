 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3a</xref> shows the evolution of the capacity along the 10 activation cycles at 0.2C for the three iron-doped samples compared to that of pure β-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>. As expected all the NiFe-LDH materials allow a higher number of electrons to be exchanged per nickel atom (between 1.15 and 1.57e
 <sup>−</sup>/Ni) than Ni-B that shows 0.86e
 <sup>−</sup>/Ni. From the doped samples, the NiFe20 material shows a much better performance than NiFe7 and NiFe15 which reach 1.15 and 1.23e
 <sup>−</sup>/Ni, respectively, at the end of activation. The electrochemical performance of the LDH materials can be correlated to their crystal structure. The interstratification of the alpha and beta phase layers in the crystal structure of samples NiFe7 and NiFe15 explains the lower capacity reached by these materials (
 <italic>cf.</italic> Material characterisation section). Indeed, only the alpha phase contains tetravalent nickel atoms allowing a higher number of electrons to be exchanged (NEE). In the interstratified material, the average oxidation state of nickel is then decreased by the presence of the beta phase layers. This interstratified structure is already observed before ageing for NiFe7. In the case of NiFe15, the transformation might occur during the preparation steps preceding the activation cycles (soaking of the electrodes and 1st long cycle) as well as during cycling. An assumption was made in the Material characterisation section that the ratio of the α/β phases was higher in NiFe15 after the ageing test than in the NiFe7 sample. This is confirmed by the higher capacity reached by NiFe15. The material NiFe20, which still showed a pure alpha phase after ageing in KOH, also gave the best results with 1.57e
 <sup>−</sup>/Ni.
