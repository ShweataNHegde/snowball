<p>The parameter considered in this study to characterise the capacity of the material is the number of electrons exchanged per atom of nickel (NEE) rather than the specific capacity (milliampere-hour per gram of compound). Although the latter is conventionally used in the battery literature, as it is related to energy density, in the stationary storage considered here, the Ni content and therefore the material cost are of relatively higher importance.</p>
