<p>Upon ageing in 6 M KOH, the various doped nickel hydroxides show sharper reflections suggesting an increased degree of crystallinity and an increase in the crystal size (

 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Only material NiFe20 shows a pure α phase after 1 month of ageing, although the interlayer distance experienced a decrease from 8.25 to 7.70 Å. This may be due to an exchange of SO
