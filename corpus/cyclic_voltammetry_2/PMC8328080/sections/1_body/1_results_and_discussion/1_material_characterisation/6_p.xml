<p>The number of water molecules intercalated in the nickel hydroxide plays an important role in the crystal structure and electrochemical properties. TGA is used to determine the amount of water present in the samples. The TG and DTA curves of the samples are shown in the ESI,

 <sub>2</sub>. The content of adsorbed and intercalated water is then estimated at 18 wt% for all the doped samples and 8 wt% for conventional β-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>, Ni-B, which only contains adsorbed water. The amount of nickel in the samples (wt%) was determined by ICP and used later for the determination of the number of electrons exchanged per nickel atom (
 <italic>cf.</italic> section Material cost). The amount of nickel in the samples (wt%) as well as the Fe/(Ni + Fe) molar ratio determined by ICP are displayed in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The ICP results confirm the iron doping of the samples at 7, 13 and 18% which is close to the expected value (7, 15, and 20%). A chemical formula of the different samples is proposed and discussed in the ESI.
