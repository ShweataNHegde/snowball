<p>The diffractogram of aged NiFe7 still shows an interstratified behaviour with a (003*) reflection now shifted to a higher 2

 <italic>d</italic> = 5.58 Å instead of 6.88 Å before ageing). This can be interpreted as an increase of the β-phase proportion within the interstratified structure. The positions of the peaks (003*) and (006*) are quite similar to those obtained by Rajamathi

 </sup> with their interstratified Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> obtained by alkali precipitation which shows a first peak at 5.6 Å and a second peak at 4.2 Å. They conclude from DIFFax simulation that this material contains 60% of beta phase. The material NiFe15, which was showing pure α phase before ageing, also shows an interstratified structure now, with the shift of the (003) reflection to a higher 2
 <italic>θ</italic> angle (6.07 Å instead of 8.64 Å before ageing). The diffractogram appears indeed quite similar to that of NiFe7 before ageing.
