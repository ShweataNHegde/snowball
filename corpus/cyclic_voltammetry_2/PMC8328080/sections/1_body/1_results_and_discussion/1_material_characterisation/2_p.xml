<p>The material NiFe7 (α-Ni

  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub>(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> with 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.07) shows a peculiar X-ray diffractogram. Similarly, in the α-phase, the two reflections (003) and (006), that represent 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>Hex/3</sub> and 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>Hex/6</sub>, are observed below 2
 <italic>θ</italic> = 30°. However, unlike for NiFe15 and NiFe20, their positions are not submultiples of one another (6.88 Å and 4.39 Å instead of 8.25 Å and 4.15 Å for material NiFe20) indicating that they cannot be indexed as the (003) and (006) reflections of an α-phase. Therefore, we will refer to these reflections as (003*) and (006*). This effect has already been observed by L. Guerlou-Demourgu 
 <italic>et al.</italic>

 </sup> for a low trivalent cations concentration (&lt;20 mol% in their case). It is typical of an interstratified structure where α and β-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> domains coexist within a single crystallite. Estimation of the 
 <italic>β</italic>/(
 <italic>β</italic> + 
 <italic>α</italic>) ratio has been proposed in the literature by comparison of the experimental XRD patterns with the simulated XRD spectra.

 </sup> It has been found that for extreme values of the 
 <italic>β</italic>/(
 <italic>β</italic> + 
 <italic>α</italic>) ratio, the XRD patterns are similar to those of the corresponding pure phase. The general appearance of the NiFe7 spectra corresponds better to an intermediate scenario with 
 <italic>β</italic>/(
 <italic>β</italic> + 
 <italic>α</italic>) close to 0.5. The interstratified material obtained by L. Guerlou-Demourgues

 </sup> for 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.1 showed a similar XRD pattern to sample NiFe7 with a first peak at 7.0 Å and a second one at 4.1 Å. By comparing the XRD pattern with simulated spectra they concluded that the ratio 
 <italic>β</italic>/(
 <italic>β</italic> + 
 <italic>α</italic>) in their sample is 0.55. In addition to these pseudo (003*) and (006*) reflections, the diffractogram of NiFe7 presents another particularity with an additional reflection at low angle (2
 <italic>θ</italic> = 6.85°, 
 <italic>d</italic> = 15 Å) which could be attributed to an extra periodicity E.P. (this extra reflection is discussed in the ESI
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">†</xref>). To conclude, a concentration &gt;10% is then necessary to obtain a pure α-phase after the alkali precipitation synthesis.
