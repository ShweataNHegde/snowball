<p>The XRD patterns of the as-prepared NiFe-LDH materials and a pure Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> material (synthesised following the same protocol) are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>. As expected, the nickel hydroxide material prepared without iron substitution, Ni-B, presents a pure beta phase with an interlayer distance of 4.7 Å related to the 
 <italic>d</italic>
 <sub>001</sub> reflection. The NiFe-LDH samples show low crystallinity with broad and asymmetric reflections which are characteristic of a turbostratic structure often observed in the alpha phase.

 <sub>003</sub>) of 8.64 Å for NiFe15 and 8.25 Å for NiFe20. A reduction of the interlayer distance with the concentration of iron was also observed by L. Demourgues-Guerlou

 </sup> and described as a result of the effect of an improvement of the interlayer cohesiveness induced by the increase in the electrostatic charge of the slab with the iron content. The Ni–Ni distance, represented by the 
 <italic>a</italic>-lattice parameter of the hexagonal cell, is 3.05 Å for NiFe15 and 3.00 Å for NiFe20. This variation is caused by the presence of the trivalent cation substituted for Nickel. As the ionic radius of Fe
