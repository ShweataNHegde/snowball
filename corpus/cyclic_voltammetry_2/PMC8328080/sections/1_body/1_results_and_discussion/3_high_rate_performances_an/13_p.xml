<p>For a conventional NiFe battery function, a high OER potential is necessary to have a good energy efficiency because it implies a higher faradaic efficiency of the cycling process. In contrast, for the hybrid battery-electrolyser function proposed here, the faradaic efficiency is not affected by the water splitting reaction because the hydrogen and oxygen are useful products. In this case, a decrease of the OER overpotential is even desirable to allow an improvement of the energy efficiency. The catalytic activity of the nickel hydroxide materials towards OER is characterised by chronopotentiometry with current densities ranging from 0.6 to 25 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup>. The advantage of characterising the OER catalytic activity by galvanostatic experiments instead of cyclic voltammetry is that, unlike with cyclic voltammetry, bubbles formed on the electrode can be removed before each point of the Tafel plot avoiding a reduction of the electrode active surface. Also, every point is obtained at a steady state. The results are displayed in Tafel plots in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4c</xref> and confirm that the doped nickel hydroxides outperform the pure nickel hydroxide in activity and kinetics. Indeed, both the overpotentials and the Tafel slope are lower for NiFe-LDH materials. Material NiFe20 shows a Tafel slope of 32 mV decade
 <sup>−1</sup> and an overpotential of 205 mV at 10 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup>, while the slope is of 39 mV decade
 <sup>−1</sup> and the overpotential at 10 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup> of 230 mV for Ni-B.
