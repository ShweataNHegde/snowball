 </sup> manage to reach 31 mV dec
 <sup>−1</sup> with their ultrathin NiFe-LDH and an overpotential of 210 mV at 10 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup>. Also, NiFe-LDH materials tested in the present study outperformed the well-known Ir/C catalyst which exhibits a Tafel slope of 40 mV dec
 <sup>−1</sup>.

 </sup> Due to these excellent catalytic properties NiFe-LDH can be used for efficient water splitting once the Ni/Fe hybrid battery is fully charged.
