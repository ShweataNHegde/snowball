<p>Unlike the kinetic loss, the hysteresis loss appears intrinsic to the structural changes of nickel hydroxide material during (dis)charge and is therefore unavoidable. It is also worth noticing that at a low C-rate (0.1C) this hysteresis loss is higher than the kinetic loss. For Ni-B it represents an energy efficiency loss of 1.6% while the kinetic loss is 1.4%. The same tendency is observed for the NiFe-LDH samples.</p>
