<p>Few studies have investigated the high rate performance of α-Ni(OH)

 </sup> Besides, it is often unclear whether the electrode theoretical capacity and the charge rate are calculated based on the theoretical specific capacity of β-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> (289 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup>) or of α-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> (490 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup>) and if the weight considered is the total sample mass (including the doping and the water content) or only the mass of the active species present in the sample. For these reasons, comparison with the literature is difficult. In this study the impact of the charging rate, C-rate, on the materials capacity has been evaluated by increasing the C-rate from 0.1C to 4C considering a theoretical specific capacity of 490 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup> and the total mass of the sample (doping and water included). Therefore, 0.1C corresponds to 49 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup> (≈0.1 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup>) and 4C to almost 2 A g
 <sup>−1</sup> (≈4 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup>).
