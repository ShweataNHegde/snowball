<p>The better catalytic behaviour of the NiFe-LDH material compared to that of the pure beta phase can be explained by the presence of iron in the material, which makes it a well-known OER catalysts. Recent studies have investigated the reason behind the enhanced activity of the NiFe-LDH compound focusing on defining the active sites and the role of Fe on the NiFe-LDH OER activity.

 <sub>6</sub> octahedra. DFT calculation showed that this structural motif results in near optimal adsorption energies of OER intermediates at the Fe sites leading to an increase in OER catalytic activity. Nevertheless, the superior catalytic activity of Fe-α-Ni(OH)

 </sup> have demonstrated that the crystallinity of the material also plays a role in the OER. They showed that a small crystal size, a low crystallinity and a large interlayer distance are favourable for an efficient OER due to more exposed active sites, lower charges transfer resistance, and better exchange ability with OH
 <sup>−</sup>. Therefore the good OER performance of the NiFe-LDH materials can also be attributed to their low crystallinity (
