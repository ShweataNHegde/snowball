 </sub>(OER). For a full cell charging with 
 <inline-graphic xlink:href="d1ma00024a-t29.jpg" id="ugt29" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/> at 4C, the OER energy efficiency losses are estimated at −3.2% for NiFe20 instead of −2.5% for Ni-B inducing a gain in energy efficiency of +0.7% for the doped sample. Combined with the gain in battery energy efficiency, the use of NiFe20 constitutes an increase in total energy efficiency of +1.1 to +1.4%; since the typical full cell efficiency is 80–90%,
