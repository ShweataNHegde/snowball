<p>Annual electricity generation from renewable energy sources is growing rapidly. Renewable electricity sources represent 26% of the world's electricity today and according to the International Energy Agency (IEA) it is expected to reach 30% by 2024.

 </sup> IEA expects solar energy to play the largest role in the rise of the renewable energy share. Due to their inherent intermittency, renewable energies can have a serious impact on the electricity market in times of over and under supply. This can lead to curtailment or decreased or even negative electricity prices caused by a serious mismatch of supply and demand. Germany's electricity prices have dropped below zero 22 times between 2011 and 2018. More recently in April 2020, during the Coronavirus crises, hourly day-ahead power in Europe dropped to negative prices for 6 consecutive weeks. Besides, electricity prices increase when a lack of renewable generation occurs and more and more fossil power backup is phased out. These examples prove the necessity for developing large scale energy storage systems to stabilise the electricity grid by load balancing diurnal and seasonal cycles, especially when the supply of renewables starts to outgrow the instantaneous demand.
