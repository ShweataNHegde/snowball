<p>To improve this hybrid battery electrolyser further, efforts must be made to reduce the material cost, improve high rate performances and increase the energy efficiency further. The main cost of the active electrode material lies in the nickel hydroxide compound, while the iron is relatively low in cost. In terms of energy efficiency, the nickel electrode also stands out for its lower intrinsic conductivity and for the OER overpotentials during electrolysis; both are determining parts of the energy efficiency loss. In this context, we focus here on the development of modified active material for the nickel electrode dedicated to the double battery-electrolyser functionality.</p>
