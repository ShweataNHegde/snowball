 </sup> These cations were also chosen for their poisoning effect on the OER reaction.

 </sup> However, in this work, OER has become an asset next to the battery functionality which makes other cation choices interesting. Iron offers the advantage of a good stability at the trivalent state;

 </sup> Indeed, recently NiFe-LDH has gained increasing attention in the water oxidation field and is now recognized as one of the most promising OER catalysts for alkaline media.

 </sup> Several studies reported that NiFe-LDH shows higher electrocatalytic activity and stability for OER in alkaline media than commercial precious metal based catalysts.
