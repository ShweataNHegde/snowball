<p>Commercial Ni electrodes are made of β-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> which is one of the two polymorphic forms of nickel hydroxide. The second form is α-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> which has been considered highly promising as the next generation cathode material for Ni-based batteries due to its higher theoretical specific capacity (490 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup>) in comparison to that of β-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> (289 mA h g
 <sup>−1</sup>). This alpha phase consists of positively charged β-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> layers intercalated by water molecules and anions (mostly counter-anions of the nickel salt used for the synthesis). The interlayer space is hence larger for the alpha phase (&gt;7.6 Å) than for the beta phase (&gt;4.6 Å) allowing a better pathway for ionic transfer. However, in the highly dehydrating alkaline electrolyte of the Ni/Fe battery (6 M KOH), the alpha phase rapidly converts to β-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>. The unique approach to stabilise α-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> is by partial substitution of Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> in the hydroxide layer by trivalent metal cations. Thus, the strength of the anion binding to the layer is enhanced by the increase of positive charges in the layer, allowing the stabilisation of the alpha phase. The alpha phase shows another advantage compared to β-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>. When overcharged, β-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> easily turns to γ-NiOOH which has a higher interlayer spacing of 7 Å, resulting in a large volume expansion of the electrode, while, during charge, α-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> also forms γ-NiOOH but starting from a similar interlayer spacing. The stabilisation of the alpha phase therefore limits the electrode dimensional changes during (dis)charge and overcharge (
