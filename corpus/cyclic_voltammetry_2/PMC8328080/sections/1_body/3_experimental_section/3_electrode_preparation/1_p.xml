<p>Pasted nickel electrodes were prepared as follows: 50% of Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub>, 25% of carbon super P and 25% of graphite were ground together before adding a polyethersulfone (PES) solution to the mixture (7 wt% in NMP) until a homogeneous slurry was obtained. The slurry was then pasted into a nickel foam which was cut beforehand in a disk-shape of 1 cm diameter, and treated under ultrasound for 3 min in HCl (4 wt%) and 3 min in acetone in order to remove the oxide layer. After pouring the active material into the nickel foam, the electrodes were soaked in water to induce the precipitation of the polymer by a phase inversion process.

 </sup> The electrodes were then dried under vacuum at 50–60 °C and pressed to a thickness of 0.1 mm (1/5 of the initial thickness) to ensure a good electric contact between the foam and the active material. The morphology of the electrodes has been observed by SEM (SEM-JEOL6010LA). The SEM images of NiFe20 electrodes before and after 1000 cycles are shown in Fig. S-8, in the ESI.
