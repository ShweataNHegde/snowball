<p>Fe-substituted nickel hydroxide materials containing 7%, 15%, and 20% (NiFe7, NiFe15, and NiFe20), were prepared by a simple chemical co-precipitation method. The precipitation is carried out a constant high pH to avoid the formation of iron(
 <sc>iii</sc>) oxides/hydroxides. A solution of iron and nickel sulphate salts mixed in the appropriate ratio was slowly dropped into a 2 M NaOH solution under stirring. The pH-value of the mixture solution is controlled to be 13.2–13.4 during the whole synthesis. The precipitate was separated from the solution by centrifugation and washed with deionised water (this procedure was repeated twice). The precipitate was then dried in a vacuum oven at 50–60 °C until a constant weight was reached. The obtained materials were then ball-milled at 200 RPM for 12 min. For comparison purposes, pure β-Ni(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> was synthesised following the same protocol. A schematic illustration of the synthesis procedure is proposed in Fig. S-2 (ESI
