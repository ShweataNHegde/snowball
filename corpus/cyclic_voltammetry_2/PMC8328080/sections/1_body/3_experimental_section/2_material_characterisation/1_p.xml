<p>The phase structure of the as-prepared and aged samples was identified using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with Co K
 <sub>α</sub> source (
 <italic>λ</italic> = 1.78890 Å, 35 kV and 40 mA) and LynxEye position sensitive detector. The scan data were collected in a 2
 <italic>θ</italic> range of 5–95° with a step size of 0.06° and a counting time of 15 s. TG and DTA measurements were performed using a TGA2 from Mettler Toledo under air flow and in a temperature range of 30–800 °C with a step of 10 °C per minute. The metal content of the prepared samples was analysed using an ICP-OES, Spectro Arcos EOP. XPS spectra was obtained using a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha XPS system equipped with an Al K-Alpha X-ray source and a flood gun for charge compensation of the sample. Parameters used for the measurements were: spot size, 400 μm; pass energy, 50 eV; energy step size, 0.1 eV; dwell time, 50 ms; 10 scans in the vicinity of the Ni 2p, C 1s and O 1s orbital binding energy and 25 scans in the vicinity of Fe 2p orbital binding energy.
