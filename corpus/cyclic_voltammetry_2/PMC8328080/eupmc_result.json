We have recently introduced the concept of a hybrid Ni/Fe battery-electrolyser (battolyser) for this application<sup>1</sup>. The hydrogen produced during the Ni/Fe cell charge and continued electrolysis can serve as chemical feedstock and a fuel for long-term storage, while the hybrid battery electrodes provide short term storage. Here, we present Ni-Fe layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDHs) for enhancing the positive electrode performance. The modified Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> material capacity, high rate performance and stability have been tested over a large range of charge rates (from 0.1C to 20C) over 1000 cycles. The Ni-Fe layered double hydroxides allow the capacity per nickel atom to be multiplied by 1.8 in comparison to the conventional \u03b2-Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> material which suggests that the nickel content can be reduced by 45% for the same capacity. This reduction of the nickel content is extremely important as this presents the most costly resource. In addition, Fe doped Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> shows improved ionic and electronic conductivity, OER catalytic activity outperforming the benchmark (Ir/C) catalyst, and long term cycling stability.
