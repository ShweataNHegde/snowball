<p>Firstly, it was shown that electron-withdrawing groups increased the potential of the molecule, while electron donating tended to decrease it. The position of the functional group relative to the active redox center (the pyrazine ring) played a major role as well, as the closer it was, the stronger the effect. Additionally, multiple charged substituent groups (carboxylate) on the pyrazine ring had a strong influence on the heterogeneous electron transfer kinetics, evident from the increased peak splitting. Degradation pathways can be hindered with the correct placement of functional groups, as seen in the case of DSMeQUI 
 <bold>20</bold> compared to QUI 
 <bold>6</bold>. Thus, it is of great importance to investigate and map different degradation processes that can occur to be able to design highly durable compounds. We also identified two degradation products present in electrochemically cycled QUI 
 <bold>6</bold>-containing electrolyte with a pH = 13, corresponding to quinoxaline-2-ol (
 <bold>8a</bold>) and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxaline (
 <bold>10b</bold>).
