<p>The different Î´ at the various concentrations for both signals 2,3 and 1 were noted and fitted using both the dimer model for aggregation from Horman and Dreux [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-02227" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and the isodesmic model [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-02227" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] (equations described in the 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-02227">Supporting Info., Figure S2</xref> and one fitting example is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02227-f010">Figure 10</xref>b). The model of Horman and Dreux assumes that only dimerization takes place, while the isodesmic model takes into account all the possible poly-aggregates. The same titration was performed also with QUI 
 <bold>6</bold> as analyte to understand the effect of the sulfonate groups on this phenomenon. Additionally, a positively charged trimethylammonium quinoxaline 
 <bold>21</bold> (DNMeQUI) was synthesized and analyzed in the same way to confirm to what extent the aggregation was hindered by electrostatic repulsion (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-02227">Supplementary Materials, Figure S3</xref>). The obtained best-fit values after fitting the two models to the data are tabulated below (
