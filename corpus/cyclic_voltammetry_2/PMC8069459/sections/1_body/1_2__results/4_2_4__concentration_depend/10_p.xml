<p>Using Equation (3) and the obtained aggregation constant, the effective number of electrons was computed for the three compounds (
 <bold>6</bold>, 
 <bold>20</bold>, and 
 <bold>21</bold>) and shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02227-f011">Figure 11</xref>. The impact of the aggregation on the effective number of electrons and the effectiveness of charged side-groups for reducing this problem are illustrated in
