<p>DSMeQUI 
 <bold>20</bold> was also studied at various pHs in buffered electrolyte solutions. The substituents in the 2,3 positions hinders OH addition, and therefore the second oxidation peak, thought to correspond to the OH addition was not observed. DSMeQUI 
 <bold>20</bold> appeared to have the fastest kinetics among all the substituted quinoxalines at pH = 3, as indicated by the small peak separation (red and black points on 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02227-f008">Figure 8</xref>b). At low pH values, multiple redox waves were visible both for QUI 
 <bold>6</bold> and for DSMeQUI 
 <bold>20</bold>, likely due to potential inversion, i.e., when the order of the two one-electron processes changed, resulting in separate peaks. Similar behavior was observed in pyrazine [
