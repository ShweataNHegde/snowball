<p>The potential of pyrazine 
 <bold>1</bold> (and its derivatives 
 <bold>10</bold>â€“
 <bold>15</bold>) is well past the thermodynamic hydrogen evolution limit and close to the kinetic hydrogen evolution limit. That is a possible obstacle for use in a RFB system for both safety issues and loss of efficiency. Therefore, a representative system of six differently-substituted quinoxalines (
