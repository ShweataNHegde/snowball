<p>QUI 
 <bold>6</bold> was further studied in unbuffered electrolyte solutions from pH 3.5 to about 13.5 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02227-f006">Figure 6</xref>). At pH 11, the average peak potential slope was equal to 44 mV/pH corresponding to 4 electrons and 3 protons, or 2 electrons and 1.5 protons. As shown from previous studies, the total number of electrons involved at low concentrations of QUI 
 <bold>6</bold> is around two [

The slopes of the peak reduction and oxidation potential vs. pH differed significantly, 25 and 63 mV/pH, respectively, indicating that the number of protons involved in the two processes are different. The slope of the reduction potential vs. pH was close to 29.5 mV/pH, which corresponds to two electrons and one proton, while for the oxidation it was close to 59 mV/pH corresponding to an equal number of electrons and protons involved, in this case two electrons and two protons.
