<p>A 5 mM solution of each analyte in 0.1 M KOH/0.9 M KCl was prepared and analyzed using voltammetry. Based on the shape of the voltammograms (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02227-f004">Figure 4</xref>), it was clearly visible that the reversibility of the redox couple was reduced, with increasing number of substituents present, for both types of substituents. This effect was especially pronounced in pyrazine-2,3,5,6-tetracarboxylic acid 
 <bold>15</bold>, where the peak separation grew to almost 2 V, indicating very slow electrochemical kinetics. There are several factors that could affect the electrochemical kinetics and cause the large peak separation; these include steric hindrance, electrostatic factors, hydrogen bonding, intra-molecular effects, and structural reorganization [

 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-02227" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In the methyl-substituted pyrazines (
 <bold>10</bold>–
 <bold>12</bold>), both the anodic and the cathodic peak were shifted negatively by similar values, indicating that the methyl group only affected the energy level of the pyrazine ring and not its kinetic behavior, since the separation of the two peaks remained the same. The average peak potential dropped by approximately 55 mV per methyl group, similar to the 50 mV reported by Swartz et al. in phosphate citrate buffers at pH &lt; 2 [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-02227" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The expected behavior from an electron-withdrawing group would be to shift the potential to more positive values [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-02227" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This clearly applied to the mono-substituted carboxylic acid pyrazine 
 <bold>13</bold>, wherein both oxidation and reduction peak shifted in the predicted direction. In contrast, in more densely-substituted pyrazines 
 <bold>14</bold> and 
 <bold>15</bold> the heterogeneous kinetics were affected with a dramatic increase in the peak split, indicating a much reduced electron transfer rate, obscuring substituent effects on the redox potential to some extent. Nevertheless a small increase in the redox potential with increasing number of substituents was detected for the carboxy-pyrazines (
 <bold>13</bold>–
 <bold>15</bold>) (slope = +44 mV per carboxy-group, see inset in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02227-f004">Figure 4</xref>b).
