<p>Pyrazine 
 <bold>1</bold> undergoes reduction to give 1,4-dihydropyrazine 
 <bold>1a</bold> through a coupled two electron, three proton transfer reaction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02227-f001">Figure 1</xref>). In cyclic voltammetry, at acidic pH (&lt;2) the two individual one-electron transfer processes are visible as two separated peaks, while the two peaks coalesce into a single peak at higher pH [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-02227" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Swartz and Anson performed a series of staircase voltammetric and polarographic measurements of substituted pyrazines (
 <bold>1</bold>–
 <bold>5</bold>) at pH 1 in a 0.1 M perchlorate electrolyte [

Under those conditions, the total number of protons and electrons involved were three and two, respectively, for all the substituted pyrazines; the reversibility of the different compounds was affected by the pH and the scan rate used. Electron-withdrawing groups such as in molecules 
 <bold>2</bold> and 
 <bold>3</bold> tended to increase stability and shift the redox potential to more positive values, while electron-donating groups (pyrazines 
 <bold>4</bold> and 
 <bold>5</bold>) showed the opposite behavior [

 <bold>1</bold> undergoes decomposition in aqueous solution that is acid–base catalyzed with the slowest decomposition rate at pH ~3 [
