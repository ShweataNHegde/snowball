The relatively low redox potential of pyrazine and quinoxaline is an attractive feature for a flow battery negolyte, but the limited stability of the reduced state of these molecules is a critical barrier to the utilization of these materials for energy storage. In this study we set out to investigate the properties of a set of pyrazine and quinoxaline derivatives to shed light on the effect of different functional groups, pH, and substitution patterns on critical parameters, such as redox potential, electrochemical kinetics, and molecular stability.
