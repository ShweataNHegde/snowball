<p>Both pyrazine and quinoxaline are stable aromatic compounds containing two nitrogen atoms in the ring. The lone pairs located on the nitrogen atoms are not delocalized in the aromatic ring and therefore provide a nucleophilic character to the molecule, and a weak basicity (pKa of the conjugate acid in the range 0.60â€“0.88). Furthermore, in contrast to the energy of the 
 <italic>p</italic> orbitals in benzene, 
 <italic>N</italic>-containing aromatic molecules have lower energy orbitals as a result of the greater electronegativity of the nitrogen atom compared to that of carbon. Lower-energy filled 
 <italic>p</italic> orbitals make the molecule less prone to react with nucleophiles but more reactive towards electrophiles [
