<p>Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and steady state rotating (ring) disk voltammetry (RRDV) were conducted with a CH 760E workstation potentiostat (CH instruments, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA). In both cases, a three electrode configuration was used with the working electrode (WE), being glassy carbon in CV, and a rotating ring disk electrode consisted of glassy carbon (disk) and gold (ring) in RRDV. The counter and reference electrodes in both cases were a coiled platinum wire and an Ag/AgCl (3 M NaCl) electrode, respectively. Battery cycling took place with a Biologic SP-300 potentiostat (Biologic, Seyssinet-Pariset, France). Before cycling, the solution were degassed with Ar to remove dissolved O
 <sub>2</sub>. Afterwards, Ar was blown over the solution to mitigate further O
 <sub>2</sub> ingress.
