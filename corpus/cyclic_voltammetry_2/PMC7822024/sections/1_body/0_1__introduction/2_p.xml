<p>Supercapacitors (or ultracapacitors), that possess higher energy density than traditional dielectric capacitors and deliver much higher power rates than batteries, are known to be at the leading edge of electrical energy storage research [
 <xref rid="B9-nanomaterials-11-00003" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In the past few decades, planar supercapacitors (SCs) have been extensively studied and used [

 <xref rid="B14-nanomaterials-11-00003" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] mainly due to their exceptional electrical properties such as fast charge and discharge rates, high power density, safety and long lifetime [

 <xref rid="B16-nanomaterials-11-00003" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Apart from their light weight and flexibility, they need further improvements of their energy storage and power delivery to enable use as wearable devices [

 <xref rid="B18-nanomaterials-11-00003" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Fiber-based SCs with diameters of about tens to hundreds of micrometers have lately been shown to be promising candidates as energy storage structures for wearable energy storage devices [

 <xref rid="B21-nanomaterials-11-00003" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Compared to conventional supercapacitive devices, fibrillar SCs are designed to meet the requirements of flexibility, foldability, lightness and conformability [
 <xref rid="B17-nanomaterials-11-00003" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Those presented features make them ideal candidates since they can be directly embedded as components into textiles using facile knitting/braiding techniques.
