<p>Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) is considered a promising material for SC electrodes mainly due to its excellent intrinsic properties such as high conductivity, high-redox active capacitance, good chemical and electrochemical stability and ease of processability [

 <xref rid="B31-nanomaterials-11-00003" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Among the most significant of these properties is water solubility and ease of use in wet-spinning which facilitated the fabrication of fiber SCs [

In an acidic medium, chitosan amino groups are positively-charged and can thus react with the “free” negatively-charged polystyrene sulfonate acid (PSS) groups of PEDOT:PSS, according to the polyionic complexation coagulation strategy [
