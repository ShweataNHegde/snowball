Formed wet-spun fibers exhibit suitable flexibility and mechanical properties while providing versatility in choice of materials and structures. The ability to be woven or knitted into fabric allows for wet-spun fibers to be utilized as SCs in wearable electronics. Recently, considerable effort has been devoted to developing so-called all-in-one fiber SCs wherein electrodes and solid electrolytes (as separators) have been integrated into a single entity.
