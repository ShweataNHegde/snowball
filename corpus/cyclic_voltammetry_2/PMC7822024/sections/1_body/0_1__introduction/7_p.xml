<p>With the final aim of developing compact, thin fibers as all-in-one tubular SCs, a facile coaxial wet-spinning approach was employed followed by a wrapping technique. Using this approach, long fiber SCs are achievable, where all the elements are integrated into one unified structure. Once produced, these fabricated fiber SCs may be easily incorporated into a textile form using knitting or braiding techniques.</p>
