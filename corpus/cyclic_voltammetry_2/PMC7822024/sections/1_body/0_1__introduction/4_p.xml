<p>In order to achieve an all-in-one SC device, a facile coaxial wet-spinning technique was employed allowing for the continuous production of coaxial fibers having a conductive core with a hydrogel sheath acting as the electrolyte. Coaxial wet-spinning involves two polymer feed solutions being injected into a coaxial spinneret and co-extruded into a bath while retaining a coaxial structure [

The second conductive layer was then incorporated using a facile conductive wrapping method whereby as-prepared core-sheath fibers (insulating sheath) will be covered with CNT layer. High ionic conductivity and appropriate mechanical properties are crucial factors in the selection of a solid-state electrolyte [
