<p>Using a novel coaxial wet-spinning approach followed by a facile wrapping technique we were able to fabricate a thin, flexible and lightweight asymmetric all-in-one fiber SC in an attempt to satisfy the requirements of high-performance wearable energy storage devices. The high dispersibility of PEDOT:PSS in water facilitated the preparation of well-dispersed and homogenous spinning formulations from which Chit-PEDOT fibers were continuously fabricated for the first time. A second thin conductive layer of CNT web was then used to cover the coaxial fiber surface through the wrapping. Integration of electrodes, solid electrolytes and separators into a single entity would simultaneously eliminate the need for involving a packaging process while the risk of creating a short circuit could be prohibited.</p>
