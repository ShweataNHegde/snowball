<p>The morphological, mechanical and electrochemical properties of these fiber-based SCs are discussed. The addition of 10% w v
 <sup>−1</sup> PEG into the PEDOT:PSS core was found to have a negligible effect on the spinnability of this formulation, whilst affording the consistent and crack-free spinning of a core component that could be maintained consistently without breaking into the sheath, as was confirmed in LV-SEM images. Sodium chloride with 1% w v
 <sup>−1</sup> concentration was chosen as the desired salt solution to be added to the electrolyte layer, giving the highest ionic conductivity of 15.1 mS cm
 <sup>−1</sup> in chitosan with lower standard deviations when compared to lithium chloride. Mechanical property results obtained from stress–strain curves for as-spun coaxial fibers showed a significant increase in robustness for them compared to results previously reported for PEDOT:PSS fibers by others. CNT-Chit-PEDOT fiber SCs were shown to have slightly decreased ultimate tensile stress values of ~134.8 MPa with ~4.5% ultimate strain, as a result of dissimilar responses to the applied stress from different sections of the fibers. Furthermore, the asymmetric all-in-one fiber SC showed reasonable electroactivities with total specific capacitances of 21.4 F g
 <sup>−1</sup> and extremely high-power density of 1399 W kg
 <sup>−1</sup>. This combination of good electroactivity, remarkable Young’s modulus and yield stress combined with the high flexibility of these fibers imply that they hold great promise for applications in wearable energy storage devices in the near future.
