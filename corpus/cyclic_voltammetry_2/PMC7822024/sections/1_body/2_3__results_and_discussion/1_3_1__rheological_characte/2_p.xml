<p>Under atmospheric pressure and constant temperature, the solution viscosity depends directly on the concentration of the dissolved polymer. Broad ranges of concentrations varying from 2–15% w v
 <sup>−1</sup> have been reported as practical, spinnable concentrations for chitosan [

 <sup>−1</sup> has been selected here as it is amenable to wet-spinning and results in a gel with high ionic conductivity. A concentration of 2.5% w v
 <sup>−1</sup> PEDOT:PSS dispersion has been shown to provide a “spinnable” dope, producing continuous fibers over several meters [
 <xref rid="B61-nanomaterials-11-00003" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. However, after wet-spinning of these dopes into the coagulation bath, the observation of coaxial fiber cross-sections under the scanning electron microscope has shown that the PEDOT:PSS core section has a non-integrated texture. In order to achieve uniform core, we have investigated the effect of adding PEG into the PEDOT:PSS spinning formulation. Adding PEG is also known to enhance the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS fibers [
 <xref rid="B33-nanomaterials-11-00003" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. We found that by adding 10% w v
 <sup>−1</sup> PEG, the spinnability of the formulation was unaffected, thereby affording a one-step fiber production method. In addition to this, a uniform core texture could now be obtained routinely enclosed within the outer sheath component.
