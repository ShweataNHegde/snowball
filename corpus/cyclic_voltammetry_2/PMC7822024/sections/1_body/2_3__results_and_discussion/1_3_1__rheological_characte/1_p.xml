<p>Viscosity is a key factor determining the selection of dopes for wet-spinning. With coaxial spinning, as it is needed to provide a continuous protective coating over the inner core material, the viscosity of the sheath spinning solution is particularly critical. The core component material must also possess a certain minimum viscosity to allow continuous spinnability. In addition to these, the proximity of viscosities of the two components is also an essential consideration for coaxial spinning.</p>
