<p>With increased shear rate, the viscosity of the PEDOT:PSS solution also decreased, again indicating a shear thinning behavior. The viscosity of the chitosan solution was higher than that observed for PEDOT:PSS dispersions at low shear rates. The viscosity of the 2.5% w v
 <sup>−1</sup> PEDOT:PSS dispersion was 4.8 Pa·s, while the viscosity of PEDOT:PSS with PEG added was approximately 6.7 Pa·s at shear rates close to zero (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00003-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The shear rates were calculated to be about ~94 s
 <sup>−1</sup> for Chit and Chit-NaCl as well as ~62 s
 <sup>−1</sup> for PEDOT:PSS (+PEG) solutions at the nozzle which resulted in a viscosity of ~2.4 Pa·s, ~1.39 Pa·s and ~0.95 Pa·s, respectively, during the spinning process (shown in
