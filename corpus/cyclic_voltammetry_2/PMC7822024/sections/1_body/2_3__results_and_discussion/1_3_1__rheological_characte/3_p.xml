<p>A spinning solution composed of 3% w v
 <sup>−1</sup> chitosan was found to have a viscosity of ~6.3 Pa·s. Increasing the shear rate, the viscosity decreased, an indication of shear-thinning behavior. The addition of a monovalent salt such as sodium chloride (1% w v
 <sup>−1</sup>) caused a slight decrease in the viscosity of the hydrogel due to electrostatic screening [
