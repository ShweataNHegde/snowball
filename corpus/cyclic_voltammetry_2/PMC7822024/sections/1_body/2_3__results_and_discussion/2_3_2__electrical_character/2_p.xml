 <xref rid="nanomaterials-11-00003-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows the ionic conductivity of the chitosan hydrogel with varying NaCl salt contents (0, 0.5 and 1.0% w v
 <sup>−1</sup>). As expected, the conductivity increased with increasing the salt content. It can be seen that 1% w v
 <sup>−1</sup> NaCl exhibited the highest conductivity with less variability (due to the smaller errors reported in 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-11-00003-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> based on three time measurements).
