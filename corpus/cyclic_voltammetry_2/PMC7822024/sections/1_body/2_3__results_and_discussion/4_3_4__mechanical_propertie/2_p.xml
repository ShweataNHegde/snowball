<p>Results obtained from stress–strain curves for as-spun coaxial and triaxial fibers showed a significant increase in robustness compared to the results previously reported for PEDOT:PSS fibers [
 <xref rid="B61-nanomaterials-11-00003" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Young’s moduli of fibers were calculated to be 3.9 ± 0.1, 5.2 ± 0.6 and 4.6 ± 0.3 GPa for Chit-PEDOT (without PEG), Chit-PEDOT (including PEG) and CNT-Chit-PEDOT fibers, respectively. The results indicate that the presence of a hydrogel sheath plays a major role in increasing Young’s modulus compared to the pristine PEDOT:PSS fiber. Coaxial fibers of Chit-PEDOT (without PEG) and Chit-PEDOT (including PEG) exhibited ~18% and ~57% enhancement in Young’s modulus compared to the PEDOT:PSS counterpart. After wrapping the CNT fibers, Young’s modulus decreased. The modulus of hybrid materials was found to be highly dependent on the interaction between the existing layers in the hybrid material given that the load distribution efficiency at the interphase is determined by the degree of adhesion between the components. Our results may be explained by the creation of a weaker interfacial adhesion between CNT segment and chitosan sheath in triaxial fibers compared to the bonding strength between PEDOT:PSS and chitosan in coaxial fibers. This limits the proper load transfer from the CNT to the other component and reduces the obtained modulus for CNT-Chit-PEDOT fibers.
