<p>Ultimate stresses (MPa), ultimate strains (%) and Youngâ€™s moduli (GPa) were measured for the Chit-PEDOT (with and without PEG) and CNT-Chit-PEDOT fibers. Cross-sectional areas were calculated as perfectly circular with diameters equal to the largest measured width of each irregular fiber. Average values of tensile strength and maximum strain were determined. The mechanical properties of as-prepared fibers are summarized in
