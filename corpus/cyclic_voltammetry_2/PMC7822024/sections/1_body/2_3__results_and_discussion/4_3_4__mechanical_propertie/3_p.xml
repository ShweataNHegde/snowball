<p>Analysis of the mechanical data also indicated ultimate stress of 125.0 ± 7.1 MPa with 15.8 ± 1.2% strain, 94 ± 3.5 MPa with 8 ± 1.9% strain and 160.3 ± 6.8 MPa with 7.5 ± 0.9% strain had been obtained for solid PEDO:PSS [
 <xref rid="B64-nanomaterials-11-00003" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], Chit-PEDOT (without PEG) and Chit-PEDOT (including PEG) fibers, respectively. In other words, there is a loss of ∼25% of tensile strain in hybrid Chit-PEDOT fibers compared to that of solid PEDOT:PSS fibers. This may be compensated for by the addition of PEG into the core of coaxial Chi-PEDOT fibers. This outcome can be explained by the creation of a strong homogenous interfacial connection between the core and sheath sections in the presence of PEG, which causes efficient stress transfer when strain is applied to a tensile specimen. Moreover, Chit-PEDOT (without PEG) fibers were shown to withstand less stress before breakage. Triaxial fibers of CNT-Chit-PEDOT were shown to have ultimate tensile stress of 134.8 ± 3.3 MPa with ~4.5 ± 0.4% elongation at breakage. The creation of multilayered fibers with different sections allowing different properties, as along with their dissimilar responses to the applied stress, maybe the reason behind this reduction.
