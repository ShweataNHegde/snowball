<p>Obtaining the right morphology is one of the most crucial steps in designing a multilayered structure. The internal and surface microstructure of dehydrated Chit-PEDOT (including and without PEG) and CNT-Chit-PEDOT fibers were imaged under SEM, and the results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00003-f006">Figure 6</xref>a–f. As is well known, wet-spinning yields fibers of a generally round or bean-shaped cross-section [
 <xref rid="B61-nanomaterials-11-00003" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Although hydrated coaxial Chit-PEDOT fibers indicated disk-shaped circular cross-sections (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00003-f006">Figure 6</xref>d), it fully collapsed into non-regular structures after dehydration, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00003-f006">Figure 6</xref>a. A clear boundary could be found between the two components (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00003-f006">Figure 6</xref>b). Looking at the surface pattern of coaxial Chit-PEDOT fiber in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00003-f006">Figure 6</xref>c showed that it displayed a non-uniform and irregular cross-section, while high magnification SEM images of CNT-Chit-PEDOT fiber surface (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00003-f006">Figure 6</xref>f) revealed a relatively dense arrangement of CNTs on fiber surface which are in contact with each other; also some short CNTs can be seen in the transverse direction creating T-junctions with aligned CNTs. The cross-sectional shape of CNT-Chit-PEDOT triaxial fibers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00003-f006">Figure 6</xref>d) displayed a bean-shaped irregular cross-section similar to those shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00003-f006">Figure 6</xref>a by Chit-PEDOT fiber with three distinct layers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00003-f006">Figure 6</xref>f) for which the CNT layer had a diameter of about 1–2 µm as repeated, elsewhere [
