<p>Stereomicroscopic images of the fiber surface and cross-section were obtained (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00003-f005">Figure 5</xref>a,b). The coaxial fibers showed linear uniform structures with the PEDOT:PSS (+PEG) core evenly loaded inside the chitosan sheath. The diameters of the Chit-PEDOT fibers were measured to be about 580 µm in which the core was about 340 µm. The cross-sectional images of the coaxial fibers obtained using LV-SEM, before and after the addition of PEG to the core component (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00003-f005">Figure 5</xref>c,d), revealed the effect of PEG in creating the crack-free consistent central core component. A porous, permeable texture is also noticeable in the chitosan constituent, which looks as if it has reduced in size after insertion of PEG (
