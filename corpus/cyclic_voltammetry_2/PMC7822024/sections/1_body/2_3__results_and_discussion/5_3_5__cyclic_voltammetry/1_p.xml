<p>The electrochemical behavior of triaxial CNT-Chit-PEDOT fiber-based SCs was investigated in 0.1 M PBS aqueous solution (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00003-f007">Figure 7</xref>). To investigate the optimal potential window of asymmetric SC, the electrochemical performance of each electrode was measured individually in a three-electrode system in 0.1 M PBS.
