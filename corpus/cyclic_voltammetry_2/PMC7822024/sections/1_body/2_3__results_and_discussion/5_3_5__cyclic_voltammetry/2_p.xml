<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00003-f007">Figure 7</xref>a, the PEG-doped PEDOT:PSS electrode presents a stable potential window toward oxidation and reduction between −0.2 and 0.4 V afterwards, while the CNT sheet covered electrode exhibits a stable potential in the range of −1.0 to 0 V, resulting in an extended potential window of 1.4 V for the whole assembled asymmetric SC. The near-rectangular shape of the CVs obtained from both active electrodes suggests that the overall internal resistance is low, owing to their high electroactivities. It is worth mentioning that the cotton-steel wire showed negligible electroactivity as tested.
