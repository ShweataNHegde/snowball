<p>Core-sheath fibers of chitosan-PEDOT:PSS (with or without PEG) (abbreviated as Chit-PEDOT for ease of use) were spun into a bath of 1 M aqueous NaOH (Ethanol/H
 <sub>2</sub>O: 1/5). The applied injection rate used for PEDOT:PSS dispersion was 15 mL h
 <sup>−1</sup> and 28 mL h
 <sup>−1</sup> for chitosan solution in order to provide sufficient time to cover the core material. Moreover, 28 mL h
 <sup>−1</sup> was determined to be the optimum rate for the sheath component injection resulting in the thinnest sheath that was still capable of supporting the core material structure. Once the sheath components were coagulated, the fibers were then transferred into an isopropanol bath for post-treatment. After that, they were soaked in a graded series consisting of 80/20, 60/40, 40/60, 20/80 and 0/100 ISP/Milli-Q water mixtures gradually over 24 h as a washing step. To make an electrical connection to the conductive core embedded within core-sheath fibers, a cotton-steel wire with an average diameter of ~25 µm was inserted into the fiber core while spinning.
