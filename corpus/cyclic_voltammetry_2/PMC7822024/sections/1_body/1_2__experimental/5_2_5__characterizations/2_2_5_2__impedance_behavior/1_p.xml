<p>The electrical impedance behavior of hydrogel samples (width = 5 mm, height = 6 mm) was measured using a custom-built impedance setup, described elsewhere [
 <xref rid="B58-nanomaterials-11-00003" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In brief, an oscilloscope (Agilent U2701A) and waveform generator (Agilent U2761A) were used to apply a range of frequencies at a peak-to-peak ac voltage of 0.8 V, while measuring the voltage drop across a known resistor (10 kÎ©) and the unknown hydrogel sample. The current was calculated across the known resistor and this was then used to calculate impedance behavior of the hydrogel samples as a function of frequency. Hydrogel samples tested varied in length (
