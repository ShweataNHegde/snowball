<p>The morphological properties of the dried coaxial Chit-PEDOT and triaxial CNT-Chit-PEDOT fiber surfaces and cross-sections were observed using a JEOL JSM-7500 FESEM, Japan. Samples for imaging were prepared by cutting cross sections in liquid nitrogen using a scalpel blade. They were then coated (EDWARDS Auto 306) with a thin (10 nm) layer of Pt to aid with imaging and minimize beam heating effects. Cross-sections were analyzed at 25 kV accelerating voltage and a spot size setting of 12 under high vacuum.</p>
