<p>Digital images and measurements of prepared fibers (in their wet state) were obtained using a Leica M205 stereomicroscope, Australia in tandem with LAS software, version 4.4. The surface and cross-sectional morphology of coaxial fibers were also examined in wet-state using a JSM-6490LV scanning electron microscope (SEM), MA, USA using the SMile View software. Images were recorded in high-vacuum mode at 15 kV operating voltage and a spot size setting of 45. Samples were prepared for imaging by immersion in simulated body fluid (SBF) beforehand until they were fully swollen, and then short lengths (about 5 mm) were removed, drained of excess medium and inserted into holes (~1 mm diameter) which had been pre-drilled into a small brass block. The block containing the mounted fibers was then plunged into liquid nitrogen for about 45 s. and a liquid nitrogen-cooled razor blade was run across the surface of the block to fracture the fibers. The block was then quickly transferred to the LV-SEM for examination.</p>
