<p>There are upper and lower practical limits which need to be considered in terms of suitable polymer concentrations for wet-spinning applications depending on the type of polymer as discussed in our previous works [
 <xref rid="B25-nanomaterials-11-00003" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-nanomaterials-11-00003" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In addition to this, viscosity is regarded as the primary criterion for the selection of suitable concentrations of materials for the purpose of coaxial spinning. Thus, an understanding of the rheological properties of spinning solutions is essential to determine the optimum conditions required for the spinning process. Changes in viscosity were recorded as a function of shear rate between 0.1 and 300 s
 <sup>−1</sup>. The rheological properties of chitosan (3% w v
 <sup>−1</sup> (with and without NaCl)) and PEDOT:PSS (3% w v
 <sup>−1</sup>) (with and without PEG) solutions were examined in flow mode (cone and plate method—60 mm diameter, 2° cone angle) using a digital rheometer- (AR G2, TA Instruments, New Castle, DE, USA).
