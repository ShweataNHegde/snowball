<p>Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of an optimized asymmetric supercapacitor were collected over different potential windows from 0.8 to 1.4 V with scan rates ranging from 10 to 1000 mV s
 <sup>âˆ’1</sup>, respectively to evaluate the electrochemical (EC) properties of asymmetric supercapacitor fiber and 50 cycles were performed. To investigate the optimal potential window of asymmetric supercapacitor, the electrochemical performance of each electrode was first measured using an E-Corder 401 interface and a potentiostat (EDAQ) in a three-electrode cell with Ag/AgCl, Pt mesh and deoxygenated 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) aqueous solution as the reference electrode, counter electrode and electrolyte, respectively. The cotton-steel yarn which has already inserted into the inner PEDOT:PSS core of coaxial fibers was used to make an electrical connection.
