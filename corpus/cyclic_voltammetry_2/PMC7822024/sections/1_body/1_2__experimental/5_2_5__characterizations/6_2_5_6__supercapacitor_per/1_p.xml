<p>Galvanostatic charge-discharge experiments of asymmetric supercapacitor were carried out at a current density of 0.5 A g
 <sup>âˆ’1</sup> as well as different potential windows from 0.8 to 1.4 V by using a battery testing device (Neware Technology Ltd., China) in a two-electrode system in deoxygenated 0.1 M PBS aqueous solution. The cells were discharged galvanostatically to a cut-off cell voltage of 0.01 V.
