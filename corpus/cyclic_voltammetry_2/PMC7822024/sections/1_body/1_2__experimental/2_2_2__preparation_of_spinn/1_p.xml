<p>For the purpose of coaxial spinning, a chitosan solution was prepared such that the final concentration was 3% w v
 <sup>−1</sup>, as described in our previous work [
 <xref rid="B25-nanomaterials-11-00003" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Furthermore, 2.5% w v
 <sup>−1</sup> aqueous dispersions were made from PEDOT:PSS pellets. The dispersions were then homogenized (Labtek IKAR T25) at 18,000 rpm for 15 min, followed by 1 h of bath sonication (Branson B5500R-DTH). Finally, polyethylene glycol (PEG) (10% w v
 <sup>−1</sup>) was added as-prepared dispersion directly and further homogenized at 18,000 rpm for 2 min, followed by 10 min bath sonication.
