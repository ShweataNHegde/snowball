<p>For fabrication of triaxial CNT-Chit-PEDOT fibers, directly drawn nanotubes from a spinnable synthesized MWNT forest were wrapped around the surface of the as-prepared coaxial Chit-PEDOT fibers layer by layer (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00003-f001">Figure 1</xref>b), as previously reported [
 <xref rid="B57-nanomaterials-11-00003" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. After wrapping, drops of ethanol were applied to condense the MWNT layer and promote the interaction between the CNT and the fiber layers.
