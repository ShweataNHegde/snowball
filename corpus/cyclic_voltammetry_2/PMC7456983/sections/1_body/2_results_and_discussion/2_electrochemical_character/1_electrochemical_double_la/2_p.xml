<p>Discharge curves (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5C,D</xref>) display a linear time–potential relationship in any case, as expected for a double-layer capacitance charge storage mechanism. On the one hand, BAG exhibits a capacitance of 134 F·g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 1 A·g
 <sup>−1</sup> and 129 F·g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 10 A·g
 <sup>−1</sup>, which represents 96% capacitance retention when the applied current is ten-folded. On the other hand, CS has a capacitance of 95 F·g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 1 A·g
 <sup>−1</sup> and 86 F·g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 10 A·g
 <sup>−1</sup>, corresponding to 90% capacitance retention at 10 A·g
 <sup>−1</sup>. Whereas, BAG has higher capacitance and better capacitance retention, CS is active in a slightly larger electrochemical window (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). Both materials exhibit excellent capacitance retention at higher applied currents, indicating their potential for high-power applications.
