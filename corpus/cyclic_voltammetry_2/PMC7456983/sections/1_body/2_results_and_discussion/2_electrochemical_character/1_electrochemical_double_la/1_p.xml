<p>BAG and CS wine biowaste–derived materials have been investigated as potential electrode materials in EDLCs. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A,B</xref> displays cyclic voltammetry results of the carbon-based materials in 1 M KOH in the −1.1 to 0.15 V range for CS and in the −1.0 to 0.1 V electrochemical window for BAG at different scan rates. Both present a quasi-ideal capacitive response at low scan rates. Nonetheless, when comparing the performance of both samples at scan rates over 200 mV·s
 <sup>−1</sup>, CS displays a tilted cyclic voltammogram, associated to increased resistance whereas BAG's cyclic voltammetry maintains its shape even at the scan rate of 350 mV·s
 <sup>−1</sup>.
