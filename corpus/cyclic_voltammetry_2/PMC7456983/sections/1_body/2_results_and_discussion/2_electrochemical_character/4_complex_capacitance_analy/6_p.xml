<p>The electrochemical performance of a material is the result of its morphological character, chemical composition, and their interaction with the electrolyte. As observed by means of N
 <sub>2</sub> adsorption experiments, both materials present great microporous surfaces, being slightly larger for BAG. This bagasse-derived carbon also possesses higher order and graphitic nature, as revealed by Raman and XPS. Therefore, this enhanced structure and chemical composition are reflected in the final electrochemical results, leading to lowered system resistance, as observed by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, affecting final capacitance and performance at higher scan rates and applied currents. All these factors result in a better electrochemical performance of BAG when compared with CS. Nonetheless, both materials present excellent performance as negative electrodes for electrochemical energy storage. Therefore, BAG and CS can potentially be reinserted in a circular economy approach after their chemical activation.
