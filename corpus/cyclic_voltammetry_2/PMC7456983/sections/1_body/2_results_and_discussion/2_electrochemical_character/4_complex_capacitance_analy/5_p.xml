<p>Finally, EIS is evaluated after the first and last discharge curve during the cycling stability test (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Three main features can be observed after 5,000 cycles. First, there is a 10% increase in the ESR. Second, the charge-transfer resistance for CS is maintained whereas for BAG it is slightly reduced to 126 mOhm. Third, both materials present almost identical behavior at mid- and low frequencies before and after continuous cycling, with the exception of CS at frequencies below 0.5 Hz, that presents a slightly decreased phase angle to −82° and BAG at frequencies lower than 0.03 Hz, which decreases its phase angle in 2°. Considering these results altogether, the integrity of the energy storage process, correlated to the active surface and porosity of the activated carbon, is maintained through continuous charge–discharge, thus retaining most of the initial capacitance of the material, as observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>, but a slight increase in system resistance for BAG, probably as a result of pore clogging leading to a smaller capacitance retention than for CS. Nonetheless, both materials show excellent properties for electrochemical double layer applications.
