<p>Capacitance retention was evaluated after 5,000 continuous charge–discharge cycles at 10 A·g
 <sup>−1</sup> and presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>. CS retains ~98% of its initial capacitance, resulting in a capacitance of 84 F·g
 <sup>−1</sup> after the electrochemical cycling stability evaluation. Alternatively, BAG has a slightly lower capacitance retention, with 120 F·g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 10 A·g
 <sup>−1</sup> after 5,000 cycles as compared with the initial 129 F·g
 <sup>−1</sup>, which represents 93% capacitance retention. Although CS shows slightly better performance, both materials display good capacitance retention after continuous charge–discharge, as expected for carbon-derived materials.
