 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> presents a brief review of previously reported activated carbons obtained from winemaking wastes applied in electrochemical energy storage for comparison purposes. The results obtained in this work display comparable performance, even when high currents are applied. In addition, cycling stability is evaluated for the first time, to the best of author's knowledge, in wine biowaste-derived carbons.
