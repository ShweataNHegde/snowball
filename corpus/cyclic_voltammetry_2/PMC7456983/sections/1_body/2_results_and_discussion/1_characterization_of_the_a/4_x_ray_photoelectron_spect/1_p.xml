<p>XPS measurements were performed to investigate the chemical composition of the samples. Asymmetric broad photoionizations were found in both cases (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4A,B</xref>). The deconvolution of the C 1s core-level spectra shows four different peaks, which can be assigned to the sp
 <sup>2</sup> carbon bonding, C–O bonding, C=O bonding, and π−π
 <sup>*</sup> transitions (Estrade-Szwarckopf, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Jerng et al., 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Dwivedi et al., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The binding energy values found for the main peak were 284.5 eV for BAG and 285.0 eV for CS. A slight shift toward lower binding energies was found. In addition, a difference in the width of the curve is appreciable when comparing both samples. These spectra are consistent with the presence of a main band with binding energy at 284 eV that corresponds to graphite, with a distortion of the peak, resulting from the appearance of disorder in the structure. The maximum of the CS photoionization appears at higher binding energies than the BAG sample and its width is considerably higher owing to this disorder. The obtained results reveal that the CS sample exhibits a lower graphitization degree, in good agreement with the obtained Raman results. π−π
 <sup>*</sup> transition peaks are the result of the stacking of the graphitic portion. C–O/C=O signals exposed the presence of oxygen-containing surficial groups, which appears in carbonization processes in presence of oxygen and can only be eliminated at very high temperatures (Estrade-Szwarckopf,
