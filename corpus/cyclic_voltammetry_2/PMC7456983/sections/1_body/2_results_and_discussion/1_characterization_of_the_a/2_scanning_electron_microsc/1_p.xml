<p>SEM micrographs for the BAG and CS activated carbon samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A,B</xref>) exhibit a microporous microstructure. A large number of pores can be observed, caused by the chemical interaction between the precursor surface and the activation agent (KOH). The obtained pores were irregular and oval, like embedded deep holes typically observed after chemical activation (El-Naggar et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Ravichandran et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). BAG images denote areas with material agglomerates, where porosity is found between these mass portions. Oppositely, images of carbon obtained from CS reveal low aggregated rates with larger porosity, which is in accordance with the results of nitrogen adsorption experiments.
