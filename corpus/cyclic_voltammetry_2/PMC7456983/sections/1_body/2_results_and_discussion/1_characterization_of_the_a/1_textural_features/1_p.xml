<p>The textural properties of the activated carbons were assessed by N
 <sub>2</sub> adsorption–desorption isotherms (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). For both activated carbons, the adsorbed N
 <sub>2</sub> volume (cm
 <sup>3</sup>·g
 <sup>−1</sup>) significantly increases with the relative pressure (
 <italic>P</italic>/
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>) for relative pressures below 0.1, which indicates the presence of microporosity in both samples. At higher relative pressures, hysteresis loops were found, indicating the presence of mesopores (Beltrame et al., 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). These results reveal the presence of both micropores and mesopores. According to the IUPAC (Thommes et al., 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), the obtained shapes correspond to type I and type IV isotherms, respectively. The volume of N
 <sub>2</sub> adsorbed was lower for the BAG sample than for the CS sample. However, the micropore volume (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) was similar for both activated carbons. The total pore volume for the BAG sample was lower than for CS (0.8 and 1.4 cm
 <sup>3</sup>·g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively). Also, the average pore sizes were 1.2 and 1.7 nm (lower than 2 nm in both cases), revealing that the obtained activated carbons mainly exhibit a microporous structure (Nič et al., 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The obtained results could indicate that the CS sample exhibits a greater number of mesopores. For this reason, the total volume of N
 <sub>2</sub> adsorbed was the highest. Finally, the specific surface areas were calculated using the Dubinin and the BET equations. Although the BET equation shall be carefully interpreted for microporous materials, it is widely used for determining the specific surface area of porous carbons (Guardia et al., 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Therefore, BET surface areas are included for comparison purposes. The obtained values were 1,337 and 1,861 m
 <sup>2</sup>·g
 <sup>−1</sup> for the BAG sample and 1,194 and 2,662 m
 <sup>2</sup>·g
 <sup>−1</sup> for the CS sample. The calculated BET surfaces were higher than the obtained total surface areas from the Dubinin equation, which could be associated to pore sizes being higher than 1 nm. In these cases, the BET equation tends to overestimate the results, as previously reported in literature (Centeno and Stoeckli, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).
