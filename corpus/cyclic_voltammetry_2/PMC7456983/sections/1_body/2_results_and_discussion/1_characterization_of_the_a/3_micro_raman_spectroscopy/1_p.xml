<p>Two predominant bands can be observed in the Raman spectra for CS and BAG samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) with peaks at around 1,350 and 1,600 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. As previously reported for carbonaceous materials (Sfyris et al., 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), these bands can be attributed to A
 <sub>1g</sub> and E
 <sub>2g</sub> modes, also known as D and G bands, respectively. The D band indicates the disorder and degree of defective structure, whereas the G band is related to the graphitization of the samples. The intensity ratio (

 <sub>D</sub>/
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>G</sub>) can provide information about the disorder and graphitization degree of the activated carbons (Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Yagmur et al., 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Furthermore, it has been reported that overlapped bands in the range 1,400–1,500 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> can be observed for amorphous carbons (Shimodaira and Masui, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). For the obtained carbon-based materials, in both cases, the D band was more intense than the G band. The calculated ratio of the D and G Raman signal was 1.08 and 1.1 for BAG and CS, respectively. In addition, a broadening of the D band for CS was found. Thus, the obtained results indicate that the CS sample exhibits a higher disorder degree than BAG.
