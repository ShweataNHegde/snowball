<p>Activated carbons were generated from BAG and CS, winemaking wastes generated in the production of Albariño wine (Denomination of Origin “Rias Baixas,” Galicia, Spain). These biowastes were supplied by Mision Biológica de Galicia (CSIC). Both BAG and CS were separately ground to achieve a grain size of &lt;2 mm. After that, aqueous suspensions of 75 g·L
 <sup>−1</sup> were prepared. The mixtures were introduced into a high-pressure reactor at 523 K for 3 h and 30 bar. Then, the aqueous suspensions were filtered through a pressure filter, obtaining the activated carbon precursors. Finally, these were chemically activated with KOH (1:2 ratio) in a tubular oven under a N
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere (150 mL·min
 <sup>−1</sup>) at 1,073 K for 2 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the obtained activated carbons were washed with MilliQ water until a neutral pH was achieved. These materials are henceforward denominated BAG and CS.
