<p>To evaluate the electrochemical properties of the activated carbons, a slurry was prepared using standard conditions reported elsewhere (Gören et al., 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), that is, by mixing 80% of active material, 15% conductive carbon, and 5% PVDF dispersed in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone. The slurry was impregnated on Toray Carbon Paper, which serves as conductive substrate, and then dried at 40°C for 12 h. Electrochemical performance was evaluated using 1 M KOH electrolyte in a three-electrode cell configuration. The coated carbon paper, a 2.5 × 2.5 cm
 <sup>2</sup> platinum foil, and a saturated calomel electrode were employed as working, counter, and reference electrode, respectively. The electrochemical tests were performed in a Gamry Instruments IFC1000-07087 potentiostat. Cyclic voltammetry was performed at scan rates from 10 to 350 mV·s
 <sup>−1</sup>. Galvanostatic charge–discharge curves were obtained in the range −1.0 to 0.1 V at different specific currents (1–10 A·g
 <sup>−1</sup>). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies were performed after holding the electrode for 2,000 s open circuit potential to ensure signal stabilization, by applying a sinusoidal perturbation with 10 mV amplitude in the frequency range from 0.01 to 10
 <sup>5</sup> Hz. Material stability was tested by continuous galvanostatic charge–discharge experiments at 10 A·g
 <sup>−1</sup> during 5,000 cycles.
