<p>Although previous studies have reported the use of activated carbons from winemaking waste for energy storage applications (Jim√©nez-Cordero et al., 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Guardia et al., 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), most literature focuses on their performance in two-electrode systems. Studying their performance in three-electrode systems is key to understanding their applicability in asymmetric and hybrid devices. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, the study of electrochemical properties for this type of materials has been scarcely investigated in certain cases, without an in-depth investigation on their cycling stability or their performance at high applied currents.
