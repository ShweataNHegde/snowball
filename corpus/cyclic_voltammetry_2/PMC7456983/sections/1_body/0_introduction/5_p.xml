<p>EDLCs store energy in the form of electrostatic charge at the electrode–electrolyte interface. Large active surface area materials are required to attain large capacitance values, and, for that reason, active carbons are generally used. In contrast to classical batteries, there is no Faradaic reaction involved, which would imply diffusion-controlled chemical reactions in the material that imply slower response. Therefore, EDLCs exhibit better power capabilities (Lei et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and the absence of chemical reactions allows to extend their useful lifetime to over 100,000 charge–discharge cycles.
