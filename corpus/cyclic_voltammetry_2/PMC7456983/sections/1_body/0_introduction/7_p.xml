<p>In the present work, the preparation of activated carbons from both winemaking wastes, bagasse (BAG), and cluster stalks (CS), is described. Hydrothermal carbonization as pre-treatment of chemical activation is used to obtain activated carbons with improved specific surface. Textural properties, and structural and morphological characterization have been investigated by several techniques, and their applicability to electrochemical energy storage systems has been addressed. The electrochemical performance of the obtained activated carbons from winemaking wastes is investigated using 1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte.</p>
