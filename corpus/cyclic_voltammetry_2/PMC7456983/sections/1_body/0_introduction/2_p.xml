<p>In this sense, obtaining activated carbons from waste is, currently, one important goal. Practically any raw materials with high carbon content, including several wastes, may yield interesting and useful materials (Deiana et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Various waste sources have been proposed for the preparation of activated carbon, from biodiesel (Gonçalves et al., 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) to food processing waste (Ramón-Gonçalves et al., 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Senophiyah-Mary et al., 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Yaglikci et al., 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) or agriculture industry residues (Ukanwa et al., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), all of them with great attractiveness owing to their large-scale production and low price. Winemaking-derived waste is a major issue in the wine industry, being Spain, the origin of the precursor wine used in this work, the third world producer of wine (Maicas and Mateo, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Among others, a great amount of skins, seeds, and stems left are generated in the process (Mingo et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In this sense, bagasse is the residual material obtained after the pressing of grapes to extract the must, and contains grape skin, pulp, and seeds. Cluster stalks are waste generated after the grapes are removed from their woody support.
