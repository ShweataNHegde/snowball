<p>Different methods have been used to obtain activated carbons such as carbonization/leaching (Deiana et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), pyrolysis (Rajamani et al., 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), impregnation with several activation agents (Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), demineralization (Chan et al., 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), or extraction with organic solvent (Jim√©nez-Cordero et al., 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), among others. However, these processes need high-temperature treatments, increasing the total cost of the process, and usually yield materials with low specific surface areas with limited use. To increase cost-effectiveness while improving the final properties of the resulting material, hydrothermal pre-carbonization is gaining attention for the preparation of carbon-based materials from several biowastes (Jain et al., 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The benefits of this process as pre-treatment of precursor biowaste are two-fold. One the one hand, it reduces the total cost of the production because hydrothermal carbonization followed by chemical activation leads to increased efficiency of the subsequent activation process. On the other hand, the two-step process improves the microstructural features of the final material and, as a result, the properties of the activated carbon can be tailored to the application.
