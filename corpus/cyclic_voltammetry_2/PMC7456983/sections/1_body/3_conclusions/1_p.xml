<p>Activated carbons were obtained from different winemaking wastes, bagasse (BAG) and cluster stalks (CS), by a hydrothermal process and subsequent chemical activation with KOH. This process leads to activated carbons with specific surfaces of 1,861 and 2,662 m

 <sup>−1</sup> for the BAG and CS samples, respectively. As adsorption–desorption N
 <sub>2</sub> isotherms reveal the presence of micropores and mesopores in both samples. Raman spectra for both activated carbons exhibit two predominant bands assigned to the D and G bands, typical of carbonaceous materials. In addition, Raman measurements indicate that the CS-derived sample exhibits a higher disorder degree than BAG. The electrochemical properties of these activated carbons are studied for electrochemical double-layer capacitor applications. Capacitance values of 129 and 86 F·g
