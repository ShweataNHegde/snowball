 <p>Revalorizing organic biowaste is critical to achieve a full circular economy, where waste is transformed into resources. One of the main strategies is to produce activated carbons and use them as functional materials for electrochemical energy storage. In this study, winemaking wastes, bagasse (BAG), and cluster stalks (CS) were recovered and used in the preparation of activated carbons by a hydrothermal process. Then, they were chemically activated using KOH and investigated for electrochemical capacitor applications. The activation treatment resulted in microporous structures, characterized by a type I isotherm for low partial pressures (

Micro-Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements displayed bands associated to disorder of the structure of the carbonaceous material. The electrochemical performance of the resulting materials was investigated for electrochemical energy storage applications, as supercapacitor electrode, in 1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. These biowaste-derived materials displayed electrochemical double-layer capacitance, with 129 F·g
