 <p id="Par1">As bifunctional oxygen evolution/reduction electrocatalysts, transition-metal-based single-atom-doped nitrogen–carbon (NC) matrices are promising successors of the corresponding noble-metal-based catalysts, offering the advantages of ultrahigh atom utilization efficiency and surface active energy. However, the fabrication of such matrices (e.g., well-dispersed single-atom-doped M-N
  <sub>4</sub>/NCs) often requires numerous steps and tedious processes. Herein, ultrasonic plasma engineering allows direct carbonization in a precursor solution containing metal phthalocyanine and aniline. When combining with the dispersion effect of ultrasonic waves, we successfully fabricated uniform single-atom M-N
  <sub>4</sub> (M = Fe, Co) carbon catalysts with a production rate as high as 10 mg min
  <sup>−1</sup>. The Co-N
  <sub>4</sub>/NC presented a bifunctional potential drop of Δ
  <italic>E</italic> = 0.79 V, outperforming the benchmark Pt/C-Ru/C catalyst (Δ
  <italic>E</italic> = 0.88 V) at the same catalyst loading. Theoretical calculations revealed that Co-N
  <sub>4</sub> was the major active site with superior O
  <sub>2</sub> adsorption–desorption mechanisms. In a practical Zn–air battery test, the air electrode coated with Co-N
  <sub>4</sub>/NC exhibited a specific capacity (762.8 mAh g
  <sup>−1</sup>) and power density (101.62 mW cm
  <sup>−2</sup>), exceeding those of Pt/C-Ru/C (700.8 mAh g
  <sup>−1</sup> and 89.16 mW cm
  <sup>−2</sup>, respectively) at the same catalyst loading. Moreover, for Co-N
  <sub>4</sub>/NC, the potential difference increased from 1.16 to 1.47 V after 100 charge–discharge cycles. The proposed innovative and scalable strategy was concluded to be well suited for the fabrication of single-atom-doped carbons as promising bifunctional oxygen evolution/reduction electrocatalysts for metal–air batteries.
