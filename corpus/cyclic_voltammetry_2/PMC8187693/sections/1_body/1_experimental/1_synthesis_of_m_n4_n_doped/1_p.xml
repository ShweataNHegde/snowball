<p id="Par32">The metal (Fe, Co) phthalocyanine (~ 95%, Sigma-Aldrich, Korea) was dissolved in aniline (100 mL; &gt; 99%, Junsei Chemical Co., Ltd., Japan) for 1 h upon magnetic stirring to achieve a concentration of 1 mM. Then, two high-purity graphite electrodes were discharged in this solution at a voltage of 1.2 kV, a frequency of 25 kHz, and a pulse width of 0.9 μs for 20 min (Pulse Modulator, MPP04-A4-200. Japan), with the assistance of an ultrasonic homogenizer (Korea Process Technology Co., Ltd., KSC-80, 25 kHz) [
