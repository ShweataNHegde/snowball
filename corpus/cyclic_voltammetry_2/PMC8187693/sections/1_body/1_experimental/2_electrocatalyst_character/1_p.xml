<p id="Par33">Morphologies and elemental distributions were probed by field-emission scanning transmission electron microscopy (FE-STEM; HD-2300A, Hitachi, Japan) at an operating voltage of 200 kV. Individual elements were identified by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS; JEM-ARM200F, JEOL, Japan). Crystalline phases were identified by XRD analysis (Ultima IV, Rigaku, Japan). Nanocomposite graphitization degree, irregularities, and imperfections were characterized by Raman spectroscopy (VERTEX 80v, Bruker, Korea). Surface chemical states were identified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; Kratos Analytical Ltd., Axis Supra, UK). The absolute metal contents of carbon catalysts were probed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (Optima 8300, Perkin Elmer, USA). Fe K-edge- and Co K-edge-extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra were recorded according to fluorescent patterns using the TPS 44A1 beamline (situated in the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC) of Taiwan, China) at an energy of 3 GeV and an average current of 250 mA [
