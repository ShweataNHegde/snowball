<p id="Par35">For OER analysis, LSV measurements were conducted in O
 <sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1 M KOH at a scan rate of 5 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup> and a rotation rate of 1600 rpm within the potential range 1–1.8 V versus RHE. CA measurements were performed at 1.6 V versus RHE for 5000 s to investigate catalyst cycling stability, while CV measurements were performed at 100 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup> for 3000 cycles in the potential range 1–1.6 V versus RHE. Electrochemical impedance spectra were recorded in a frequency range from 100 kHz to 100 mHz at 0.9 V versus RHE. For comparison, 20 wt % Pt/C (product code: 591278-1, Fuel Cell Store, USA) and 5 wt % Ru/C (product code: 1002653245, Aldrich Co., Ltd. USA) were used as benchmark ORR and OER catalysts, respectively.
