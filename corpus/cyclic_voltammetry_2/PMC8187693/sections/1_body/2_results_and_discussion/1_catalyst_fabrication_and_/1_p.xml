 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> presents the synthesis of M-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC (M = Fe, Co) electrocatalysts via ultrasonication-assisted plasma engineering. The prepared M-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NCs were converted into isolated single-atom M-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NCs by 2-h annealing in N
 <sub>2</sub> at 550 °C. In addition, NC was synthesized from pure aniline as a control. The production rates of M-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC and NC were close to 10 mg min
 <sup>−1</sup>, which agreed with values reported for similar processes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging and elemental mappings (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a–d and h–k, respectively) showed that Co-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC and Fe-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC contained the respective metal, N, and C. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (insets in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, h) had ringlike features indicative of poor crystallinity and the absence of metal nanocrystals. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) bright-field imaging demonstrated the presence of several graphitic carbon layers with a lattice spacing of ~ 0.34 nm directed toward the (002) plane of Co-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC and Fe-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e, o, respectively). Aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images of Co-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC and Fe-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC revealed the presence of isolated single-atom Co and Fe sites (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f, p, respectively). The atomic-level distributions of Co and Fe were further characterized by EELS. When the electron beam was directed at various positions (yellow regions in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f and red regions in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>p), the obtained EELS spectra showed distinct small peaks of atomic Co and Fe (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>g, q, respectively). The metal contents of Co-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC and Fe-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry as 0.26 and 0.29 wt %, respectively. The above findings support the successful fabrication of dispersed single-atom Co-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC and Fe-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC electrocatalysts.
