<p id="Par42">The metal valence states and chemical environments of M-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NCs were further probed at the atomic level by XANES and EXAFS spectroscopy. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a presents the Co K-edge XANES spectrum of Co–N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC and those of Co foil, CoO, Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>, and CoPc as four control references. Co–N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC presented a pre-edge peak at 7708.5 eV, a value identical to that observed for cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc), which suggested the presence of a planar Co–N
 <sub>4</sub> coordination environment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Besides, the Co peak of Co-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC was located between those of CoO and Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>, i.e., the Co oxidation state lied between +2 and +3. Furthermore, the Fourier-transformed 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>-weighted 
 <italic>x</italic>(
 <italic>k</italic>) function of EXAFS spectra in 
 <italic>R</italic>-space was used to quantify coordination numbers and bond lengths. For Co-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b), a prominent peak at 1.47 Å was observed, corresponding to the first coordination shell of Co-N. This peak was highly similar to that of atomically dispersed Co-N bonds observed for CoPc [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The EXAFS fitting results of Co-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c, d) revealed the existence of Co–N bonds (peak at 1.47 Å), with the corresponding coordination number of the central Co atom determined as ~ 4, which agrees with the planar structure of Co-N
 <sub>4</sub>. (The proposed local atomic structure is illustrated in the inset of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>.) The wavelet transform was further used to analyze the Co K-edge EXAFS spectra of Co-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e shows that for Co-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC, the maximum intensity was observed at ~ 3.5 Å
 <sup>−1</sup>, which is very close to the value of Co-N in CoPc (~ 4 Å
 <sup>−1</sup>), but quite distinct from that of Co foil (~ 6.7 Å
 <sup>−1</sup>), CoO (4 Å
 <sup>−1</sup> &lt; and/or &lt; 7 Å
 <sup>−1</sup>), and Co
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> (5 Å
 <sup>−1</sup> &lt; and/or &lt; 7 Å
 <sup>−1</sup>). Therefore, Co-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC was concluded to contain atomically dispersed planar Co-N
 <sub>4</sub> motifs.
