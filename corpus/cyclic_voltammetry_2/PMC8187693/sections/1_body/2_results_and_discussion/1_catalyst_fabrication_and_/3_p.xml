 <sup>2</sup> C = C (284.6 eV), C–N/C–O (285.1 eV), and N–C = O (286.8 eV). The high-resolution N 1s spectra of Co-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC and Fe-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b, e, respectively) showed three major peaks at 398.7, 400.5, and 401.0 eV, which corresponded to pyridinic, graphitic, and metal-bound nitrogen, respectively. In particular, the sharp peak of metal-bound nitrogen confirmed the existence of single-atom active sites, which are expected to contribute to enhanced ORR and OER activities [

 <sub>4</sub>/NC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c) showed spin–orbit doublets at 781.6 eV (Co 2p
 <sub>3/2</sub>) and 796.3 eV (2p
 <sub>1/2</sub>), as well as two satellite peaks at 788.4 and 802.5 eV. The peak spacing of 14.7 eV between the two peaks of Co 2p
 <sub>3/2</sub> and Co 2p
 <sub>1/2</sub> indicated the presence of both Co
 <sup>2+</sup> and Co
 <sup>3+</sup> [

 <sub>3/2</sub> peak, the surface atomic ratio of Co
 <sup>2+</sup>/Co
 <sup>3+</sup> was calculated as 1.54. Similarly, the high-resolution Fe 2p spectrum (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d) featured two spin–orbit doublets at 711.3 eV (Fe 2p
 <sub>3/2</sub>, split into two small peaks of Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> and Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>) and 722.8 eV (Fe 2p
 <sub>1/2</sub>). The Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>/Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> surface atomic ratio was calculated as 1.26 from the results of Fe 2p
 <sub>3/2</sub> peak fitting. The above findings confirmed the presence of M–N bonds in M-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NCs [
