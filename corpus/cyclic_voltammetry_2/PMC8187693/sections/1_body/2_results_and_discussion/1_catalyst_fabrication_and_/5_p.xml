<p id="Par43">Similarly, the Fe K-edge XANES spectrum of Fe–N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC was compared to those of three reference materials: Fe foil, Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>, and Fe-Pc (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). The spectrum of Fe–N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC featured a pre-edge peak at 7114.8 eV, which was identical to that of iron phthalocyanine (Fe-Pc) with a distinct Fe-N
 <sub>4</sub> planar structure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Moreover, the peaks of Fe-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC were located between those of Fe and Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>, i.e., the above catalyst contained Fe
 <sup>0</sup> and Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b presents the Fourier-transformed 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>-weighted 
 <italic>x</italic>(
 <italic>k</italic>) function of the Fe-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC EXAFS spectrum in 
 <italic>R</italic>-space, revealing a prominent peak at 1.53 Å that is significantly different from that of Fe foil and Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>, but is highly similar to that of planar Fe-N coordination in Fe-Pc [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. The results of Fe-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC EXAFS spectrum fitting (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c, d) revealed a peak of Fe-N at 1.53 Å, with the coordination number of the central Fe atom determined as ~ 4, showing that the Fe atom is coordinated to four N atoms in the planar structure. The proposed local atomic structure of Fe-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC is presented in the inset of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d. The wavelet transform of Fe-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>e) demonstrates only one peak with a maximum at ~ 4 Å
 <sup>−1</sup>, which is relatively close to the value of Fe-Pc (~ 3.9 Å
 <sup>−1</sup>) and completely different from those of Fe foil (~ 8 Å
 <sup>−1</sup>) and Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> (3.5 Å
 <sup>−1</sup> &lt; and/or &lt; 8 Å
 <sup>−1</sup>). Therefore, Fe-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC was concluded to contain atomically distributed planar Fe-N
 <sub>4</sub> units. The results of detailed X-ray analyses suggest that the ultrasonication-assisted plasma engineering process allows one to preserve the unique planar Co-N
 <sub>4</sub> and Fe-N
 <sub>4</sub> coordination motifs within the NC matrix. Even at a low dopant content of &lt; 0.3 wt %, the unique electronic structure and coordination environment of atomic metal-N
 <sub>4</sub> units could apparently enhance the ORR/OER activity of carbon-based electrocatalysts.
