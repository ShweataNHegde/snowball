<p id="Par40">The XRD patterns of as-prepared M-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NCs and pristine NC (Fig. S3) featured similar broad peaks at 23° and 43°, which were indexed to the (002) and (101) planes of graphitic carbon, respectively. Notably, no peaks attributable to crystalline metal nanoparticles were detected. Furthermore, the peak of the (002) plane of graphitic carbon in M-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NCs was slightly shifted to the right compared to that of NC, which indicated that the introduction of single-atom M-N
 <sub>4</sub> units increased the average size of defects in the carbon matrix. The Raman spectra of M-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NCs and NC (Fig. S4) featured two major characteristic peaks, viz. the D-band (1344 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) and the G-band (1587 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>), with the

 <sub>4</sub>/NC and Fe-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC determined to be 1.00 and 1.01, respectively. In contrast, a smaller value of 0.91 was obtained for NC. As the incorporation of single-atom M-N
 <sub>4</sub> units created larger defects within the NC matrix, it is reasonable that Co-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC and Fe-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC presented a higher

 <sub>4</sub>/NCs and NC (Fig. S5) could be classified as type IV, indicating a mesoporous structure. Moreover, the narrow hysteresis loop in the region of

 <sub>4</sub>/NC were estimated as 257.91 and 275.68 m

 <sub>4</sub>/NCs can dramatically diminish the proton spread path and accelerate ion diffusion between the electrode and the electrolyte [
