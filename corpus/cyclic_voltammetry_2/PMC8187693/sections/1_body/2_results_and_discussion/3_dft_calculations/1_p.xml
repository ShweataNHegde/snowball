<p id="Par47">DFT calculations were performed to obtain deeper insights into the free energy landscape of the ORR and OER. First, we have modeled NC structures with N-doped graphene-based supercells having low and high defect concentrations according to experimental observation of the various N-doped graphene structures. The relaxed atomic configurations of OER/ORR intermediate adsorbates on NC, Co-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC, and Fe-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC are illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a. The ORR/OER reaction steps (I–IV) corresponding to OOH, O, and OH adsorption and H
 <sub>2</sub>O generation are described as follows:
