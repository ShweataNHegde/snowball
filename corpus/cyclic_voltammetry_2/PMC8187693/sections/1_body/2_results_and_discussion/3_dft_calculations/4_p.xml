 <sub>4</sub> is calculated based on the highest energy barrier at the rate-determining step (RDS). In the case of Co-N

 <sub>4</sub>/NC, the RDS of OER belongs to step III (O

 <sub>OER</sub> of Co-N

 <sub>4</sub> calculated from DFT calculations is 0.19 and 0.82 V, respectively. Meanwhile, the corresponding

 <sub>ORR</sub> of Co-N
 <sub>4</sub> and Fe-N
 <sub>4</sub> is reported as 0.40 and 0.85 V. The trends of theoretically OER and ORR overpotential from DFT calculations are well consistent with experimental results, as both overpotentials of Co-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC obtained from electrochemical are lower than that of Fe-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC. The theoretical and experimental overpotentials are summarized in Table S5. The detailed pathways of reversible OER/ORR reactions promoted by M-N
 <sub>4</sub> active sites are summarized in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>c. Overall, both DFT calculations and electrochemical evaluations confirmed that single-atom Co-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC is the most promising bifunctional OER/ORR electrocatalyst.
