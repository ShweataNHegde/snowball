<p id="Par30">Among the screened metal phthalocyanines, M-N
 <sub>4</sub> structures featuring Fe and Co as central metal atoms exhibited the best ORR/OER catalytic activity in an alkaline electrolyte [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Wang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] applied iron phthalocyanine (Fe-Pc) as an analog to FeN
 <sub>4</sub> and explored the ORR activity by means of comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) computations. It was found that O
 <sub>2</sub> could readily bind to the Fe center with charge transfer from Fe to O
 <sub>2</sub>, and O
 <sub>2</sub>* reduction was identified as the rate-determining step. Moreover, Peng et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] indicated that the number of states around the Fermi level was significantly higher for the FeN
 <sub>4</sub> moiety with dominant contributions from the Fe 3d orbital based on DFT density of states plots. This indicates that the Fe center is favorable for the adsorption of O
 <sub>2</sub> and may donate electrons to reduce O
 <sub>2</sub>, which results in superior ORR catalytic activity. In contrast, the contribution of Co-N
 <sub>4</sub> seems to be more significant in OER process. Fei et al. investigated the MN
 <sub>4</sub>C
 <sub>4</sub> (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) moieties in a graphene matrix by DFT calculations and experimental studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In the theoretical calculations, the free energy of the rate-determining step (RDS) for Fe–NHGF is the oxidation of O* to OOH* with limiting barrier energy as large as 0.97 eV. In the case of Co–NHGF, the RDS is the oxidation of OH* to O* with much lower limiting barrier of 0.52 eV. The experimental results also agreed with the DFT calculation and supported the advanced OER catalytic activity in Co moieties.
