<p id="Par27">The growing demand for green and renewable energy has inspired the vigorous development of power conversion and storage devices (e.g., fuel cells as well as metal–air and secondary batteries) that reveal high power densities and are cheap, safe to handle, and eco-friendly [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Among the numerous energy conversion devices, rechargeable zinc–air batteries (ZABs) feature a decent theoretical density (1084 Wh kg
 <sup>−1</sup>) and high safety; thus, they are potentially suited for application in electric vehicles and portable electronic devices [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, the widespread commercialization of these batteries is hindered by their large overpotentials for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Given that noble-metal-based ORR/OER electrocatalysts (such as Pt and Ru/Ir) suffer from high cost and poor stability during repeated charge–discharge [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], it is essential to develop new bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts with high activity and cycling stability and containing earth-abundant elements as replacements of noble-metal-based catalysts in rechargeable ZABs [
