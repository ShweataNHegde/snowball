<p id="Par60">Ultrasonication-assisted plasma engineering was used to incorporate evenly dispersed single-atom M-N
 <sub>4</sub> (M = Fe, Co) sites into NC, achieving a production rate of ~ 10 mg/min. The results of physicochemical analysis supported the incorporation of planar M-N
 <sub>4</sub> structures into the NC matrix, revealing that these structures acted as the major ORR/OER active sites. In an alkaline medium, the single-atom M-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC (M = Fe, Co) electrocatalysts showed high ORR/OER performance and stability superior to those of benchmark Pt/C and Ru/C catalysts. Specifically, Co-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC showed a notable potential difference (Δ
 <italic>E</italic>) of 0.79 V, outperforming the benchmark Pt/C-Ru/C at the same loading (Δ
 <italic>E</italic> = 0.88 V). DFT calculations showed that the free energy landscape of Co-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC indicated better adsorption–desorption in reversible ORR/OER stages than that of Fe-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC, which well agreed with the experimental results. In a practical application, Co-N
 <sub>4</sub>/NC demonstrated electrocatalytic activity superior to that of Pt/C-Ru/C, achieving higher power density and durability in a rechargeable ZAB. Thus, herein we describe a promising, versatile, and scalable strategy of synthesizing various types of single-atom metal–carbon catalysts, an important class of frontier catalytic materials widely utilized in metal–air batteries and fuel cells.
