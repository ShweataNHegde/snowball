<p id="Par50">We make full use of the effective specific surface area of MOFs and high activity of CoP to produce excellent bifunctional electrocatalyst. The uniform introduction of cobalt sources on the surface of MOFs nanosheets by atomic layer deposition (ALD) techniques, and the derivation of N-doped nanotubes during high-temperature calcination, and encapsulation of Co/CoP in the tip of the nanotubes were reported. It is confirmed that the presence of nanotubes provides a larger specific surface area for the electrocatalyst. When used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst, NPMCNT-300 exhibits extraordinary electrochemical performance for both OER and ORR. It was demonstrating an onset-potential of 0.925 V for ORR and the overpotential is about 342 mV with a Tafel slope of 74 mV dec
 <sup>−1</sup> for OER. Moreover, the electrocatalyst displayed prominent stability for both OER and ORR.
