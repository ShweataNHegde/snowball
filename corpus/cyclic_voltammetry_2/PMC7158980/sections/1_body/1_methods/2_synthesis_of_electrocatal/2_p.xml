<p id="Par31">The electrocatalyst (denoted as NPMCNT) was deposited by using equipment of KEMICRO PEALD-200A (Kemin Co. Ltd, China). During the PE-ALD process, Cobaltocene (CoCp
 <sub>2</sub>) was used as Co source and oxygen plasma (O
 <sub>2</sub>, 99.999%) was used as O source. This sedimentary process was deposited at 200 °C in a vacuum reaction chamber and argon (Ar, 99.999%) as the carrier gas was used to purge excess sources. The Co source temperature was 100 °C. The second source (oxygen plasma) was maintained at 25 °C. The deposition process consists of 200 cycles and each cycle consists of 4 steps: Co source, Ar, oxygen plasma, and Ar. The dose times of Co source and oxygen plasma were 3 and 20 s respectively, and the Ar purge time was 50 s. The obtained powder was annealed at 925 °C for 2 h under N
 <sub>2</sub> with the heating rate of 2 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup>. The acquired product was named NPMCNT.
