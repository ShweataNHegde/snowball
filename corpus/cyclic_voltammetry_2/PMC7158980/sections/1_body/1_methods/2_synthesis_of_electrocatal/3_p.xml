<p id="Par32">The 10 mg NPMCNT electrocatalyst obtained above was placed upstream of the tube furnace, and 300 mg of sodium hypophosphite was placed downstream of the tube furnace, and then annealed at 350 °C for 2 h under N
 <sub>2</sub> with the heating rate of 2 °C min
 <sup>-1</sup>. The acquired product was named NPMCNT-300. The NPMCNT-50, NPMCNT-100, NPMCNT-200, and NPMCNT-400 were prepared using the same procedure but the sodium hypophosphite amount was changed as 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg, respectively.
