<p id="Par33">The crystallite structure was acquired by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, Empyrean, PANalytical) with Cu Kα radiation. The morphology was confirmed by the field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JSM-7800F). The microstructure was observed by transmission electron microscope (FETEM, JEM-200). The element distribution was measured by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, JEM-F200). The relationship of the bond energy was collected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, K-Alpha+). Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were collected on a BELSORP-max II instrument.</p>
