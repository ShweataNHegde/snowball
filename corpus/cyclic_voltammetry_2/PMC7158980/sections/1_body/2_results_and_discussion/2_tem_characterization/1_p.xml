<p id="Par41">TEM observation shows the entire view of the entire NPMCNT-300. Obviously, the bulk morphology of MOFs was preserved, and a large number of nanotubes were clearly visible at the edges, as well as the nanoparticles are encapsulated in the carbon nanotubes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). The high-resolution TEM in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b further proves the nanoparticles encapsulated at the tip of carbon nanotubes. Co nanoparticles will catalyze the derivation of CNTs from MOFs, which can improve the conductivity of the entire hybrid structure. And few layer of graphitic carbon layer can prevent the embedded Co and CoP nanoparticles from corrosion, aggregation, and oxidation during the electrocatalytic processes, which results in excellent durability and stability in harsh environments. In addition, the N-doped CNTs structure derived from MOFs provides an effective way to adjust the electronic structure of the electrocatalyst, thereby promoting catalytic performance. The plane spacing in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c is determined to be 0.244 and 0.231 nm, identifying with the (102) and (201) crystal plane of the CoP nanoparticles, respectively. The EDS analysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d) further confirmed that the nanoparticles were encapsulated at the tip of the CNTs, and the mapped image also shows that P was not only present in the CoP nanoparticles but also in the CNTs. The N-doped carbon-supported nanomaterials can be obtained from organic monomers (2-methylimidazole) by heat treatment without using any external source. For the phosphorus doping, the NaH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>2</sub> is as the phosphorus source and will dope into the carbon structure by heat treatment at 350 °C. In this work, doping of different heteroatoms can modify the chemical structure and electronic structure of the electrocatalyst, so that the surface of the derived nanotubes will have more catalytically active sites. Some reports indicated that carbon defects can generate active sites by adjusting the electronic structure and surface polarity of carbon, thereby improving the electrocatalytic performance. Therefore, carbon-based cobalt phosphide nanocomposites doped with multiple heteroatoms have more excellent electrocatalytic activity [
