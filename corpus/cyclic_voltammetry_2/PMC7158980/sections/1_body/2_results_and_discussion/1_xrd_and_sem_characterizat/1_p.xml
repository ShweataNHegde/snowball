<p id="Par40">In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, typical patterns of Co (PDF no.15-0806) and CoP (PDF no.29-0497) are shown in the XRD patterns of NPMCNT composites under different phosphorus source intakes. It is worth noting that the intake of different phosphorus sources during phosphating process will lead to the formation of different products. When the phosphorus source was 50, 100, and 200 mg, it was obvious that the characteristic peak of Co
 <sub>2</sub>P at 40.7° appeared. However, when the phosphorus source intake was increased to 300 and 400 mg, the characteristic peak of Co
 <sub>2</sub>P was disappeared. Therefore, the Co/CoP hybrid was obtained when using the latter mass of phosphorus source. The characteristic peaks displayed between 20° and 30° are due to the carbon clothes formed after MOFs calcination. It can be observed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b, NPM presents a hexagonal sheet structure after pyrolysis at high temperature and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> c shows that CNTs were generated evenly on the surface of NPM sheet. Herein, according to our previous work [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], CoOx was deposited by ALD on the surface of NPM at 200 °C, which is reduced to Co by carbon at 925 °C and nanotubes are grown. When the phosphorus source intake was 400 mg, the nanotubes were already bonded together instead of being individual distribution as shown in Fig.
