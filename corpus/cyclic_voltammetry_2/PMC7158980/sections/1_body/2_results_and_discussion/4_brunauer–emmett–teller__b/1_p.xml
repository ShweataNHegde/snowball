<p id="Par43">The nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms of NPMCNT-300 is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>f. It is worth mentioning that the isotherms show a type-IV hysteretic loop, which demonstrates the presence of numerous mesoporous/microporous in NPMCNT-300 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. And the BET surface area value of NPMCNT-300 electrocatalyst is 641 m
 <sup>2</sup> g
 <sup>âˆ’1</sup>, these consequences show that the presence of nanotubes during the synthesis of NPMCNT-300 can greatly increase the specific surface area and pore volume of the electrocatalyst. This unique porous structure with large specific surface area is thought to be important for oxygen absorption and transportation of reactant molecules and exposure of the most active substances.
