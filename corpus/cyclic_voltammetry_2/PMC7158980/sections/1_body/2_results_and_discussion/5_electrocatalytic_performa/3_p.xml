<p id="Par46">The above results summarize the corresponding OER and ORR electrochemical performances of different products, indicating that the intake of different phosphorus sources will affect the performance of the electrocatalysts. On one hand, although the electrocatalysts of NPMCNT-50, NPMCNT-100, and NPMCNT-200 have similar structures, the phosphorus content is lower which will cause the amount of CoP formation is less. On the other hand, although NPMCNT-400 contains the highest phosphorus content, due to the destruction of the original CNT structure, the CNTs clumped together and the electrocatalytic activity was relatively poor. The special morphology of NPMCNT-300 provides larger specific surface area as well as higher amount of CoP, resulting in improved electrochemical performance.</p>
