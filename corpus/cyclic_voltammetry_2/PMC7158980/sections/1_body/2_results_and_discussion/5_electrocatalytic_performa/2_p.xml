<p id="Par45">To assess the electrocatalytic performance for OER of the NPMCNT-300, the LSV curves were tested at the scanning rate of 5 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup>. In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a, NPMCNT-300 electrocatalyst exhibits overpotential of 342 mV, which is equivalent to the potential of RuO
 <sub>2</sub> electrocatalyst (340 mV). While for NPMCNT, NPMCNT-50, NPMCNT-100, NPMCNT-200, and NPMCNT-400 were 579, 488, 461, 418, and 430 mV, respectively. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> b shows that the Tafel slope of NPMCNT-300 electrocatalyst is 74 mV dec
 <sup>−1</sup> and for NPMCNT, NPMCNT-50, NPMCNT-100, NPMCNT-200, and NPMCNT-400 are 266, 170, 190, 137, 156 mV dec
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. While the NPMCNT-300 electrocatalyst is lower than RuO
 <sub>2</sub> (88 mV dec
 <sup>−1</sup>), therefore proving the excellent OER kinetics of NPMCNT-300 electrocatalyst. This results show that NPMCNT-300 has the excellent electrocatalytic performance as RuO
 <sub>2</sub> for OER. In order to investigate the durability of the NPMCNT-300 electrocatalyst, two methods were used. First, NPMCNT-300 was tested in a KOH electrolyte for 1000-cycle CV (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c). After the test, it showed a little reduction in degradation (5 mV). Another stability test was using the chronoamperometry method. The chronoamperometry method is to record the change of current with time by applying a large step potential (from a potential jump occurring in a Faraday reaction to an effective potential approaching zero of the surface electroactive component of the electrode) to the working electrode in the unstirred solution. The initial potential was based on the results from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d, which makes the NPMCNT-300 and RuO
 <sub>2</sub> to produced 10 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup> within iR compensation. The current of NPMCNT-300 electrocatalyst is retained for about 90% for 9 consecutive hours, while RuO
 <sub>2</sub> loses more than 50% of the current only in 1 h. Both stability tests indicate NPMCNT-300 has excellent stability for OER. Comparison of the electrocatalytic performance of CoP with various reported Co-based non-precious electrocatalysts in alkaline media in Table
