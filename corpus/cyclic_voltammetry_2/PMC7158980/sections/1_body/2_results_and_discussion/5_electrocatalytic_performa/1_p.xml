<p id="Par44">The electrocatalytic activity was tested using a three-electrode system for ORR. In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a, the LSV curves were examined in an O
 <sub>2</sub>-saturated electrolyte. The onset potentials of NPMCNT, NPMCNT-50, NPMCNT-100, NPMCNT-200, NPMCNT-300, and NPMCNT-400 are 0.80, 0.89, 0.91, 0.90, 0.93, and 0.89 V (vs. RHE), respectively. Clearly, NPMCNT-300 exhibits the highest electrocatalytic activity. Compared with 40% Pt/C (0.993 V vs. RHE ), the performance of former is slightly weaker, however, diffusion-limited current density for NPMCNT-300s is close to 6 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup>, which is better than Pt/C (5.1 mA cm
 <sup>−2</sup>). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> b shows typical LSV curves for NPMCNT-300 at different various rotational speeds (from 625 to 2025 rpm). The value of electron transfer number for ORR process of NPMCNT-300 is calculated to be close to 4 when the potential is from 0.35 to 0.65 V, which confirms the four-electron transfer pathway (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). To estimate the ORR kinetics, the number of electron transfer and yield of H

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d). The number of electron transfer (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e) of the NPMCNT-300 was about 3.7, which is agree well with the reckoned data from K–L equation, indicating that the ORR process follows an efficient four-electron approach. In the presence of these electrocatalysts, the intermediate H

 <sub>2</sub> formation rate is low, which is about 17%. In order to measure the stability of the electrocatalyst, we used the i-t method to characterize the electrocatalyst at a voltage of 0.5 V and the rotation speed of 1600 rpm in O
 <sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> f shows the relative current density. After 40,000 s of continuous operation, NPMCNT-300 maintains a high relative current density of 94%, whereas, the initial current density was retained only 91% for Pt/C after continuous operation for 10,000 s, which indicates that the stability of NPMCNT-300 electrocatalyst is superior to the 40% Pt/C electrode.
