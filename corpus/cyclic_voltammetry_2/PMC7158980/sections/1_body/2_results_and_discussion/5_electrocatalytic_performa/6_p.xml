 <italic>C</italic>s is the specific capacitance of the sample or the capacitance of an atomically smooth planar surface of the material per unit area under identical electrolyte conditions. By considering the specific capacitance of an atomically smooth planar surface with a real surface area of 1.0 cm
 <sup>2</sup>, the specific capacitance (

 <sup>−2</sup> in alkaline media. For our estimates of surface area, we use general specific capacitances of Cs = 0.04 mF cm
 <sup>−2</sup> in 0.1 M KOH. From this, we estimate that the ECSA are 0.0689, 0.1089, 0.1275, 0.1294, and 0.1093 m
 <sup>2</sup> for NPMCNT-50, NPMCNT-100, NPMCNT-200, NPMCNT-300, and NPMCNT-400 electrocatalysts. Therefore, the NPMCNT-300 electrocatalyst exhibits excellent performance for OER and ORR.
