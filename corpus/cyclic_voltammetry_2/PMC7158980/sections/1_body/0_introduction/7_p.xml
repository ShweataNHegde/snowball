<p id="Par28">Herein, we report the preparation of nanotubes (CNTs) derived from N-doped porous MOFs nanosheets (NPM) via atomic layer deposition (ALD) techniques, with Co/CoP nanoparticles encapsulated at the tip of the nanotubes. The controlled portion of the Co-MOFs creates a Co/CoP species during the phosphating process, resulting in a hybrid nanostructure that have a large specific surface area. The as-prepared product is used as electrocatalyst, exhibiting a bifunctional feature in electrochemical performance for both OER and ORR. Its onset potential was 0.93 V for ORR while the overpotential was about 342 mV with the Tafel slope of 74 mV dec
 <sup>−1</sup> for OER. Moreover, the electrocatalyst also showed excellent stability for both reactions.
