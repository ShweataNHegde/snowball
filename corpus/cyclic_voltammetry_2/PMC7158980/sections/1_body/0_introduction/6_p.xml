<p id="Par27">Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a series of adjustable organic-inorganic hybrid materials with adjustable structures [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In short, metal ions are uniformly dispersed at the atomic level in the MOFs precursor, and the presence of organic ligands in the MOFs enables them to be calcined into various carbon materials without introducing an external carbon source [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. As a general precursor for the preparation of TMPs, MOFs compounds have been extensively studied by reason of their large specific surface area, high porosity, and structural coordination [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In general, MOFs carbonization process requires high temperature calcination, which will damage the original MOFs structure and cause agglomeration of the metal center [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Direct use of MOFs as an electrocatalyst can utilize its good structure, but their stability is relatively low, and catalytic activity is poor, especially under strong alkaline and acidic solution conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. If reasonably designed, the hybrid electrocatalyst combining TMPs and MOFs not only enhances the intrinsic catalytic activity but also utilizes the well-defined porous structure of MOFs. More importantly, the center of the coordinated unsaturated metal MOFs is more favorable for adsorption oxygen-containing substances, which will further enhance catalytic performance [
