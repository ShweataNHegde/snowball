Therefore, a need exists to develop cost-effective and highly active alternative electrocatalysts for ORR and OER. This study investigates the influence of metal coordination fashion on electrocatalytic ORR and OER activities among three types of Co-Mn bimetallic oxides (CMOs): tunnel-type (CMO_T), layer-type (CMO_L), and spinel-type (CMO_S) structures. An electrochemical evaluation for CMOs verifies that CMO_L has the highest ORR and OER specific activities, which is relatively better than the previously reported bifunctional metal oxides. Additionally, atomic configuration analysis for the oxides suggests that the excellent ORR and OER activities of CMO_L result from the difference in Co and Mn coordination states.
