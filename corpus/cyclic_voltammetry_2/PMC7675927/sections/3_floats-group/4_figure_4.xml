  <p>OER performances of CMOs. (a,b) Polarization curves at an electrode rotating rate of 1600 rpm in O
   <sub>2</sub>-saturated 1 M KOH. (c) Complemental Tafel plots extracted from the polarization curves in (b). (d) OER mass activities of the three types of oxides at 1.65 V, which were obtained by normalizing the current densities of polarization curves in (a) using loading metal amounts on the RDE. (e) OER specific activities of the three types of the oxides at 1.65 V, which were obtained by normalizing the current densities of polarization curves in (a) using BET specific surface areas of the oxides on the RDE.
