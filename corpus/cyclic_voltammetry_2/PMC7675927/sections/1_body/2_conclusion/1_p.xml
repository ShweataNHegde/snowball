<p>The influence of metal coordination fashion on ORR and OER electrocatalytic activities in alkaline media was investigated by evaluating the activities of three types of Co–Mn bimetallic oxides (CMOs): tunnel-type (CMO_T), layer-type (CMO_L), and spinel-type (CMO_S) structures. Of these, CMO_L exhibited the highest ORR and OER activities. The ORR specific activity of CMO_L was found to be 4.4 and 5.6 times larger than those of CMO_T and S, respectively. Additionally, the OER specific activity was 7.8 and 26 times larger than those of CMO_T and S, respectively. Furthermore, the OER performance of CMO_L showed sufficient durability in alkaline media during a potential cycle test. The ORR and OER specific activities of CMO_L surpassed any previously reported bifunctional metal oxides bearing two 3d transition metals that can catalyze ORR and OER. Furthermore, EXAFS analysis indicated that the excellent ORR and OER activities of CMO_L resulted from the difference in Co coordination states among the three types of structures. Therefore, this study has demonstrated the influence of metal coordination fashion on ORR and OER electroactivities; i.e., a layer structure highly merits ORR and OER processes. These findings not only highlight an excellent electrocatalyst for alkaline fuel cells, water electrolyzers, and metal–air batteries but also provide a novel guideline for an efficient structural design of oxygen electrocatalysts. Further elucidations by computational calculations to obtain more insights into the catalytic mechanism on each structural difference are currently being conceived in our laboratories.</p>
