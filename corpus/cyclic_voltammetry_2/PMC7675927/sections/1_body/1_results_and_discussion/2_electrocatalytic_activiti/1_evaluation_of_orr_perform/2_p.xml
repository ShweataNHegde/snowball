<p>The durability of catalytic performance is an important factor for practical applications. The electrochemical stability of CMO_L was then tested by potential cycling (load cycle) between 0.6 and 1.0 V in N
 <sub>2</sub>-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. Aged CMO_L showed a negative potential shift for the ORR current, as shown in

This deterioration is attributable to the repeated redox reaction on the CMO_L surface.

CMO_L initially exhibited oxidation and reduction peaks at 0.8 and 0.5 V, respectively, which can correspond to the overlapping of several redox processes involving Co and Mn species.

 </sup> However, the peak currents decreased as the number of cycles increased, and finally, they disappeared. This indicated an irreversible redox process on the CMO_L surface when applying a potential. Consequently, CMO_L transformed and/or degraded, resulting in the deterioration of CMO_L.
