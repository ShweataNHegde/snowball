 <italic>iR</italic>-corrected OER polarization curves with OER current density per electrode disk area and per BET specific surface area of CMOs, respectively, which display the mean of the forward and backward CV cycles. The polarization curves were used to determine the OER overpotentials of each oxide, which are defined as the potential gap between the theoretical potential of OER (1.23 V vs. RHE) and the experimentally measured potential at a current density of 10 mA cm

 </xref>c shows Tafel slopes, which were also extracted from the polarization curves. The Tafel slopes show trends similar to the overpotentials; i.e., the Tafel slopes of CMO_T and L were smaller than that of CMO_S, indicating advantageous OER kinetics in CMO_T and L. Similar to the evaluation of ORR performance, the OER mass and specific activities at 1.65 V are displayed in

 </xref>d and e, respectively. The trends of OER activity resembled those of ORR activity. CMO_L demonstrated the highest OER mass and OER specific activities when compared to CMO_T and S. The specific activity of CMO_L was 7.8 and 26 times larger than those of the CMO_T and S, respectively. Furthermore, similar to ORR, the OER specific activity of CMO_L was significantly better than those of the previously reported nonprecious bimetallic oxides, as summarized in

Although good wettability of the catalyst surface can facilitate the release of evolved O
 <sub>2</sub> bubbles from the catalyst surfaces and is beneficial for the OER process, the dramatic improvement of OER activity of CMO_L cannot be explained by the surface wettability of catalyst particles. Therefore, ORR and OER electrocatalysis is significantly affected by the structural differences of electrocatalysts; i.e., a layer structure extensively facilitates this electrocatalysis.
