<p>Furthermore, the long-term durability of the OER performance of CMO_L was examined through repeated potential cycles for OER measurements in 1 M KOH. OER polarization curves at the initial and 500th cycles are shown in

 </xref>, demonstrating that OER current at a lower potential near the onset potential was retained after 500 cycles, which indicated that the intrinsic activity of CMO_L did not deteriorate. In contrast, the OER current at a higher potential was slightly diminished due to the partial corrosion of a conductive CNT support, which led to the limitation of electron transfer in the catalyst layer. Therefore, the durability test showed that CMO_L exhibits a high durability during the OER process in alkaline media and is a highly promising OER electrocatalyst for practical applications.
