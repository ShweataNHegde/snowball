<p>CMOs were prepared through a reduction of permanganate (MnO
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>–</sup>) in a cobalt chloride (CoCl
 <sub>2</sub>) solution in 2-propanol. Their structures were successfully regulated by adding water to the reaction solution for controlling Co
 <sup>2+</sup> coordination by hydration. The high-energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of CMO_T, L, and S are shown in

 </xref>a. In CMO_L, peaks are attributable to two types of layered structures; peaks at 4.61, 9.19, 13.77, 18.24, 31.79, and 36.88° (the interplanar spacing of 
 <italic>d</italic> = 0.96, 0.48, 0.32, 0.24, 0.14, and 0.12 nm, respectively) are attributed to the buserite-type structure with an interlayer distance of 0.96 nm, while peaks at 6.27 and 12.71° (
 <italic>d</italic> = 0.71 and 0.32 nm, respectively) are attributed to the birnnesite-type structure with the interlayer distance of 0.71 nm, which formed by dehydration of the buserite-type structure during the drying process.

 </sup> In CMO_T, peaks at 4.61, 9.19, 18.24, 31.79, and 36.88° (
 <italic>d</italic> = 0.96, 0.48, 0.24, 0.14, and 0.12 nm, respectively) are observed. These peak positions are the same as those for the buserite-type structure, but no other peaks are observed, indicating that no structure change in CMO_T occurs during the drying process compared to CMO_L. Therefore, the strucutre of CMO_T is attributable to the 3 × 3 tunnel todorokite-type (OMS-1) since it has a rigid structure against dehydration.

 </sup> In CMO_S, peaks at 9.19, 18.24, 31.79, and 36.88° (
 <italic>d</italic> = 0.48, 0.24, 0.14, and 0.12 nm, respectively) are observed. The absence of the lower angle peak at 4.61° (
 <italic>d</italic> = 0.96 nm) suggests the different structure from either CMO_T or CMO_L, and possibly, it is attributed to the cubic spinel-type structure.

 </sup> Note that manganese spinels (e.g., hausmannite) usually have the tetragonal structure due to Jahn–Teller distortion of Mn
 <sup>3+</sup> ions. However, in CMO_S, the Co/Mn molar ratio is lower than 0.5 as shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref>
 </xref>, and the valence state of Mn is higher than trivalent from Mn K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra (

In addition, the Mn K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectrum shows a single peak at 2–3 Å derived from single Mn–metal paths, suggesting that no Jahn–Teller distortion occurred in CMO_S, as shown later.

 </sup> According to the above, Mn
 <sup>4+</sup> partially exists in CMO_S to form nonstoichiometric cubic spinel Co
