 </xref>. A lattice fringe derived from the buserite-type structure with a 
 <italic>d</italic>-spacing of 0.96 nm was not observed, probably because the buserite-type structure was transformed to the birnnesite-type structure during the vacuum drying pretreatment for the TEM measurement. Additionally, CMO_T showed a bundle structure that had a 
 <italic>d</italic>-spacing of 0.50 nm, which corresponds to half the distance in the Mn oxide tunnel framework; its rigid structure is maintained during the vacuum drying pretreatment, as described above. In contrast, CMO_S displayed lattice fringes with 
 <italic>d</italic>-spacings of 0.47 and 0.26 nm, which can be assigned to the (111) and (311) lattice planes of the cubic spinel structure, respectively. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in

The particle diameters of the three types of oxides are summarized in
