<p>As alternative oxygen electrocatalysts, 3d transition metal-based electrocatalysts have recently drawn much interest because of their abundance and cost-effectiveness and have been explored among various classes of substances,

 </sup> Because of their outstanding properties, such as facile synthesis, low toxicity, and high electrochemical activities, multimetal oxides have been considered as attractive candidates for oxygen electrocatalysts. For instance, spinel and perovskite-type oxides are well-known to exhibit excellent ORR and OER activities owing to the combination of metal elements, compared to single-metal oxides.
 <sup>

 </sup> Several previous studies have demonstrated that elemental compositions can significantly affect ORR and OER activities.

 </sup> The elemental effects on these activities have been primarily discussed through computational calculations, and these activities are considered to be relevant to many descriptors, including the

 </sup> For example, our group recently found out that orthorhombic calcium iron oxide (CaFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>) possesses excellent OER activity in alkaline media and that its OER specific activity is significantly higher than that of previously reported alkaline-earth or rare-earth metal-containing Fe-based oxides. Computational calculation of the geometrical structures of the compounds has suggested that the excellent OER activity of CaFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> is attributable to the edge-shared FeO6 polyhedral connectivity. Kakizaki et al.
