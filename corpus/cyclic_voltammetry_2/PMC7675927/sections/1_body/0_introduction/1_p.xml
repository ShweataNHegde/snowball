<p>The energy and environmental challenges, including depletion of fossil fuels and emission of greenhouse gases, have created a need to develop alternative clean energy sources and efficient energy conversion systems. The power-to-gas approach, which converts electricity from renewable energy resources into portable and high-energy density chemical fuels, is regarded as a promising process. Therefore, practical and emission-free energy conversion and storage devices are highly desired. These include fuel cells, water electrolyzers, and metal–air batteries, which are expected to be crucial in creating a sustainable society in the future. For example, polymer electrolyte fuel cells and water electrolyzers use solid proton-exchange membranes such as Nafion to achieve high current densities. However, because of their acidic conditions, electrocatalysts in these devices are limited to noble metals only, such as platinum, ruthenium, and iridium-based compounds,

 </sup> and their expensiveness prevents the widespread use. In contrast, anion-exchange membrane (AEM) systems have attracted extensive attention over the last decade because their alkaline environment allows the use of nonprecious metal-based electrocatalysts.

 </sup> Membrane stability was a challenge when using AEM systems. Therefore, intensive research efforts have recently made significant breakthroughs in membrane durability for operating conditions.

 </sup> This has opened an avenue for the commercialization of AEM systems. Contrarily, regarding electrocatalysis in the AEM systems, the two types of oxygen electrocatalytic reactions, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR: O

 <sup>–</sup>) in water electrolyzers and metal–air batteries induce a large overpotential and cause insufficient power densities, which is one of the main concerns for practical applications. Therefore, cost-friendly electrocatalysts that possess prominent ORR and OER activities are highly desirable.
