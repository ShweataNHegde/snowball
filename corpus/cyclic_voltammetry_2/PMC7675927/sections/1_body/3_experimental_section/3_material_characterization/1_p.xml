<p>Synchrotron powder XRD patterns with a wavelength of λ = 0.775 Å were collected at the BL5S2 beamline of the Aichi Synchrotron Radiation Center. Samples were charged into Lindeman glass capillaries of 0.5 mm diameter and measured with a rotating stage and a PILATUS 100K detector. Co and Mn K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy was carried out using the transmission method at the BL11S2 beamline of the Aichi Synchrotron Radiation Center. The XANES and EXAFS were analyzed using the Athena and Artemis programs.

 </sup> For the EXAFS analysis, the 
 <italic>k</italic>-range of FT was 3–14 Å
 <sup>–1</sup>, with a Hanning window of 1 Å
 <sup>–1</sup>, and the radial distance range of the inverse FT was 1–3 Å. Elemental analyses were performed using ICP-AES on an Optima 3300XL (PerkinElmer, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). BET surface areas of CMOs were measured by N
 <sub>2</sub> adsorption at 77 K using a BELSORP18 (MicrotracBEL Corp., Osaka, Japan). The masses of samples for the measurements were approximately 0.1 g. Samples were dried at 120 °C under vacuum overnight and measured without exposure to air to prevent moisture absorption. SEM images were obtained on a Hitachi S-5500 (Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 5.0 kV. TEM images were obtained on a Hitachi H-9500 (Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.
