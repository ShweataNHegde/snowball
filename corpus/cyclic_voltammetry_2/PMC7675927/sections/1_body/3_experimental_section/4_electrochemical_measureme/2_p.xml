Hg/HgO (1 M KOH) and Pt were used as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The glass electrolysis cell includes a gas inlet, and electrolytes were saturated by N

 <sub>2</sub> (1 h) bubbling prior to measurements. The potential was converted to RHE. The calibration of Hg/HgO was conducted using Li et al.’s method.

 </sup> For calibration, electrolyte solutions (i.e., 0.1 and 1 M KOH) were saturated with pure hydrogen by bubbling for 60 min. Hg/HgO and Pt were used as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. A Pt disk was used as the working electrode. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were recorded at a scan rate of 1 mV s
 <sup>–1</sup>. The recorded LSV curves are shown in
