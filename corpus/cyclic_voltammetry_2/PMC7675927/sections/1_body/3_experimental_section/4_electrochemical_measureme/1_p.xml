<p>Electrocatalytic performances of the synthesized catalysts were evaluated using an HZ-7000 potentiostat (HOKUTO DENKO Corp., Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an electrode rotator (HR-301, HOKUTO DENKO Corp.) and a rotating-disk electrode (RDE, 5 mm diameter) formed of glassy carbon (disk area = 0.196 cm
 <sup>2</sup>). The working electrodes were prepared through the following procedures. A mixture of 1.0 mg of an oxide catalyst, 9.0 mg of the functionalized CNT, 0.12 mL of 3.3 wt % K
 <sup>+</sup> ion-exchanged Nafion, 0.42 mL of IPA, and 1.46 mL of water was homogenized for 3 min in an ice bath and diluted using the same solvent mixture with Nafion to adjust the catalyst concentration followed by sonicating for 2 h to prepare catalyst slurry. The CNT was selected as conductive carbon to mix with low-conductive oxide catalysts because of its relatively high corrosion resistance. Then, 7 μL of the resulting slurry was dropped onto an RDE and dried by rotation with 600 rpm in air. The loading amount of the oxide catalysts was set to 0.63 cm

The Pt/C catalyst slurry was also prepared by sonicating a mixture of Pt/C (10 mg), 5 wt % Nafion (0.2 mL), and ethanol (2.0 mL) for 3 h, and 4.2 μL of the resulting slurry was dropped onto the glassy carbon disk electrode and dried by rotation with 600 rpm in air.
