 </sup> Briefly, pristine CNT powder was treated with mixed acid solution containing 95% H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> and 60% HNO
 <sub>3</sub> with a volume ratio of 1:1 in a microwave reactor (Î¼Reactor EX, Shikoku Instrumentation Co., Ltd., Nakatado, Japan) for 15 min with 500 W. A 5 wt % Nafion solution (product number: 274704) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Japan K.K. (Tokyo, Japan), and its cation was exchanged by the addition of 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution. Carbon-supported platinum (Pt/C, 9.8% Pt, product number: 10E10E) and iridium oxide (IrO
 <sub>2</sub>, 75% Ir, product number: ELC-0110) were purchased from Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo (Tokyo, Japan). All other chemicals were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries and used as received.
