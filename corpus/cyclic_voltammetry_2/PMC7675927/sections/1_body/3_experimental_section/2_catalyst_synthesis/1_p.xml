 </sup> Precursor tetra-
 <italic>n</italic>-butylammonium permanganate (
 <italic>n</italic>-Bu
 <sub>4</sub>NMnO
 <sub>4</sub>) was synthesized by slowly adding an aqueous 
 <italic>n</italic>-Bu
 <sub>4</sub>NBr solution to an aqueous KMnO
 <sub>4</sub> solution under vigorous stirring. This was followed by stirring for 1 h. CMO_T and L: 
 <italic>n</italic>-Bu
 <sub>4</sub>NMnO
 <sub>4</sub> (2 mmol) powder was slowly added to a CoCl
 <sub>2</sub> (2 mmol) solution in a mixture of 2-propanol (50 mL) and water to obtain a molar ratio of H
 <sub>2</sub>O/CoCl
 <sub>2</sub> = 600 and 60, respectively. The solution was refluxed for 3 h. CMO_S: 
 <italic>n</italic>-Bu
 <sub>4</sub>NMnO
 <sub>4</sub> (2 mmol) powder was slowly added to an anhydrous CoCl
 <sub>2</sub> (2 mmol) solution in 2-propanol (50 mL) to form a colloidal solution. The solution was stirred for 30 min at room temperature followed by the addition of deionized water to form precipitates. Previous work reveals that the amount of H
 <sub>2</sub>O affects the structure of the binary oxide,

 </sup> while the excess amount of CoCl
 <sub>2</sub> does not affect the characteristics. These precipitates were collected by membrane filtration, washed with water and ethanol, and dried at 120 °C. Caution: 
 <italic>n</italic>-Bu
 <sub>4</sub>NMnO
 <sub>4</sub> can react violently with itself (the MnO
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>–</sup> anion can oxidize the 
 <italic>n</italic>-Bu
 <sub>4</sub>N cation) and possibly catch fire; hence, it should be handled with appropriate care and stored under appropriate conditions (e.g
 <italic>.</italic>, refrigerated conditions).
