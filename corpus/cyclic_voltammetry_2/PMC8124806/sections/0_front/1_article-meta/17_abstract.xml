 <p>Metal–ligand interactions in monomeric and polymeric transition metal complexes of Schiff base ligands largely define their functional properties and perspective applications. In this study, redox behavior of a nickel(II) N
  <sub>4</sub>-anilinosalen complex, [NiAmben] (where H
  <sub>2</sub>Amben = N,N′-bis(
  <italic>o</italic>-aminobenzylidene)ethylenediamine) was studied by cyclic voltammetry in solvents of different Lewis basicity. A poly-[NiAmben] film electrochemically synthesized from a 1,2-dichloroethane-based electrolyte was investigated by a combination of cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance, in situ UV-Vis spectroelectrochemistry, and in situ conductance measurements between −0.9 and 1.3 V vs. Ag/Ag
  <sup>+</sup>. The polymer displayed multistep redox processes involving reversible transfer of the total of ca. 1.6 electrons per repeat unit, electrical conductivity over a wide potential range, and multiple color changes in correlation with electrochemical processes. Performance advantages of poly-[NiAmben] over its nickel(II) N
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub> Schiff base analogue were identified and related to the increased number of accessible redox states in the polymer due to the higher extent of electronic communication between metal ions and ligand segments in the nickel(II) N
  <sub>4</sub>-anilinosalen system. The obtained results suggest that electrosynthesized poly-[NiAmben] films may be viable candidates for energy storage and saving applications.
