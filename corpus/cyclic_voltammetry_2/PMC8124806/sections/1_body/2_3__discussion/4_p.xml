<p>As follows from 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="molecules-26-02646-sch001">Scheme 1</xref>, poly-[NiAmben] contains 4,4′-diaminobiphenyl (benzidine) moieties, which are structurally similar to redox-active 4,4′-biphenolate segments in poly-[NiSalen] [

The potential-induced changes in the spectra of poly-[NiSalen] in a DCE-based electrolyte observed at potentials below 0.9 V are consistent with the formation of bisphenolic radical cations (according to EQCM studies, this potential range corresponds to the transfer of one electron per monomer unit), and those at more anodic potentials indicate the conversion of radical cations to bisphenolic dications (
