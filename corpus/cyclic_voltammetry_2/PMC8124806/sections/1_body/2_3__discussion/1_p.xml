<p>The obtained experimental data on the redox processes in [NiAmben] and poly-[NiAmben] films show that they are majorly defined by the specifics of metal–ligand interactions in nickel(II)–N
 <sub>4</sub> fragments and can be better understood through a comparison with the thoroughly investigated N
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> analogue.
