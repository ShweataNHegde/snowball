<p>Due to improved charge mobility in high oxidation states, poly-[NiAmben] can be reversibly and stably oxidized by the total of ca. 1.6 electrons per repeat unit and deliver high specific capacity of 136 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>, which represents its distinct advantage over the N
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> analogue. In addition to that, the increased number of available stable redox states in the polymer provides larger variety of reversible color changes in 
 <italic>p</italic>-doped poly-[NiAmben] as compared with poly-[NiSalen] (

Our study thus confirms that tuning metal–ligand interaction through controlled modification of the metal coordination sphere is a powerful strategy for the preparation of metallopolymers that realize improved potential-controlled optical and charge storage properties simultaneously. Such materials could be especially useful for fabricating multifunctional devices that can transform the sustainable energy sector.
