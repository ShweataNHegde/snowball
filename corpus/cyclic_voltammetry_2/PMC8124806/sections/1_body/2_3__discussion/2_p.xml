 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02646-f011">Figure 11</xref>a shows that the onset for the monomer oxidation in a DCE-based electrolyte is significantly cathodically shifted (by ca. 500 mV) in [NiAmben] vs. [NiSalen]. Easier oxidation of the N
 <sub>4</sub> complex likely results from higher radical delocalization over ligand scaffold in Ni
