<p>The observed conductivity behavior of poly-[NiAmben] substantially differs from that of conjugated organic polymers, which are usually characterized by a sigmoidal shape conductance profile and conductivity plateau over broad doping potential ranges when polaronic and bipolaronic states co-exist in the

 <xref rid="B35-molecules-26-02646" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The bell-shaped conductivity indicates that poly-[NiAmben] rather behaves like a redox polymer [

 <xref rid="B40-molecules-26-02646" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. According to the mixed-valence model, the maximum in the bell-shaped conductance profile is reached when half the sites of the redox state are charged [
