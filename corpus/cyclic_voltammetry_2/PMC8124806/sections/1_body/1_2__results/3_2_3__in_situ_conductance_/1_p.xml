<p>In situ conductance measurements were performed on poly-[NiAmben] in order to gain more insight into its electrochemical behavior and related charge transfer phenomena. Reliable values of conductivity cannot be calculated from the experimental data because of inhomogeneity of the polymer film and challenges in the determination of its thickness but the conductivity behavior of the polymer can be indirectly evaluated using its conductance

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02646-f008">Figure 8</xref>. The conduction onset at âˆ’0.34 V coincides with the onset for oxidation current. The conductance profile shows a bell-shape with two maxima at 0.04 V and 0.3 V. After dropping to zero at 0.65 V, the polymer conductance immediately starts increasing again but remains nearly an order of magnitude lower than the peak values attained for the less heavily doped film.
