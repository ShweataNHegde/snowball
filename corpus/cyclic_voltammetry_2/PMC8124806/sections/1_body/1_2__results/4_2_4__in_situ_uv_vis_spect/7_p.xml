<p>Further oxidation of the poly-[NiAmben] film at 0.9 V and 1.0 V (see also 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-02646">Figure S6e</xref>) brings up a slight increase in the absorbance at ca. 600 nm and 790 nm while intensities of the band at 380 nm and NIR absorption decrease simultaneously. Two new isosbestic points at 409 nm and 940 nm indicate that the polymer is converted to a heavily doped state. The spectra recorded above 1.0 V do not evolve much, except for a decrease in absorbance at wavelengths &gt;750 nm and a slight increase in the absorption intensity of the band at 600 nm. The observed multistep spectral changes are fully reversible once the electrode potential is reversed.
