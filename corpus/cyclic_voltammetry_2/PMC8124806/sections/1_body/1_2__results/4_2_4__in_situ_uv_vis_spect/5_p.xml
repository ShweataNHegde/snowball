<p>With further oxidation above 0 V (see also 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-02646">Figure S6c</xref>), a new band at 590 nm appears in the spectrum and starts increasing in intensity while simultaneously undergoing a blue shift (to 550 nm at 0.3 V) and overlapping with the deteriorating MLCT band. The transitions at 330 nm and 360 nm are further depleted. The absorption intensity of the latter band reaches the local minimum at 0.3 V. The absorbance above 900 nm increases. Although the spectral changes are indicative of the continuing oxidation of monomer units, the isosbestic point cannot be clearly identified from the obtained data, suggesting that several electrochemically different chromophores co-exist in the poly-[NiAmben] film in this range of potentials [
