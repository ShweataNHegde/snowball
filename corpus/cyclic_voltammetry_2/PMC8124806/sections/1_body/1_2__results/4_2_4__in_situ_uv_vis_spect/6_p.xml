<p>The changes in the spectra of poly-[NiAmben] in the range of electrode potentials from 0.4 to 0.8 V (see also 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-02646">Figure S6d</xref>) are distinctly different from the ones observed at lower anodic potentials. As the absorption band at 330 nm decreases in intensity, the band at 550 nm continues to increase, while NIR absorption remains virtually unchanged. These spectral changes are accompanied by the appearance of new bands at 380 nm, 430 nm, and 690 nm. An additional band is formed at 790 nm at potentials â‰¥ 0.6 V. The broad bands at 550 nm, 690 nm, and 790 nm largely overlap and increase in intensity as the polymer doping level increases. Only one clear isosbestic point at 347 nm is evident. The absorption band at 330 nm reaches minimum intensity by 0.8 V, indicating that all neutral segments of the metallopolymer have been oxidized.
