<p>Electrochemical oxidation of poly-[NiAmben] from âˆ’0.9 V (undoped film) to 1.3 V (heavily 
 <italic>p</italic>-doped film) was closely monitored by in situ UV-Vis spectroscopy to probe different redox states of the polymer and unveil spectral variations with potential indicative of electrochromic properties of the material.
