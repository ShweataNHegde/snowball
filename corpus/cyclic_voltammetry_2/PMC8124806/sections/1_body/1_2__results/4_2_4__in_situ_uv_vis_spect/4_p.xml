<p>Electrochemical studies in the range from −0.9 to 1.3 V show that the oxidation of poly-[NiAmben] does not actually begin until the electrode potentials is increased above ca. −0.6 V (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-02646">Figure S3</xref>). As seen from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02646-f009">Figure 9</xref>b, the π–π* transition of the neutral film at 305 nm is gradually depleted upon polymer oxidation at potentials above −0.6 V. The development of other absorption bands is non-monotonic. Spectral changes below −0.4 V (see also 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-02646">Figure S6a</xref>) are minor: the peaks at 330 nm, 360 nm, and 550 nm decrease in intensity while the absorbance between 400 and 500 nm increases in intensity. There is also a slight increase in the absorbance at &gt; 600 nm. These spectral changes accompanied with three isosbestic points at 400 nm, 501 nm, and 592 nm suggest the beginning of conversion between neutral and oxidized moieties of the polymer film. This initial oxidation does not appear to produce any significant number of mobile charges. As the poly-[NiAmben] film is oxidized above −0.4 V (see also 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-02646">Figure S6b</xref>), the MLCT band continues decreasing in intensity while undergoing a blue shift. This may be indicative of an increase in the effective oxidation state of the metal due to either metal oxidation [

 <xref rid="B43-molecules-26-02646" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The bands at 330 nm and 360 nm become further depleted. A new broad absorption band in the NIR range of wavelengths appears in the spectrum (the exact position of the peak cannot be determined because of the spectrophotometer limitations but the increase in absorbance above 900 nm testifies to its existence). Clear isosbestic points at 402 nm, 472 nm, and 576 nm suggest that the polymer conversion from the neutral to the oxidized state continues. Significant increase in the NIR absorption is indicative of efficient charge delocalization.
