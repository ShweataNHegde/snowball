<p>The changes in poly-[NiAmben] spectra accompanying the electrochemical switching of the polymer film between different oxidations states are reflected in visible color changes: the polymer is transformed from the ocher neutral form to the deep blue oxidized form through intermediate redox states displaying yellowish and green colors (
