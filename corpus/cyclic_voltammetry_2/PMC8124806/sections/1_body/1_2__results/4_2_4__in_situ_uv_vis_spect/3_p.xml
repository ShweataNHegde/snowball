<p>As the poly-[NiAmben] film is oxidized, the absorption bands of the neutral polymer decrease in intensity while several new bands are formed. Potential-induced spectral changes are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02646-f009">Figure 9</xref>b, which shows differential spectra of the polymer at step-wise increased potentials referenced to the spectrum of the undoped film (the acquired spectra are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-02646">Figure S5</xref>).
