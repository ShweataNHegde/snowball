<p>The spectrum of the undoped poly-[NiAmben] film (collected at −0.9 V) is quite similar to that of [NiAmben] monomer (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02646-f009">Figure 9</xref>a). In the monomeric complex, the band at 322 nm can be assigned to the intraligand π–π* transition involving the amidobenzilideneimino moieties, the band at 353 nm originates from the CT transition involving delocalized π-orbitals with substantial metal character, and the broad absorption band between 400 and 660 nm with a maximum at 474 nm can be assigned to the nickel-to-amidobenzilideneimino CT transitions involving a metal dz
 <sup>2</sup> orbital [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-02646" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Due to the similarity between the polymer and monomer spectra, the same assignment could be made for the bands of poly-[NiAmben] with absorption maxima at 305 nm, 365 nm, and broad absorption centered around ca. 500–550 nm, respectively.
