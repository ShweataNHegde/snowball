<p>The first oxidation wave with a peak potential at 0.21 V assigned to the formation of Ni
 <sup>II</sup>â€“anilinyl radical cation species is accompanied by a sharp increase in the electrode mass, which is however delayed in terms of potential by ca. 230 mV relative to the oxidation onset. The initial fast gain in the electrode mass continues up to ca. 0.3 V and slows down at more anodic potentials. The first oxidation of [NiAmben] is chemically reversible (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02646-f004">Figure 4</xref>b), so the initial sharp increase in the electrode mass can be attributed to the deposition of polymerization intermediates that can be reversibly reduced if the electrode potential is reversed right after the first oxidation peak (as in the case shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02646-f004">Figure 4</xref>b). If the forward scan is extended beyond the potentials of the first redox process, these adsorbed intermediates undergo further oxidation and continue to react with oxidizing solution species giving rise to anodic waves with peak potentials at 0.70, 0.85, and 1.21 V (
