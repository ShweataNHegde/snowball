<p>The oxidative electrochemical deposition of poly-[NiAmben] under potentiodynamic conditions was monitored by the EQCM technique in order to clarify the role of ligand-centered redox reactions of the starting monomer in the polymerization. Cyclic voltammogram of a platinum-coated quartz crystal electrode recorded in the range of potentials from −0.9 to 1.3 V in the DCE-based monomer solution (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02646-f006">Figure 6</xref>a, all oxidation processes are accompanied by electrode mass increase, which starts at 0.13 V and continues until 0.38 V in the cathodic half-cycle. The broad reduction wave is accompanied by a decrease in the electrode mass. The observed mass changes are overall consistent with the surface deposition of a positively charged poly-[NiAmben] film doped with BF
