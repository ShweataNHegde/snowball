<p>To gain a better understanding of poly-[NiAmben] doping/dedoping and identify the type of electrolyte species that contribute to the redox charge balancing, the electrosynthesized film was further tested by EQCM in a monomer-free electrolyte. Two pairs of oxidation–reduction waves can be clearly observed in CV curves of the polymer-modified electrode (
