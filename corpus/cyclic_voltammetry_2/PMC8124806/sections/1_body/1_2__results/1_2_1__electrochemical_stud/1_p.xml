<p>The electrochemical behavior of [NiAmben] was investigated by cyclic voltammetry, using three different organic solvents with Et
 <sub>4</sub>NBF
 <sub>4</sub> as the supporting electrolyte. The solvents (DCE, a 50:50 (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) EC/DEC mixture, and DMSO) were selected based on their Gutmann donor numbers (DN) to provide media with varying Lewis basicity (the values of DN are 0 for DCE, 16.4 for EC, 15.1 for DEC, and 29.8 for DMSO).
