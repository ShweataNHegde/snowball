<p>The demonstrated irreversibility of one-electron oxidation of [NiAmben] in a DMSO-based electrolyte contrasts to the previously established reversibility of redox processes in [NiSalen] and many other nickel(II) complexes of N

 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-02646" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. At the same time, it has been previously shown that the analogue of [NiAmben] that contains two tBu-substituents in the

 <sup>II</sup>–anilinyl radical complex regardless of the Lewis basicity of the solvent [

  <sub>pa(I)</sub>
 </italic> could therefore be considered as ligand-based rather than metal-based and ascribed to the formation of Ni
 <sup>II</sup>–anilinyl radical cation species ([NiAmben]
 <sup>+•</sup>) in all three solvents. The value of 
 <italic>E
  <sub>pa(I)</sub>
 </italic> is shifted to more negative potentials with increasing Gutmann donor number of the electrolyte solvent. Due to its high nucleophilicity, DMSO must be able to react with the formed [NiAmben]

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-02646" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], thus effectively stabilizing them. Such stabilizing interactions between the solvent and the oxidized complex become weaker as the aprotic solvent basicity decreases, rendering the oxidized species less accessible. Repeated cycling in the potential range limited to the first redox event does not affect the voltammetric response of the system in any of the investigated electrolytes.
