<p>The CV curve of [NiAmben] obtained in the range of potentials from −0.9 to 0.9 V vs. Ag/Ag
 <sup>+</sup> (all potentials throughout the text are referred to this reference electrode) in the DMSO-based electrolyte displays three well pronounced irreversible oxidation waves with peak potentials at −0.05 V, 0.47 V, and 0.67 V, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02646-f002">Figure 2</xref>a). The voltammogram of [NiAmben] recorded in the range of potentials from −0.9 to 0.1 V shows a distinct oxidation peak at the peak potential
