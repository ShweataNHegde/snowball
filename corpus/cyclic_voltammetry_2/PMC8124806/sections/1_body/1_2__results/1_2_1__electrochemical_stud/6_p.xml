<p>Different numbers, shapes, and positions of redox waves in the voltammograms of [NiAmben] could indicate different reaction pathways for Ni
 <sup>II</sup>–anilinyl radical cations in different electrolytes as the electrode potential is scanned beyond the potentials of the first oxidation peak. The complexity of CV responses makes it challenging to unambiguously identify the nature of redox processes associated with the observed overlapping redox waves. However, it can be noted that oxidation processes yielding irreversible waves within the potential window from 0.2 to 0.9 V in a DMSO-based electrolyte (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02646-f002">Figure 2</xref>a) do not induce any significant changes in the voltammetric response of the system upon prolonged electrode potential cycling, so they could be assigned to the subsequent oxidation of DMSO-stabilized [NiAmben]
 <sup>+•</sup> species. On the contrary, when the anodic switching potential is set above the onset of the second oxidation in EC/DEC and DCE, the CV peak currents increase with slightly negative shifts in their potentials in successive cycles and new redox waves appear in the voltammetric curves, as compared with the first cycle (
