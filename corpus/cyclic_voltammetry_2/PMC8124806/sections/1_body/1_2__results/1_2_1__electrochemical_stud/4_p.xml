<p>The CV response of [NiAmben] obtained in the range of potentials between −0.9 and 1.3 V in the DCE-based electrolyte (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02646-f004">Figure 4</xref>a) shows a well-defined oxidation peak at 0.11 V, followed by two partially overlapping waves at peak potentials of 0.60 V and 0.76 V, and another oxidation peak at 1.05 V. The single reduction wave is broad and better pronounced than the one observed in EC/DEC. The voltammogram of the complex recorded in the potential range from −0.9 to 0.25 V (
