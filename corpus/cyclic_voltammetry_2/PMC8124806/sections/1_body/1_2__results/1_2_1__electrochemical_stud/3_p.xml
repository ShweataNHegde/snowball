<p>The cyclic voltammogram of [NiAmben] recorded in the potential range from −0.9 to 1.3 V in the EC/DEC-based electrolyte shows several oxidation waves in the forward scan and a broad reduction wave in the reverse scan (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02646-f003">Figure 3</xref>a). The first oxidation peak is observed at 0.02 V. The second broad oxidation wave is seen in the range of potentials between ca. 0.3 and 0.9 V (peaks are observed at 0.46 V (sh), 0.55 V, and 0.70 V) and appears to result from a mix of several redox processes at overlapping potentials. The third oxidation event occurs at potentials above 0.9 V but the current does not reach a peak before the direction of the potential sweep is reversed. The CV response of the complex in the range of potentials from −0.9 to 0.1 V (
