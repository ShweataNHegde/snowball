<p>The present study demonstrates that a nickel(II) N
 <sub>4</sub>–anilinosalen complex [NiAmben] is irreversibly oxidized in aprotic solvents and undergoes polymerization in solvent media of low and medium Lewis basicity. The highest polymerization efficiency is observed in 1,2-dichloroethane, wherein [NiAmben] appears to undergo carbon–carbon coupling in the 
 <italic>para</italic> positions of aromatic rings, yielding a robust polymer structure. The resulting poly-[NiAmben] film is electrochemically active and electrically conductive within a wide range of electrode potentials, showing two well-defined pairs of voltammetric peaks and two conductivity maxima, which reflects the switching of repeat units of the polymer between neutral, radical cationic, and dicationic states. The metallopolymer shows reversible color changes between ocher, yellow, green, and deep blue, demonstrating the electrochromic behavior concurrently with the redox reactions. Poly-[NiAmben] clearly possesses enhanced functional properties over its N
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> counterpart, poly-[NiSalen]. The advantages are largely due to the increased number of available stable redox states in the polymer. High extent of mixing of nickel(II) and ligand orbitals affords efficient charge rearrangement between redox noninnocent ligand moieties and nickel ions, and hence efficient intrachain delocalization of generated charges, contributing to high coulombic efficiency, conductivity, and stability of poly-[NiAmben], even in the heavily doped state. Impressive potential-controlled optical and charge storage properties open up multiple possibilities of using this polymer as electrode material in energy storage and saving applications.
