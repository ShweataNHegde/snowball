<p>UV-Vis absorption spectra of [NiAmben] and [NiSalen] (1 × 10
 <sup>-4</sup> M, DCE) were collected in 10 mm pathlength quartz cuvettes using an SF‒2000 spectrophotometer (OKB Spectr, Saint Petersburg, Russia). The spectrophotometer was combined with a VSP potentiostat for in situ UV-Vis spectroelectrochemical investigation of the polymer films. The working electrode was an indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated conducting glass (Sigma Aldrich, electrode area 1.0 cm
 <sup>2</sup>). A Pt wire was used as the counter electrode and an AgCl-coated Ag wire was used as the pseudo-reference electrode (its potential was close to that of an Ag/AgCl/sat’d NaCl). Electrodes were placed in a custom-made three-electrode quartz cell. Spectra were acquired in the range 300–1000 nm at fixed potentials incrementally stepped in 0.1 V intervals from −0.9 V (−0.3 V for poly-[NiSalen]) to 1.3 V (the spectra at 1.2 V have not been registered to avoid possible overoxidation of the polymers). All spectra were collected under stationary conditions (after the current remained unchanged for 120 s).
