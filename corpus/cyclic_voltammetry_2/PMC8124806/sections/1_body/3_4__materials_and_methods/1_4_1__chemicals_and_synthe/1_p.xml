<p>Procedures previously described in the literature were used to synthesize [NiAmben] [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-02646" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and [NiSalen] [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-26-02646" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Their structures were confirmed by 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR. Dimethyl sulfoxide (Acros Organics, Fair Lawn, NJ, USA, 99.7%), ethylene carbonate (Acros Organics, 99+%), diethyl carbonate (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%), and 1,2-dichloroethane (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA 99.8%) were used as received. Tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate Et
 <sub>4</sub>NBF
 <sub>4</sub> (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) was recrystallized from isopropyl alcohol and dried at 65 Â°C for 72 h before use. All solutions were prepared in an argon-filled glove box.
