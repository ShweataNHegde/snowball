<p>Electrochemical measurements were performed with a VSP potentiostat (BioLogic Science Instruments, Seyssinet-Pariset, France) at room temperature under an inert atmosphere of argon. A customized single compartment three-electrode electrochemical cell was equipped with a glassy carbon plate as the counter electrode and a non-aqueous Ag/Ag
 <sup>+</sup> reference electrode (MW‒1085, BASi) filled with a 0.005 mol L
 <sup>−1</sup> AgNO
 <sub>3</sub> solution in 0.1 M Et
 <sub>4</sub>NBF
 <sub>4</sub>/CH
 <sub>3</sub>CN (its potential was −0.3 V vs. an Ag/AgCl/sat’d NaCl).
