<p>For the combined CV/EQCM characterization tests of poly-[NiAmben] and poly-[NiSalen], a VSP potentiostat was connected to a 5 MHz QCM100 Quartz Crystal Microbalance equipped with a Metex MXC 1600 frequency counter (Metex Co, Seoul, Korea). A platinum-coated quartz crystal (electrode area 1.37 cm
 <sup>2</sup>) was used as the working electrode. The oscillation frequency of the crystal was measured by QCM in argon before the immersion in the solution for the polymerization. Polymer films were deposited onto the working electrode from a 0.05 M Et

 <sup>−1</sup> monomer by a single potential scan between −0.9 V (−0.3 V for [NiSalen]) and 1.3 V at a 0.05 V s
 <sup>−1</sup> scan rate. Before being subjected to characterization tests, the polymer-modified crystal was dried in argon until it reached a constant oscillation frequency (for about 30 min). The mass of the dry polymer film,

 <sup>−1</sup> scan rates. At least three consecutive cycles were recorded at each scan rate.
