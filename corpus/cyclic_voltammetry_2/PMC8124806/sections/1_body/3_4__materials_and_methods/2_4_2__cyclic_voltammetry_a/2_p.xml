<p>Cyclic voltammetry experiments were conducted using a glassy carbon disk (MF‒2012, BASi, IN, USA, electrode area 0.07 cm
 <sup>2</sup>) as the working electrode. The cell was filled with a solution containing a salt/solvent combination (0.05 M Et
 <sub>4</sub>NBF
 <sub>4</sub> in 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE), 0.1 M Et
 <sub>4</sub>NBF
 <sub>4</sub> in a 50:50 (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC), or 0.1 M Et
 <sub>4</sub>NBF
 <sub>4</sub> in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) and 0.001 mol L
 <sup>−1</sup> [NiAmben]. Cyclic voltammograms were recorded between −0.9 V and 1.3 V (0.9 V in DMSO) at 0.05 V s
 <sup>−1</sup>, unless indicated otherwise. When continuous potential cycling in the monomer solution yielded an insoluble deposit on the electrode surface, the electrode was transferred to the monomer-free solution, and cyclic voltammograms were recorded between −0.9 V and 1.3 V at 0.05 V s
 <sup>−1</sup>.
