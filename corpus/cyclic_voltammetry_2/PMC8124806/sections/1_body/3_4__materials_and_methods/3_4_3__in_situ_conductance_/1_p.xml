<p>In situ conductance measurements were carried out in a bipotentiostat regime with the same electrochemical cell as was used for cyclic voltammetry. Interdigitated Pt electrodes (MicruX Technologies, Gijón, Spain) with the comb distance of 5 µm served as the working electrodes. The polymer films were deposited through a CV mode at a scan rate of 0.01 V s
 <sup>−1</sup>. A constant bias of 5 mV was applied between the combs of the interdigitated electrode and the flowing current was measured as a function of potential. The conductance of the polymer was calculated from the measured current between the combs by applying Ohm’s law [

The polymer deposition process was intentionally terminated when the conductance reached a plateau, which indicated that the polymer completely filled the gap. The electrodes were then transferred to a monomer-free solution wherein in situ conductance measurements of the polymer films at 10 mV bias were performed in parallel to the voltammetric measurements at 0.01 V s
