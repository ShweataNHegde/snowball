<p>Research studies over the past several decades have demonstrated that nickel(II) complexes of tetradentate N
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> Schiff base (
 <italic>salen</italic>-type) ligands constitute attractive building blocks for the preparation of conducting metallopolymers for energy storage and saving applications. Nickel–
 <italic>salen</italic> polymers could be described as a three-dimensional mixed bonding structure composed of [Ni
 <italic>salen</italic>] units joined by different kinds of forces: covalent carbon–carbon bonds between 
 <italic>salen</italic> moieties (usually in the 
 <italic>para</italic> position of the phenyl rings) and non-covalent (intermolecular) interactions. Efficient electrochemical routes for the polymerization of the simplest representative of these compounds, N,N′-bis(salicylidene)ethylenediaminonickel(II) ([NiSalen]) and its analogues have been proposed. Charge transfer and storage, conductivity, and electrochromic properties of the obtained polymeric networks have been investigated, and the findings have been used to design polymer-modified electrodes for prototype devices. The details of the fundamental and applied studies in the area of nickel–
 <italic>salen</italic> metallopolymers can be found in several recently published reviews [
