<p>Sustainable energy has fast become the need of the century [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-26-02646" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Learning how to store harvested renewable energy and use this energy efficiently is a crucial step to overcome the global energy crisis caused by limited reserves of fossil fuels. Sustainable energy involves various technologies out of which energy storage systems (e.g., supercapacitors, rechargeable batteries) [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-26-02646" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and energy saving technologies (e.g., low energy-consumption displays, smart windows) [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-02646" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] are of utmost importance. The challenge of developing new materials to obtain more efficient energy storage and saving devices is often met through controlled modification of electrode surfaces. Electrodes for electrochemical energy storage are coated with conductive and highly capacitive materials capable of multi-electron transfer [
