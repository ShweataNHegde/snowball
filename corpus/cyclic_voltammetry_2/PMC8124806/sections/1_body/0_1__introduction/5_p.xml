 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02646-f001">Figure 1</xref>a), was first described by Pfeiffer et al. in 1937 [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-02646" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Its nickel(II) complex [NiAmben] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02646-f001">Figure 1</xref>b) formed via double deprotonation of the ligand in its reaction with a Ni(II) salt belongs to the family of N
 <sub>4</sub>–anilinosalen complexes comprising two metal-coordinated aminobenzylideneimino moieties connected together through an aliphatic bridge. The studies conducted by several research groups in the 1970s [

 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-02646" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] have shown that [NiAmben] is a square-planar complex that is more easily oxidized than its 
 <italic>salen</italic> counterpart and does not tend to increase its coordination number by the addition of strong nucleophiles, in contrast to its planar four-coordinate N
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> analogue. The latter was explained by nearly zero Lewis acidity of the metal and prompted the suggestion that the N
 <sub>4</sub> system produces a larger ligand field than the N
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> system.
