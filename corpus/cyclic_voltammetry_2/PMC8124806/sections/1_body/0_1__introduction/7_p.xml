<p>Many nickel–

 <italic>ortho</italic> and/or 
 <italic>para</italic> positions of phenyl rings tend to undergo oxidative electropolymerization, and similar behavior could be anticipated for their N
 <sub>4</sub> analogues. Although previous research studies referred to the oxidation of [NiAmben] as irreversible at high anodic potentials [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-26-02646" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], there is only one paper that describes the ability of [NiAmben] to electropolymerize onto a Pt wire under anodic polarization in a 1 M Bu
 <sub>4</sub>NClO
 <sub>4</sub>/CH
 <sub>3</sub>CN solution [
