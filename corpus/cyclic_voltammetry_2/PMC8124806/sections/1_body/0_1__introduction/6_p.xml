<p>More recent work [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-02646" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] provided major insights into the electronic structure of the stable radical cations generated by one-electron oxidation of N
 <sub>4</sub>–anilinosalen complexes with sterically hindered aminobenzylideneimino moieties (i.e., containing substituents in the 
 <italic>ortho</italic> and 
 <italic>para</italic> positions of benzene rings). In particular, it has been shown that they can be described as class III mixed valence compounds according to the Robin Day classification. The anilinyl radicals are delocalized over both aromatic moieties through the nickel ions to the higher extent as compared with the phenoxyl radicals due to better geometric and energetic matches between the anilinyl π-orbitals and out-of-plane nickel 3d orbitals. As a result, the essentially ligand-centered SOMO of the oxidized N
 <sub>4</sub>–anilinosalen complex acquires substantially higher metallic character than it does in the isoelectronic N
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> systems.
