The perspectives for practical application of a metallopolymer in sustainable energy systems are largely defined by the type, number, and stability of electrochemically available redox states as well as the efficiency of switching between them, which are in turn influenced by the extent of mixing of metal and ligand orbitals. Multiple redox states often enable advanced electrode modifying materials possessing high specific capacity and multi-color electrochromism.
