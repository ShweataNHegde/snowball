<p>Poly-[Ni
 <italic>salen</italic>] films present an interesting case of metallopolymers with metal centers directly imbedded into the conjugated organic network, which prompts possible interactions between nickel centers and organic ligand fragments in different effective redox states. In most cases, the electrochemical oxidation of nickelâ€“
 <italic>salen</italic> polymers can be described as a primarily ligand-centered process, which involves the consecutive generation of delocalized radical cations and dications in the conjugated polymer backbone and does not involve the change in the redox state of the metal [

 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-02646" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. At the same time, nickel ions constitute an essential part of charge transfer pathways in these conducting systems as they mediate the electronic coupling between the two phenolates of each [Ni
 <italic>salen</italic>] unit. As such, the characteristics of redox states generated in the film during 
 <italic>p</italic>-doping have been shown to depend on the extent of energy match between nickel and 
 <italic>salen</italic> ligand orbitals and successfully modulated through varying electronic and steric properties of ligand substituents [

Modification of the metal coordination sphere should also have an effect on the extent of mixing of metal and ligand orbitals in this type of metallopolymers. Such modification could be accomplished for example by the substitution of phenol moieties by isoelectronic aniline groups in Schiff bases.
