<p>Herein we report the effect of the Lewis basicity of the solvent on the electrochemical oxidation of [NiAmben] and its ability for oxidative electropolymerization. We investigate functional properties of the generated poly-[NiAmben] films by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM), in situ UV-Vis spectroelectrochemistry, and in situ conductance measurements to identify the redox states available in the polymer upon 
 <italic>p</italic>-doping. We use the results obtained for poly-[NiSalen] under the same conditions as a comparative model to gain insight into the effect of replacing N
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> by N
 <sub>4</sub> coordination sphere on the peculiarities of metalâ€“ligand interactions in the system as they define potential-controlled properties of polymeric nickel(II) complexes of Schiff base ligands.
