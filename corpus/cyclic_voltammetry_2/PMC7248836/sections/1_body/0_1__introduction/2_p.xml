<p>One-dimensional (1D) TiO
 <sub>2</sub> materials have been developed as anodes for LIBs such as nanotubes, nanowires, nanorods, etc. [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-02121" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Among the various nanostructured oxide materials, special attention has been directed to TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanotubes (TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs) because they have been already explored for many applications such as solar cells [
