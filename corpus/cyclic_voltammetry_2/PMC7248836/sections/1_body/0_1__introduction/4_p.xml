<p>Many efforts have been made to improve the physical and electrochemical performance of the TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanotubes such as doping with foreign atoms (N, Nb, S, V, etc.) and carbon coating [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-02121" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. For example, Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-02121" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] prepared an N-doped TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanotubes/N-doped graphene composite via hydrothermal synthesis followed by a heat treatment in the presence of urea; the galvanostatic cycling test demonstrated a discharge capacity of 90 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> at 5 A g
 <sup>−1</sup>. Kyeremateng et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-02121" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] reported that Tin-doped TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanotubes delivered higher reversible capacity compared to un-doped TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanotubes. In addition, Lopez et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-02121" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] prepared nanostructured electrodes based on the surface modification of TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanotubes with a low amount of Li
 <sub>3</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub>, and their electrochemical performances showed good cycling stability. In the present work, we report the fabrication of an all-solid-state battery consisting of TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs synthesized from ternary titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V, with 6 wt% aluminum and 4 wt% vanadium) alloy as an anode, a thin layer of polymer electrolyte, and an LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub> layer as a cathode. Electrochemical tests show an improved performance of anodized Ti-6Al-V alloy after electropolymerization, exhibiting good discharge capacity, Coulombic efficiency, and capacity retention.
