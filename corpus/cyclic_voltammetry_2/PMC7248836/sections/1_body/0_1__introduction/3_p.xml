 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-02121" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Among the approaches, the anodization technique is one of the most known and straightforward methods, which offers an extensive area of uniform nanotubes on Ti foil and allows the thickness of film oxide layer to be fine-tuned [

Recently, rechargeable all-solid-state batteries have become increasingly important to enable the miniaturization of electronic devices, the prevention of hazardous liquids, the deterioration of electrodes during cycling, and the absence of electrolyte leakage [

 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-02121" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], but several potential drawbacks are evident, such as using highly reactive lithium; the use of highly reactive metallic lithium anode requires expensive packaging technology. In addition, pure lithium is extremely volatile and has a low melting point of approximately 180.5 Â°C, which is typically lower than that in the re-flow soldering process [
