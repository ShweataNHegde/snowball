<p>In the present work, we showed that the water content in the electrolyte significantly affects the morphology of self-organized TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanotubes obtained by anodization of Ti-6Al-4V alloy. A vertically aligned and uniformly opened TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs are distributed over the alloy substrate at 20 wt% H
 <sub>2</sub>O, and by adding 5 wt% H
 <sub>2</sub>O, the nanotubes have become less uniform. The electropolymerization of the MMA-PEG into TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanotubes was carried out at different CV cycles (5, 10, and 25 cycles). After 25 cycles, the nanotubes are almost covered by a thin polymer film following the nanotubes surface rugosity. As a result, there is a significant increase in the capacity of the polymer-coated TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs compared to the bare TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs in all C-rates due to the improvement of the electrode-electrolyte interface. Therefore, polymer-coated TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs layers deliver higher stable capacity of 53.6 µAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup> µm
 <sup>−1</sup> (126.5 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>) at C/5, 36.9 µAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup> µm
 <sup>−1</sup> (87.1 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>) at C/2, and 27.4 µAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup> µm
 <sup>−1</sup> (64.7 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>) at 1C compared to that of bare TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs. The full-cell battery was composed of a polymer-coated TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs as an anode, a thin layer of MMA-PEG polymer electrolyte, and a composite LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub> cathode shows an operating voltage of 1.6 V with good electrochemical performance, not only a stable discharge capacity of 62.2 μAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup> μm
 <sup>−1</sup> (117.6 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>) after 50 cycles versus anode at C/10 but also a high capacity retention of 97.35% and a Coulombic efficiency of 96.78% beyond 50 cycles.
