<p>The electrodeposition of the polymer electrolyte into the TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs layer was confirmed by morphological analysis. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02121-f004">Figure 4</xref>aâ€“f shows the SEM images of polymer-coated TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs after a different number of CV cycles such as 5, 10, and 25 cycles, confirming the conformal deposition of the polymer electrolyte. After 25 cycles, the nanotubes are filled and almost covered by a thin polymer film, following the surface rugosity of the surface. The polymer electrolyte must be conformally deposited onto the electrodes and form a continuous layer without any pinholes in order to be used as separator to prevent the short-circuiting of the electrodes.
