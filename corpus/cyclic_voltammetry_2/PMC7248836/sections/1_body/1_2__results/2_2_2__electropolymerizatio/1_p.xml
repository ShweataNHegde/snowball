<p>In the present study, the electrochemical deposition of the polymer electrolyte into TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs is achieved by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique. The nanotubes synthesized in ethylene glycol electrolyte containing 20 wt% water are used for the electropolymerization of the polymer electrolyte into the nanotubes. The starting monomer is methyl ether methacrylate poly (ethylene glycol) (MMA-PEG, Mw: 500). The upper potential limit was set according to the open circuit voltage of the system, which is around −0.35 V versus Ag/AgCl (3M KCl), and the lower limit was set to −1V versus Ag/AgCl (3M KCl) [

The starting monomers are electropolymerized into short chains of PMA-PEG, where PMA is used to enhance the mechanical properties and PEG is responsible for the ionic conductivity of the polymer electrolyte. The reaction mechanism of MMA-PEG electropolymerization into TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs is based on the formation of intermediate hydrogen-free radicals [

 <sup>+</sup>-producing H
 <sub>2</sub> is accompanied by the formation of hydrogen-free radicals that can react with the monomers, leading to the polymerization of methyl methacrylate (PMMA). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02121-f003">Figure 3</xref> shows the cyclic voltammogram of the polymer-coated TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs for 25 cycles. Clearly, the absolute value of the cathodic current at −1 V versus Ag/AgCl (3M KCl) drops as the increment of cycles. The reason for the obvious fading can be explained by the successive growth of thin insulating polymer layers on the walls of TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs.
