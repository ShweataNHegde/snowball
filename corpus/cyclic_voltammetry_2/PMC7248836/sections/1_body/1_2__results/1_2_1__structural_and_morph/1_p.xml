 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02121-f001">Figure 1</xref> displays the XRD pattern of the TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs before and after annealing treatment. As can be seen, some peaks located at 2θ = 35.6°, 38.7°, 40.6°, 53.3°, 63.6°, 71.1°, and 76.9° (Titanium, JCPDS 01-1197) can be attributed to Ti metal, and no visible diffraction peaks assigned to crystalline TiO
 <sub>2</sub> are observed after anodization, indicating that the samples are amorphous [

 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-02121" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The samples reveal sharp and strong peaks, which indicate that the as-annealed TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs arrays have crystallized. The typical peaks observed at 2θ = 25.4° and 48.3° can be assigned to crystal phases of TiO
 <sub>2</sub> (tetragonal, anatase, JCPDS 21-1272); the anatase peaks correspond to the planes (101) and (002), respectively. Furthermore, no peak of Al and V oxides are observed in the XRD patterns, which may be due to the very low percentage in the sample [
