<p>The water content plays a significant role in the dissolution rate, meaning that the increase in the water content leads to the faster dissolution of the oxide layer. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02121-f002">Figure 2</xref> shows the SEM micrographs of the anodized nanotubes grown on Ti-6Al-4V alloy in the ethylene glycol electrolyte with different water contents (20 wt% and 25 wt%). When the water content of 20% is employed, vertically aligned and uniformly opened TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs are distributed over the alloy substrate with accessible pores on the surface. An inner diameter of the TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs varies between 90 and 210 nm. Indeed, the TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs structure does not collapse, implying that the nanotube arrays maintained better thermostability during annealing treatment at 450 °C. The length of the tubes of 1.25 µm has been estimated from the SEM cross-section view (see the inset 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02121-f002">Figure 2</xref>a). In contrast, at higher water content of 25 wt%, the surface shows some debris, and the appearance of the surface is less uniform (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02121-f002">Figure 2</xref>b). This phenomenon is commonly found in polyphase alloys due to the presence of different phases, resulting in a preferential dissolution of less stable elements. The selective dissolution of heterogeneous alloy is reduced at a water content of 20 wt%, and the nanotube arrays formed uniformly for α and β phases.
