 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02121-f002">Figure 2</xref>c illustrates the energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis for the elemental identification of the anodized Ti-6Al-4V alloy. The EDS spectrum of the sample indicates that Ti, O, Al, and V are present at the surface of anodized Ti-6Al-4V alloy. The strong percentage of O suggests that the oxidation of all elements occurred. In contrary to anodized pure Ti, F is not incorporated in oxides during the anodization process.
