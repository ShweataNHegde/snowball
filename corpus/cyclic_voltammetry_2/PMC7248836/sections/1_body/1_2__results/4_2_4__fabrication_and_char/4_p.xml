 <sub>2</sub> NTs/polymer/LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub> full-cell recorded at multi-C rates for 50 cycles. The battery delivers capacity values of 63 μAh cm

 <sup>−1</sup> (119 mAh g

 <sup>−2</sup> μm
 <sup>−1</sup> (43.5 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>) at C/2, which are well recovered after the fast cycling rate (C/2). The high capacities for the TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs/polymer/LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub> full-cell are attributed to the enhanced surface area between the nanotubes and the gel polymer electrolyte, hence providing a robust and a high quality electrode–electrolyte interface for long charge–discharge cycles
 <sup>36</sup>. The better electrode–electrolyte contact established between the electrode and polymer electrolyte drastically facilitates the insertion and diffusion of Li
 <sup>+</sup>. Furthermore, calculated using a working voltage of approximately 1.6 V and taking into account the reversible areal capacity of the polymer-coated TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs (69 μAh cm
