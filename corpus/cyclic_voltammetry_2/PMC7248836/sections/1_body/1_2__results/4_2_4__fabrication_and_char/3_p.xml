<p>Since the limiting reactant material of the thin-film battery is TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs, the capacity values are reported versus the mass and the surface of the anode. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02121-f007">Figure 7</xref>c shows the galvanostatic charge/discharge profile of the battery consisting of a TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs/Polymer/LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub> full-cell in the potential window of 0.5–2.8 V cycled at the C/10 rate. At the first cycle, the initial charge and discharge capacities recorded at the C/10 rate are 66 μAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup> μm
 <sup>−1</sup> (155.8 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>) and 63.9 μAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup> μm
 <sup>−1</sup> (150.8 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>), resulting in a high Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 96.8% and high capacity retention of 97.4% after 50 cycles at the C/10 rate. The discharge plateau at approximately 1.75  V and a charge plateau at approximately 1.50 V almost match with the two intensive peaks in the CV curves. By taking the middle point of two plateaus, we noted that the operating cell voltage of the TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs/Polymer/LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub> full-cell is approximately 1.6 V. An additional plateau observed at 0.75 V could be attributed to the insertion of Li
 <sup>+</sup> from LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub> to the VO
 <sub>2</sub> structure. This result is in agreement with the galvanostatic cycling, resulting in half-cell TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs on Ti-6Al-4V alloy where the plateau at 2.62 V corresponds to the VO
 <sub>2</sub> phase.
