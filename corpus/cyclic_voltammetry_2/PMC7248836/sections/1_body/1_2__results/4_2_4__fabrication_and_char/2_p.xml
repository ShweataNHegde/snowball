<p>The promising performances of the polymer-coated TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs suggested it as a suitable anode material for application in full all-solid-state Li-ion batteries using the LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub> cathode material, as schematically depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02121-f007">Figure 7</xref>a. Note that for this battery, the polymer electrolyte is deposited via electropolymerization reaction for 25 cycles CV. The polymer thin film deposited atop the TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs during the electropolymerization process serves as a continuous layer with an additional drop-cast polymer layer, with the total thickness of the polymer electrolyte layer being approximately 200 µm. As seen in

 <sub>2</sub> NTs/polymer/LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub> full-cell by performing the cyclic voltammetry (CV) test is investigated. The CV curves of the full-cell recorded at the scanning rate of 0.5 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup> exhibit well-defined redox peaks. The presence of the oxidation peaks at 1.93 V is attributed to the extraction of Li
 <sup>+</sup> from the cathode and their subsequent insertion into the anode material. By contrast, reduction peaks at 1.21 V are assigned to the extraction of Li
 <sup>+</sup> from the anode and their simultaneous insertion into the cathode according to the reactions given in Equations (10)–(12).
