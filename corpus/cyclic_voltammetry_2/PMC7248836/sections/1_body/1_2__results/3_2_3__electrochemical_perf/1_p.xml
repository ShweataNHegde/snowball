<p>To gain deeper insight into the positive influence of the electropolymerization approach, the bare TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs and the polymer-coated TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs were investigated as anode materials for Li-ion batteries. Herein, the synthesized TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs with 20 wt% H
 <sub>2</sub>O has been used to study the charging and discharging mechanisms during the electrochemical cycling experiments. The samples were tested at scanning rates of 0.5 mV s
 <sup>–1</sup> in the potential range between 1 and 3 V versus Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup> at room temperature, as displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02121-f005">Figure 5</xref>a,b. The distinctive anodic and cathodic peaks represent the redox reactions of the electrodes with Li
 <sup>+</sup>, which is responsible for the electrode phase transformations. The redox peaks are well-defined and distinguishable (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02121-f005">Figure 5</xref>a). The Li
 <sup>+</sup> insertion (cathodic peak) and extraction (anodic peak) occur at the potential of 1.68 and 2.06 V versus Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup>, respectively. The slightly decrease of the current densities in the absolute cathodic and anodic peak indicates the small discharge capacity fading upon cycling. However, after first cycle, well-overlapped redox peaks are visible, indicating a good electrochemical stability of the electrode. An additional peak pair at a potential of approximately 2.62 V versus Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup> with a low current density is also appeared due to the presence of an electrochemically active VO
 <sub>2</sub> phase, but the VO
 <sub>2</sub> phase does not significantly contribute to the storage performance of the electrode [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-02121" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The similar behavior is observed for the bare TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs, showing the anodic peak at 2.08 V versus Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup> and cathodic peak at 1.63 V versus Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02121-f005">Figure 5</xref>b). The CV of the bare TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs clearly indicates a lower electrochemical activity and lithium ions storage compared to that of polymer-coated TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs, as shown by a smaller sweeping area and a lower oxidation and reduction peak current density. Moreover, the peak separation of the polymer-coated TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs is substantially lower than that of bare TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs, suggesting a lower polarization.
