 <sub>2</sub> NTs for all C-rates. Polymer-coated TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs layers deliver a stable capacity of 53.6 µAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup> µm

 <sup>−2</sup> µm
 <sup>−1</sup> (64.7 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>) at 1C. The capacities can be recovered at C/10 for both samples. Herein, we note a large irreversible capacity at the first initial cycles for both samples, which may originate from the side reaction between the electrodes and Li
 <sup>+</sup>, as well as the presence of residual water at the surface of TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs after electropolymerization. This phenomenon is in agreement with the previous reports [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-25-02121" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]; the polymerization of MMA monomer during the electrochemical cycling test could occur, and the increasing viscosity of the electrolyte might lead to the decrement of the ionic conductivity. The enhanced capacity and good rate capability of the polymer-coated TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs can be ascribed to the lower interfacial resistance due to the better interfacial contact between the anode and polymer electrolyte; hence, it also enhances the diffusion of Li ions. Indeed, the Coulombic efficiency of the electrode is significantly improved close to 100% upon cycling (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02121-f005">Figure 5</xref>f). It should be noted that the increment in the capacity is obtained for the polymer-coated TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs for 25 cycles CV due to the enhancement of the electrode–electrolyte interface between the TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs and the polymer electrolyte. Additionally, the electropolymerization process helps in exploiting the full active surface area of the nanotubes and hence obtaining the contribution from the whole electrode surface.
