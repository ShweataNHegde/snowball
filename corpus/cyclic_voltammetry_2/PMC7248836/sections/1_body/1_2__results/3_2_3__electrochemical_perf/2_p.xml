 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02121-f005">Figure 5</xref>c,d depicts the galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles of polymer-coated TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs. The profiles display flat plateaus of charge at 1.85 V versus Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup> and discharge 1.76 V versus Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup>, which are typical profiles for anatase TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs as obtained from XRD results. The first charge and discharge capacities for polymer-coated TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs are 74.9 µAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup> µm
 <sup>−1</sup> (176.8 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>) and 139.2 µAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup> (328.5 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>) µm
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively, corresponding to a Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 53.78%. Meanwhile, the bare TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs shows flat plateaus of charge at 1.86 V versus Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup> and discharge 1.74 V versus Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup>, a delivering charge capacity of 59 µAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup> µm
 <sup>−1</sup> (139.2 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>) and a discharge capacity of 132.5 µAh cm
 <sup>−2</sup> µm
 <sup>−1</sup> (312.7 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup>) with a significantly lower CE of 44.5% compared to that of polymer-coated TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs. The specific discharge capacity of the polymer-coated TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs is higher compared to some previous studies. For instance, Fasakin et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-25-02121" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] reported that an anatase TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs prepared from pristine anatase TiO
 <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles via a low temperature modified stirring-hydrothermal technique delivered a capacity of 160 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> at a specific current of 36 mA g
 <sup>−1</sup>. Auer et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-02121" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] studied the TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs synthesized by a two-step anodization process, and the anatase TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs exhibited a reversible capacity of 185 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> (Li
 <sub>0.55</sub>TiO
 <sub>2</sub>) at a slow C-rate (C/20). In addition, Savva et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-25-02121" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] synthesized ordered TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs via electrochemical anodization and subsequently annealed under N
 <sub>2</sub> and water-vapor (WV) atmospheres. The obtained capacities for the N
 <sub>2</sub> and WV-treated TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs were 231.9 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> and 230.6 mAh g
 <sup>−1</sup> at C/20, respectively.
