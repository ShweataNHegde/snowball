<p>For the TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs anode, there was no need to further mix with any additive due to their self-supported structure. For the positive electrode materials, the LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub> powder was synthesized as previously reported [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-25-02121" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Each material was mixed with carbon black (Super P) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) at the ratio of 80:10:10. 
 <italic>N</italic>-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) was added in the powder mixture to obtain a paste. The paste was spread on an Al disk (diameter of 8 mm) that was used as the current collector. The electrode was dried at 110 Â°C for 8 h.
