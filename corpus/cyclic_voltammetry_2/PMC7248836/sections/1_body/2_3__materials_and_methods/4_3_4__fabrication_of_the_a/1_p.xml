<p>All-solid-state batteries were assembled using bare and polymer-coated TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs and LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub>. After drying the polymer-coated TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs electrode at 70 °C for 24 h, 7 µL of the MMA-PEG carrying LiTFSI salt was drop-casted at the polymer-coated TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs surface. The sample was dried again under vacuum at 70 °C for 24 h to obtain a homogeneous polymer thin film. The cells consisting of a polymer-coated TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs anode and an LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub> cathode were assembled in an argon-filled glove box (MBraun, Munich, Germany) with &lt;0.5 ppm H
 <sub>2</sub>O and &lt;0.5 ppm O
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere. The LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub> composite cathode on the Al disk was pressed to polymer-coated TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs and a polymer electrolyte dropcast. Two wires were connected to the backside of each current collector using silver conductive paste and wires.
