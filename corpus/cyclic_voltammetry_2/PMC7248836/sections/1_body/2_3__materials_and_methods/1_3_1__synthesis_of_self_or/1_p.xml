<p>The Ti–6Al–4V alloy (0.1 mm thick, 25% tolerance, Goodfellow) was cut into 1.2 cm × 1.2 cm and ultrasonically cleaned in acetone, 2-propanol, and methanol for 10 min each. Then, the treated foils were rinsed with ultrapure water and dried in compressed air. At room temperature, the anodization was performed in a two-electrode electrochemical cell with Ti-6Al-4V alloy as the working electrode and Pt foil as the counter electrode in ethylene glycol electrolyte containing 0.3 wt% ammonium fluoride (NH
 <sub>4</sub>F) with two different water contents (20 and 25 wt%). All anodization experiments were carried out under a constant voltage of 60 V using a generator (ISO-TECH IPS-603) for 3 h [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-02121" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. After the anodization, the samples were removed from the electrochemical cell and they were dried in compressed air. The as-prepared samples were annealed at 450 °C for 3 h with a heating rate of 5 °C/min.
