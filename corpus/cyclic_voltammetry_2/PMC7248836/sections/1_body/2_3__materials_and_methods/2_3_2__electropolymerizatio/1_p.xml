<p>The electropolymerization was performed by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique in a three-electrode configuration consisting of the layer of TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs as the working electrode, a Pt foil as the counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl (3M KCl) as the electrode. An aqueous solution of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and MMA-PEG monomer was mixed and stirred for 3 h; then, the solution was introduced into the cell. Prior to the electropolymerization, the solution was purged with N
 <sub>2</sub> for 10 min to eliminate dissolved oxygen. Cyclic voltammetry tests were carried out in a cathodic current with a potential range of −0.35 to −1 V versus Ag/AgCl (3M KCl) at the scan rate of 10 mV s
 <sup>−1</sup> for 5, 10, and 25 cycles. After the CVs, the sample was removed from the cell without rinsing and dried in the BUCHI vacuum dryer at 70 °C overnight to evaporate the residual water.
