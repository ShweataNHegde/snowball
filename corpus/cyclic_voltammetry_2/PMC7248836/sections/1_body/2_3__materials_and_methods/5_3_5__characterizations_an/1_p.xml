<p>The surface morphology of the self-organized TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs was examined using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Ultra-55, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The purity of TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Diffractometer D5000 (Siemens, Munich, Germany) with CuK
 <sub>α1</sub> (λ= 1.5406 Å) radiation. Then, they were analyzed by comparing with the JCDS-ICDD database (Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards—International Center for Diffraction Data, Newtown Square, PA, USA) to check the purity of the samples.
