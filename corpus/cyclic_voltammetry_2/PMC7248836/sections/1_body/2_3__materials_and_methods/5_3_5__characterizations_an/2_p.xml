<p>For the Swagelok test cells employing the gel electrolyte, the separators were prepared by soaking each circular sheet (diameter of 10 mm) of the Whatman glass microfiber with 80 µL of a mixture of 10 mL of 0.5 M LiTFSI with 2.5 g MMA-PEG. The separators were dried overnight at 70 °C in the BUCHI vacuum dryer. For the electrochemical performance tests, bare TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs and polymer-coated TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs having a surface area of 0.50 cm
 <sup>2</sup> were used as electrodes without the use of any binders and conductive additives, assembling using standard two-electrode Swagelok cells. All cells assembly were conducted in a glove box that was filled with high-purity argon atmosphere in which the moisture and oxygen contents were less than 0.5 ppm. Cyclic voltammetry tests were carried out using a VMP3 (Bio Logic, Seyssinet-Pariset, France) in the potential window of 1–3 V versus Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup> with a scan rate of 0.5 mV s

 <sub>2</sub> NTs. Galvanostatic charge–discharge cycles were performed with a VMP3 (Bio Logic) in the potential window between 1 and 3 V versus Li/Li
 <sup>+</sup>. The Swagelok test cells were assembled in an Argon-filled glove box. In the half-cell system, TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NTs electrodes were assembled against metallic Li foil using the gel electrolyte of LiTFSI and MMA-PEG. The Li foil was cut in a circular shape with the diameter of 9 mm, and two circular sheets (10 mm in diameter) of the gel electrolyte in the Whatman paper were used as the separator. For the LiFePO
 <sub>4</sub> electrodes, cyclic voltammetry tests were carried out in the potential window of 2–4.2 V versus Li/Li
