<p>Several solvents, such as water, organic solvents, and supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO
 <sub>2</sub>), have been tested for ILs extraction processes. Aqueous two-phase extraction (ATPE) is used when two immiscible phases (both soluble in water), e.g., polymer/polymer, polymer/salt, or salt/salt, are placed into contact with each other above the critical concentration at a specific temperature. This type of extraction is recognized since it is a rapid, low-cost, and scalable technology for separation and purification of antibiotics, enzymes, therapeutic proteins, etc. In this method, the ILs can be concentrated and recovered in the IL-rich phase.
