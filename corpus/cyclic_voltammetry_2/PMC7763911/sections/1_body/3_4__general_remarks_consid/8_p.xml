<p>Recently, Margulis et al. [
 <xref rid="B80-molecules-25-05812" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] classified ILs structure in three possible structural motifs associated with (i) vicinal interactions, (ii) formation of positive–negative charge-alternating chains or networks, and (iii) alternation of these networks with apolar domains. They concluded that friction and mobility of Ils are nowhere close of being spatially homogeneous, and called “mechanical heterogeneity” to this phenomem, where charge networks are intrinsically stiff and charge-depleted regions are softer, flexible, and mobile. Moreover, they proposed that charge blurring associated with the loss of memory of where charges (positive and negative) are within networks is the key mechanism associated with viscosity in ILs. An IL will have low viscosity if a characteristic charge-blurring decorrelation time is low [
 <xref rid="B81-molecules-25-05812" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Lower viscosity implies higher conductivity and more efficient mass transport for the applications of electrochemical systems. The anion is responsible for viscosity, so its proper selection would have advantageous implications in the system environment where transport properties are pivotal. Therefore, the physicochemical properties and structure–property relationships of the ionic species in ILs, especially the effects of cationic structures on the transport properties, including viscosity, conductivity, and electrochemical properties, are still in need of more studies.
