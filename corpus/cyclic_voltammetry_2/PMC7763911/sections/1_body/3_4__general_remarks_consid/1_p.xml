<p>From the above-mentioned published contributions, it is clear that impurities, such as water content or contamination with halides, can lead to significant changes in the expected electrochemical results. Therefore, purifying the ILs is a basic requirement to obtain reliable cyclic voltammograms. Several technologies, i.e., adsorption, aqueous two-phase extraction, crystallization, distillation, extraction, membrane separation, and external force field separation, have been investigated for the recovery and purification of ILs either in the lab or at pilot scale.</p>
