<p>According to the authors, the experimental voltammograms suggested the presence of a nucleation phenomenon (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05812-f002">Figure 2</xref>), but mainly in a qualitative way. The electrodeposition of copper occurs, and the explanation given is that the formation of stable Cu nuclei on an inert surface requires a potential more negative than the reduction of Cu(I) on a copper surface. Chronoamperometry was also performed to understand the nucleation/growth process of copper on a Pt wire and a Pt disc electrode.
