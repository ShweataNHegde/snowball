<p>The stability constants of Eu(III)–ligand complex showed that the stability of Eu-DHOA complex in ionic liquid medium was lower than that of the Eu-TBP complex, and therefore the use of DHOA ligand for facilitating the electrodeposition of europium from the ionic liquid during the recovery of europium by extraction–electrodeposition (EX-EL) procedure would be the best option.</p>
