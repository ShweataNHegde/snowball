<p>Besides the usage of ILs themselves as electrolytes, some authors have applied them as electrolyte additives. For example, very recently [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-25-05812" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], [emim][NTf
 <sub>2</sub>] was studied by cyclic voltammetry for usage as possible additive to the electrolyte in sodium ion batteries Electrochemical cycling of a hard carbon electrode reveals that the [NTf
 <sub>2</sub>]
 <sup>-</sup> anion, mainly coming from the added ionic liquid, can introduce new peaks in the cyclic voltammograms or new steps in the galvanostatic discharge. The products of such degradation can make an interface which determines the cycling properties.
