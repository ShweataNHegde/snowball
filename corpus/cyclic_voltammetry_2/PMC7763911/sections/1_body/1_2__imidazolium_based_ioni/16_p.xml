<p>Sengupta et al., [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-05812" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] used [bmim][NTf
 <sub>2</sub>] to report a first-ever cyclic voltammetric electrochemical characterization of neptunium(IV) complexes bearing the diglycolamide ligand. Np(IV) was found to undergo mono-electron exchange reactions. The activation energy values were deduced using the Arrhenius equation and thermodynamic parameters were derived using linear regression of the data. The redox reactions of the Np(IV) complexes were exothermic. In a further study, the authors [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-25-05812" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] detected, by cyclic voltammetry, a different electrochemical behaviour for neptunium(IV) bearing diphenyl-N,N-diisobutylcarbamoyl-methylphosphine oxide in [bmim][NTf
 <sub>2</sub>] (CMPO-NTf
 <sub>2</sub>): for the redox couples involving complexes of Np(IV) with CMPO or CMPO-NTf
 <sub>2</sub>, the enthalpy values were positive or endothermic.
