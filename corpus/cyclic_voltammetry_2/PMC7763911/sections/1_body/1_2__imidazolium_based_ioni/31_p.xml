<p>[Emim][N(Tf
 <sub>2</sub>)] was also used for studying the electrochemistry of I
 <sup>−</sup>, I
 <sub>2</sub> and ICl, together with [bmim][Cl], due to the integral role of the I
 <sup>−</sup>/I
 <sup>3−</sup> couple in dye-sensitized solar cell technology [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-25-05812" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Bentley et al., used the cyclic voltammetric technique at a platinum macrodisk electrode in neat ILs, as well as a binary mixture of [bmim]Cl and [emim][N(Tf
 <sub>2</sub>)]. The neutral (I
 <sub>2</sub>) and positive (I
 <sup>+</sup>) oxidation states of iodine are known to have strongly electrophilic behavior, and thus the I
 <sup>−</sup>/I
 <sub>2</sub>/I
 <sup>+</sup> redox processes are sensitive to the presence of nucleophilic chloride or bromide. These anions are both commonly present as impurities in non haloaluminate RTILs. In the absence of chloride (e.g., in neat [emim][N(Tf
 <sub>2</sub>)], I
 <sup>−</sup> was oxidized in an overall one electron per iodide ion process to I
 <sub>2</sub> via an I
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>−</sup> intermediate, gave rise to two resolved I
 <sup>−</sup>/I
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>−</sup> and I
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>/I
 <sub>2</sub> processes. When Cl
 <sup>-</sup> and I
 <sup>−</sup> were present, even in low concentrations (below 30 mM), an additional oxidation process appears at potentials less positive than the I
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>/I
 <sub>2</sub> process. This corresponded, according to the authors, to the oxidation of I
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>−</sup> to the inter-halide complex anion [ICl
 <sub>2</sub>]
 <sup>−</sup> in an overall two electrons per iodide ion process.
