 <sup>+</sup> redox couple. The authors were able to elucidate the electrochemical reductive mechanism involved in the reduction of thymine and thymidine in [bmim][BF
 <sub>4</sub>] by convolutive semi-integral analysis of the cyclic voltametric data produced. The electrochemical reduction of thymine followed a one-electron transfer at the electrode surface resulting in the formation of electron adducts of thymine at the cathode peak. This mechanism is supported by theoretical simulations of the variation of bond dissociation free energy via the concerted sticky dissociative model [
