<p>Later, Rama et al., [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-05812" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] used [bmim][NTf
 <sub>2</sub>] to investigate the electrochemistry performance of U(VI). The cyclic voltammogram of U(VI) in [bmim][NTf
 <sub>2</sub>]
 <italic>,</italic> recorded at a glassy carbon working electrode at the scan rate of 100 mV/s at 373 K, exhibited a prominent quasi-reversible reduction of U(VI) to U(V) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05812-f007">Figure 7</xref>), where the cathodic peak potential was shifted anodically and the cathodic peak current increased with the increase of temperature. The presence of tri-n-octyl phosphate (TOP) or tri-n-butyl phosphate (TBP, a reference extractant) ligands shifted the cathodic peak to more negative potentials due to the formation of a U(VI) complex (compare
