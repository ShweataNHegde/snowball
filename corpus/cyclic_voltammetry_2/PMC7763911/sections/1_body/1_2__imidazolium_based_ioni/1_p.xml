<p>The imidazolium based ILs constitute the class of ionic liquids most used in electrochemical applications. The ones bearing two to four carbon atoms in the cation chain length, such as 1–butyl–3–methyl–imidazolium [bmim] or 1–ethyl–3–methyl–imidazolium [emim], respectively, are preferred, namely for electrodeposition processes.</p>
