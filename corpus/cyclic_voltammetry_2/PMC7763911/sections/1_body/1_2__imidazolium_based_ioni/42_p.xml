 <sub>2</sub>S occurred at a very high/low potential, close to the upper/lower limit of the electrochemical window of the RTILs. This behaviour led to the conclusion that they were unsuitable for H
 <sub>2</sub>S sensing. Moreover, the addition of MEA to [C
 <sub>3</sub>OHmim][BF
 <sub>4</sub>] electrolyte (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05812-f011">Figure 11</xref>D increases the solubility of H
 <sub>2</sub>S through chemical absorption, releasing electroactive HS-ions, which subsequently led to an additional anodic response at a potential appropriate for the detection of H
 <sub>2</sub>S. As a final remark, in this study it was possible to conclude that the detection is not affected by ambient gases such as CO
 <sub>2</sub> or SO
 <sub>2</sub>.
