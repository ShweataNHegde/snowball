<p>One very interesting work involving the application of ionic liquids as electrolyte additives was developed by Wong et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-05812" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], who studied the concentration of [emim][BF
 <sub>4</sub>] in an electrolyte to optimize the capacitive performance of high-energy density graphene supercapacitors. The authors reported that the electrolyte viscosity increased exponentially with the increase of IL concentration, while the ionic conductivity decreased with an increase in IL concentration. They also found a strong dependence of the specific capacitance not only on the electrolyte viscosity and ionic conductivity, but also in the maximum working voltage (MWV) where the electrode specific capacitance increases. The neat IL (i.e., [emim][BF
 <sub>4</sub>]) offered the largest specific capacitance and energy density among all IL concentrations for graphene-based electric double-layer capacitors (EDLC), despite having the highest viscosity and the lowest ionic conductivity. The large specific capacitance and energy density was also due to the largest MWV offered by this neat ILs. Another advantage reported by the authors was that, if the EDLC does not require to operate at the electrochemical stability window of the IL, diluted IL electrolytes with an optimized concentration/IL viscosity can be used instead. To sum up, they concluded that the concentration of IL electrolyte should be optimized according to the working voltage required.
