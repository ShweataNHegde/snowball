<p>Silver was present in [bmim][NTf
 <sub>2</sub>] in the form of uncoordinated or weakly coordinated Ag
 <sup>+</sup> ions, and therefore represented the simplest electrochemical system. Homogeneous and crack-free silver coatings were potentiostatically obtained from this ionic liquid. The authors used a “dry” and a “wet” sample, were the water content was determined by Karl Fischer titration. The electroreduction of Ag
 <sup>+</sup> was favoured in the “wet” system, but in both cases the reverse sweep showed a current crossover and a reduction peak that was dependent on the scan rate. Moreover, when they increased the scan rate, the peak potential value moved towards more negative values. Both of these observations are indicative that silver electroreduction follows a nucleation-growth mechanism. Thus, chronoamperometric measurements were carried out by stepwise variations of the potential of the working electrode from a value where no reduction of silver occurs to potentials sufficiently negative to induce the reduction process. In this manner, the electro-crystallization mechanism, by comparing experimental data with calculated values obtained from a theoretical model, was determined by the authors, that also compared their observations with previous published results obtained using other types of ionic liquids. They concluded that, in the “wet” system, the overpotential required to start the electroreduction is lower and the maximum current value is higher. This phenomenon was partially attributed to the enhanced Ag
 <sup>+</sup> ion mobility due to the decreased viscosity of the electrochemical medium resulting from the presence of a larger amount of water. In the dry system, probably due to the lower mobility of the electroactive species, the effect of overpotential is less marked.
