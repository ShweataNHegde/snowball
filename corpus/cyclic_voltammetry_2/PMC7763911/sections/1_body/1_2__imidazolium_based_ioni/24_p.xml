 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-05812" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] applied 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, [emim][NTf
 <sub>2</sub>], for the recharge of lithium batteries, with promising results. They formed a gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) for high performance lithium polymer batteries (LPBs). The gel is based on the polymer polyethylene oxide and the lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide salt. By cyclic voltammetric studies, the authors discovered that the gel exhibits promising characteristics suitable for application in LPBs. The GPEs show high thermal stability, high ionic conductivity, high lithium transference number and high electrochemical stability window. One year later, Prasanna and collaborators [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-25-05812" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] reported the use of [bmim][NTf
 <sub>2</sub>] incorporated in a polymeric matrix, containing polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and poly(ethyl methacrylate) (PEMA), for the electrochemical study of zinc ion conducting gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs). The prepared films of gel polymer membranes were fully characterized utilizing complex impedance spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry thermogravimetric, and cyclic voltammetry analyses. A similar trend was observed for the dielectric constant and ionic conductivity with the increase of [emim][NTf
 <sub>2</sub>] concentration.
