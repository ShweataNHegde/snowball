<p>Gupta et al. [

 <italic>N</italic>-diethylcarbamoylmethylphosphonate (DHDECMP) ligand (as complexing extractant) in [bmim][NTf
 <sub>2</sub>]. The reduction of Eu(III) to Eu(II) in [bmim][NTf
 <sub>2</sub>] has shown a quasi-reversible reduction, at a peak potential of âˆ’1.44 V vs. Fc/Fc
 <sup>+</sup> (Fc = ferrocene), and was controlled by diffusion and charge transfer kinetics (
