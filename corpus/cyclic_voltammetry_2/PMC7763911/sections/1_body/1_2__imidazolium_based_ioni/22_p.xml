 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05812-f008">Figure 8</xref>A, we can see clearly three well-defined redox couples centred at −1.37, 0.63, and 0.90 V corresponding to V

 <sup>5+</sup> couples is 2.0 V, which is comparable to several organic solvents. Such a decrease in ΔE for consecutive redox waves upon changing solvents from acetonitrile to RTILs seems to demonstrate that the RTIL are more basic than most of the common organic solvents. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05812-f008">Figure 8</xref>B,C show that the [V(acac)
 <sub>3</sub>] redox couples were not clearly discernible in [bmim][BF
 <sub>4</sub>] and [bmim][PF
 <sub>6</sub>]. In [emim][N(CN)
 <sub>2</sub>] and [emim][EtSO
 <sub>4</sub>], the redox couple at positive potentials was chemically irreversible (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05812-f008">Figure 8</xref>D,E). Interesting is in the particular case of [emim][N(CN)
 <sub>2</sub>], were a cathodic, return peak did appear as the scan rate increased and the ratio of the cathodic to anodic peak currents, also increased. This suggests that a following chemical reaction occurred after oxidation.
