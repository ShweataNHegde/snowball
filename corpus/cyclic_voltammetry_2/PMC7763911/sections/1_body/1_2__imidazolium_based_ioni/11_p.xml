<p>An IL with a higher cation chain length, [hmim][NTf
 <sub>2</sub>] (hmim = 1–hexyl–3–methyl–imidazolium), was applied in the study of the redox properties of europium(III) for the recovery of europium by an extraction–electrodeposition (EX-EL) procedure [

 <sub>2</sub>], recorded at a glassy carbon electrode, exhibited a prominent quasi-reversible reduction wave occurring at the onset of −0.25 V vs. Fc/Fc
 <sup>+</sup> (Fc = ferrocene), culminating in a peak at −0.84 V vs. Fc/Fc
 <sup>+</sup> assigned to the reduction of Eu(III) to Eu(II), as shown in
