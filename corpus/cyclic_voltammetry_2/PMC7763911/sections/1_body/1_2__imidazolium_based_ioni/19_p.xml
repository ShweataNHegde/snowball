<p>The above work was followed by the use of imidazolium-based IL bearing the dicyanamide anion [bmim][DCA], by the same researchers [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-25-05812" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], to study the electrochemical behaviour of UO
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>2+</sup>. The cathodic peaks corresponding to the reduction of UO
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>2+</sup> to UO
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> and then to UO
 <sub>2</sub> were clearly detected, indicating that [bmim][DCA] is a good solvent for this lanthanide cation.
