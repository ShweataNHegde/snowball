<p>The oxidation peaks were mainly associated to the redox reactions undergone by the transition metals present at LiNi
 <sub>0.5</sub>Mn
 <sub>1.5</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>/Li. Moreover, the electrolyte with 15 vol.% of [cpmim][NTf
 <sub>2</sub>] had good integrity and large current density. The redox peaks of 20 vol.% of [cpmim][NTf
 <sub>2</sub>] presented lower current intensity than the others, and the oxidation peak was anodically shifted. The authors presented two possible reasons for this shift. One was that the high viscosity of 20 vol.% of [cpmim][NTf
 <sub>2</sub>] increased the internal resistance and the other reason may be related to the high concentration of ionic liquids that led to an enrichment phenomenon on the surface of cathode due to the charge of ionic liquid. As a consequence, the surface structure of the cathode was changed, and thus the peak had a slight shift. Even so, the authors concluded that the mixed electrolyte with [cpmim][NTf
 <sub>2</sub>] is promising to be used in the application of Li-ion batteries.
