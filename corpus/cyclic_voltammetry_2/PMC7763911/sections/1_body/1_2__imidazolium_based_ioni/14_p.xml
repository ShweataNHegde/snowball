 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-05812" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], attached the neutral ligand DHOA to [bmim][NTf
 <sub>2</sub>] to study the electrodeposition of a series of lanthanides (Ln), such as europium, neodymium, or dysprosium. The reduction of Eu
 <sup>3+</sup>, Nd
 <sup>3+</sup>, and Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> to their respective metallic forms was successfully achieved (
