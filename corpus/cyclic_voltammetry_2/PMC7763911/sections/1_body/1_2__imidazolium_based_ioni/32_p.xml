<p>Also, the electrochemistry of I
 <sup>−</sup>, I
 <sub>2</sub>, and ICl has been investigated by cyclic voltammetry in a binary IL mixture composed of [bmim]Cl and [emim][NTf
 <sub>2</sub>], using the same experimental conditions. The authors studied the effect of the presence of a large excess of Cl
 <sup>−</sup> ([I
 <sup>−</sup>] ≈ 10 mM and [Cl
 <sup>−</sup>] ≈ 3.7 M) and observed that I
 <sup>−</sup> was oxidized in an overall two electrons per iodide ion process to [ICl
 <sub>2</sub>]
 <sup>−</sup> via an [I
 <sub>2</sub>Cl]
 <sup>−</sup> intermediate. Bentley and coworkers concluded that in the I
 <sup>−</sup>/I
 <sub>2</sub>/I
 <sup>+</sup> processes, in non haloaluminate ILs, a complicated interplay between multiple electron transfer pathways and homogeneous chemical reactions is present, which may not be at equilibrium on the voltametric time scale.
