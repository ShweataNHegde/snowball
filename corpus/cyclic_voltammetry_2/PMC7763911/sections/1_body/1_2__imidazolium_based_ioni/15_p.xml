<p>To enhance their solubility, the investigation of the electrochemical behaviour of the lanthanide(III) ion present in neutral ligand-ionic liquid (NLIL) was performed by cyclic voltammetry. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05812-f006">Figure 6</xref> shows that the there is a two-step reduction observed for Eu
 <sup>3+</sup>, whereas the NLIL containing Nd
 <sup>3+</sup> and Dy
 <sup>3+</sup> underwent a single step 3-electron transfer reduction at the cathodic potential of âˆ’3.0 V. The authors also confirmed that the anodic waves, corresponding to the oxidation of Nd
 <sup>0</sup> or Dy
 <sup>0</sup> to higher oxidation states, were not observed during the performed reversed scans.
