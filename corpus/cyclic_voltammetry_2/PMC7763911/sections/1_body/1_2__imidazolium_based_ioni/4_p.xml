<p>In contrast, copper-, cobalt-, and zinc-bearing systems were highly moisture sensitive. The majority of these metals were reduced at atmospheric pressure and at a scan rate of 100 mV.s
 <sup>−1</sup>. The authors pointed out that the addition of the metal salts to the hydrophobic [bmim][NTf
 <sub>2</sub>] considerably increases the ability of this IL to absorb water from the atmosphere and, therefore, the mild dehydrating experimental conditions employed assured only partial water removal. Therefore, the voltammogram recorded in the “dry” and “wet” system could not be directly compared, leading to a determination of the growth mechanism only in the “wet” systems. The authors concluded that the presence of large amounts of water changed the nature of the coordination species present in the solution, facilitating the electroreduction of the metal centres, and had also effects on the displayed colours of the samples. Nevertheless, metallic deposits were obtained, and their morphologies investigated as a function of the deposition potential and water content. Only in the case of the Ni-bearing IL did the authors report that it didn’t form electroactive species.
