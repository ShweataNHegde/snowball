<p>The search for safer and more sustainable operation conditions has been also pursued in areas such as the mitigation of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (a major driver of climate change) through its transformation into value-added products. In fact, CO
 <sub>2</sub> conversion into valuable chemicals would be the most promising way to reduce CO
 <sub>2</sub> emissions, making it a part of the solution as carbon feedstock. Moreover, such CO
 <sub>2</sub> transformation would preferably occur in conditions that allow to avoid the use of volatile and toxic solvents or catalysts (according to the growing demand for eco-friendly synthetic methodologies), as well as of any supporting electrolyte (for a very easy workup of the reaction mixture).
