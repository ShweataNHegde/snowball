<p>The suitability of room temperature ionic liquids as solvents for redox flow batteries (RFBs) containing metal complexes was investigated by Ejigu et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-25-05812" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], using metal acetylacetonate (acac) complexes [M(acac)
 <sub>3</sub>], (M = Mn, Cr, or V) in imidazolium based RTILs. They detected, by cyclic voltammetry at a glassy carbon electrode, an irreversible behaviour for [Mn(acac)
 <sub>3</sub>] and [Cr(acac)
 <sub>3</sub>] in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide [emim][NTf
 <sub>2</sub>], but the rate of the Mn
 <sup>2+</sup>/Mn
 <sup>3+</sup> reaction increased when Au electrodes were used.
