<p>Huang and collaborators [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-25-05812" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] used the functionalized imidazolium IL 1-hydropropyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, [C
 <sub>3</sub>OHmim][BF
 <sub>4</sub>], for the detection of H
 <sub>2</sub>S. Due to the high absolute values of potential needed to oxidize or reduce H
 <sub>2</sub>S, monoethanolamine (MEA) was added to facilitate its detection (
