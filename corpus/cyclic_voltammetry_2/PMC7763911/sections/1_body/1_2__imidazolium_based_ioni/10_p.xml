<p>The cyclic voltammogram of [bmim][NTf
 <sub>2</sub>], recorded at a glassy carbon working electrode, is shown in the inset of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05812-f003">Figure 3</xref>. The reduction of the [bmim]
 <sup>+</sup> cation occurs at a potential of −2.0 V (vs. Fc/Fc
 <sup>+</sup>), and the oxidation of the [NTf
 <sub>2</sub>]
 <sup>–</sup> anion occurs at 1.0 V (vs. Fc/Fc
 <sup>+</sup>), allowing to detect the reduction of Eu(III) to Eu(II). Photoluminescence spectroscopy confirmed that the symmetry around the europium ions at Eu
 <sup>3+</sup>–DHDECMP in the [bmim][NTf
 <sub>2</sub>] was relatively low. By fluorescence lifetime measurements, the authors also determined that the number of water molecules in the inner sphere is six for non-complexed europium ions, and practically no water molecules was retained in the presence of the complexing extractant DHDECMP.
