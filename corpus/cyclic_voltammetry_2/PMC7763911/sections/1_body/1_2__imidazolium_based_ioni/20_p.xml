<p>Aiming at to accelerate the energy transition (urgent to be adopted in order to reduce anthropogenic causes for climate changes), an intense research is being developed in electrochemical processes of energy conversion and storage, through the design of new materials, namely ionic liquids, which would be able to increase the energetic efficiency of important processes.</p>
