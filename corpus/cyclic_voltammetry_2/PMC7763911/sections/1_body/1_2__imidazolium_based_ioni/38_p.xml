<p>Ratschmeier et al., [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-25-05812" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] studied the CO
 <sub>2</sub> reduction reactions (CO
 <sub>2</sub>RR) at Pt electrodes in four ionic liquids. These electrolytes were 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide, [emim][DCA], [emim][BF
 <sub>4</sub>], [bmim][BF
 <sub>4</sub>], and 1-ocytl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, [omim][BF
 <sub>4</sub>]. It was found that water played an important role in CO
 <sub>2</sub> reduction at a Pt electrode, demonstrating that the formation of an imidazolium carboxylic acid intermediate occurs at electrode potentials of âˆ’0.4 V. The authors also reported evidence of the formation of CO. As a consequence, the presence of CO led to deactivation of the Pt surface and to a decrease in reduction currents.
