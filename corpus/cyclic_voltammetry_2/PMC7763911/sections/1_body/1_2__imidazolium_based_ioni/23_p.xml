<p>In addition, they observed that the use of [bmim][NTf
 <sub>2</sub>] yields almost identical voltammetry to that observed in [[emim][NTf
 <sub>2</sub>], demonstrating that the RTILs anions played the most significant roles in stabilizing the V
 <sup>n+</sup> species. They also discussed the importance of diffusion coefficients. The low diffusion coefficients measured, which shown that [emim][NTf
 <sub>2</sub>] are an order of magnitude lower than in acetonitrile, allied with the relatively high viscosity of RTILs can suggest that the RFBs containing [emim][NTf
 <sub>2</sub>] as the electrolyte could face mass transport issues.
