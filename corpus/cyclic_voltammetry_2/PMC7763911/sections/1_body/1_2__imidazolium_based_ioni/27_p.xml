<p>Recently, the chloroaluminate imidazolium ionic liquid AlCl
 <sub>3</sub>/[emim][Cl] was used to test the performance of titanium dioxide (TiO
 <sub>2</sub>) as electrode in rechargeable aluminum-ion batteries. TiO
 <sub>2</sub> could be a promising electrode material for aluminum-ion battery but it is still quite understudied. Das et al., [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-05812" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] demonstrate the rechargeability of an Al-ion cell with anatase TiO
 <sub>2</sub> as cathode in the chloroaluminate ionic liquid electrolyte. The cell of Al-TiO
 <sub>2</sub> was proven to have an excellent long-term stability. Also, the electroactive nature of TiO
 <sub>2</sub> in the chloroaluminate electrolyte was studied both by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic cycling studies. The authors observed the existence of a synergistic effect of the current collector in improving the long-term stability of Al-TiO
 <sub>2</sub> cell.
