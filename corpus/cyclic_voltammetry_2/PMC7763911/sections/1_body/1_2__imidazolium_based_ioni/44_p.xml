<p>In a completely different research area, the electrochemical behaviour of the nucleobases thymine and thymidine was investigated in [bmim][BF

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05812-f012">Figure 12</xref>. The chronoamperometric fit and the cyclic voltammetry at different scan rates confirmed an irreversible one-electron transfer in both thymine and thymidine.
