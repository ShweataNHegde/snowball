 <sub>2</sub>] exhibited a better performance than [Co(cyclam)Cl
 <sub>3</sub>]. Moreover, the solvent had a major impact on the catalytic performance of the systems: the hydrophilic ionic liquid [bmim][BF
 <sub>4</sub>] promoted the catalytic activity, while [bmim][NTf
 <sub>2</sub>] led to very low values of TON.
