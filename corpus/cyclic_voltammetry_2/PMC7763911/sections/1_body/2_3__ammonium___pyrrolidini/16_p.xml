<p>Girard et al. [
 <xref rid="B72-molecules-25-05812" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], studied the electrochemical performance of trimethyl(isobutyl)phosphonium bisfluorosulfonyl)imide, [P
 <sub>111i4</sub>][NTf
 <sub>2</sub>], by varying the concentration of Li[NTf
 <sub>2</sub>]. The results are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05812-f016">Figure 16</xref>. The voltammograms indicate a quasi-reversible Li depositionâ€“dissolution process. A small shift of the onset potential towards fewer negative values was observed with the increase in lithium-ion concentration in accord with the Nernst equation. The oxidation current densities for the reversible peak decreased significantly with increasing lithium salt concentration as expected from the transport property trends. The authors concluded that the solutions of Li[NTf
 <sub>2</sub>] in the [P
 <sub>111i4</sub>][NTf
 <sub>2</sub>] IL exhibited reasonable transport properties, and therefore could be promising electrolytes for lithium batteries.
