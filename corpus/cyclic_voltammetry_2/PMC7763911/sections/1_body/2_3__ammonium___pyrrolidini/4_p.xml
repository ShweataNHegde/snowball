<p>The ammonium-based ionic liquid tri-n-butylmethylammonium chloride, [N
 <sub>1444</sub>]Cl, was selected by Bhujbal et al. [
 <xref rid="B62-molecules-25-05812" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] to study the electrochemical behaviour of uranyl ion, UO

 <sup>2+</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05812-f014">Figure 14</xref>). An irreversible reduction of U(VI) to U(IV) was observed, resulting in the electrodeposition of uranium oxide (UO
 <sub>2</sub>) over the glassy carbon working electrode.
