<p>Klein et al. [
 <xref rid="B77-molecules-25-05812" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] selected different families of ILs (ammonium, imidazolium and pyrrolidinium) to measure their differential capacitances. Thus, butyl-trimethylammonium bis(trifluoromethyl sulfonyl)imide, [N
 <sub>1114</sub>][NTf
 <sub>2</sub>], ethyl-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, [emim][NTf
 <sub>2</sub>], and methyl-propylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, [Pyr
 <sub>13</sub>][NTf
 <sub>2</sub>], were analysed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) over the entire electrochemical window determined by cyclic voltammetry (with Fc|Fc
