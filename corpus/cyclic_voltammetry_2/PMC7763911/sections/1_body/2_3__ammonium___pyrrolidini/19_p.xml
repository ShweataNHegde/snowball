<p>The redox properties of diethylmethylsulfonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, [S
 <sub>222</sub>][NTf
 <sub>2</sub>], together with different lithium salts were electrochemically characterized by Rangasamy [
 <xref rid="B76-molecules-25-05812" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. The system [S
 <sub>222</sub>][NTf
 <sub>2</sub>]-LiNTf
 <sub>2</sub> appears stable in a wide potential range and exhibits a reversible redox behaviour (
