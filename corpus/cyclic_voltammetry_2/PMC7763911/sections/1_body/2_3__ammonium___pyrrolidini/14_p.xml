<p>Gligor et al. [
 <xref rid="B71-molecules-25-05812" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] prepared and characterized new films based on poly-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT) for nitrite detection on two substrate materials (glassy carbon and gold) and four electrolytes (water, acetonitrile, 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide). The authors observed that the electrodes prepared in ionic liquids led to higher electrocatalytic activity and better sensitivities.
