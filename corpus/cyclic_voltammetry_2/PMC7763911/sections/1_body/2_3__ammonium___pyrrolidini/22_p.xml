<p>In this work, the quaternary ammonium-based IL displayed a different electrochemical potential window and the difference to the previous publications was attributed by the authors [
 <xref rid="B77-molecules-25-05812" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] to a difference in water content, trace impurities, or a difference in current cut off. One of the most important conclusions from this work is related to the factors for the increase in capacitance. It was expected that [N
 <sub>1114</sub>] would display crowding behaviour at the interface while [Pyr
 <sub>13</sub>] and [emim] formed an interface structure with an over-screened surface. These findings support the fact that the bulk measure of molecular interactions, such as viscosity, do not influence the behaviour of the IL at the nanoscale lengths of the electrodeâ€“electrolyte interface.
