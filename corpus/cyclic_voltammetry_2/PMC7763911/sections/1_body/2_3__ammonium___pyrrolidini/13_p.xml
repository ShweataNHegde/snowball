<p>Lahiri et al. [
 <xref rid="B70-molecules-25-05812" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] synthesised germanium-tin alloys with two different ionic liquids, 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium trifluoromethylsulfonate ([Py
 <sub>1,4</sub>]TfO) and 1-butyl-1- methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide ([Py1,4]Tf
 <sub>2</sub>N). The authors performed voltammetric studies of both ionic liquids and conclude that the best ionic liquid to be used as an electrolyte, to prepare Ge
 <sub>1-x</sub>S
 <sub>nx</sub>, is [Py
 <sub>1,4</sub>]TfO. Cyclic voltametric experiments run with the precursors (SnCl
 <sub>2</sub> and GeCl
 <sub>4</sub>) allowed for the detection of a peak associated to the formation of the germanium-tin alloys.
