<p>Arkhipova and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-25-05812" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] employed tetraethylammonium bis (trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, [N
 <sub>2222</sub>][NTf
 <sub>2</sub>], to study the redox properties of mesoporous graphene nanoflakes, showing a capacitance above 100 F/g, while M. Pajaket al. [
 <xref rid="B64-molecules-25-05812" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], have demonstrated that some protic ammonium based ILs with nitrate anion (ethylammonium nitrate and propylammonium nitrate) can act as proton donors in the electrosorption of H
 <sub>2</sub> in palladium. This result is quite relevant because most of the “first generation” ionic liquids were discarded over the years.
