<p>After, a series of pyrrolidinium-based ILs (with different cation chain lengths) bearing the [NTf
 <sub>2</sub>]
 <sup>−</sup> anion has been used for the electrochemical synthesis of 2–3 nm Pt nanoparticles [
 <xref rid="B66-molecules-25-05812" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The electrochemical reduction of [Pt(acac)
 <sub>2</sub>] in the aprotic pyrrolidinium-based ILs, 1-R-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide (R = butyl, hexyl or decyl) was characterized by cyclic voltammetry and suggested that the reduction of [Pt(acac)
 <sub>2</sub>] to metallic platinum occurred through a two-electron transfer process without the formation of any intermediate species.
