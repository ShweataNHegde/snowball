<p>The cathodic peak current density at 100 °C was higher than that at 25 °C, reflecting a decrease in the IL viscosity at 100 °C. Moreover, the disappearance of the anodic current peak at 100 °C was observed and considered to be caused by a chemical reaction of Sm(II) in the ionic liquid. The proportionation and disproportionation equilibrium among Sm, Sm(II), and Sm(III) also led to the formation of Sm nanoparticles in the ionic liquid at 100 °C.</p>
