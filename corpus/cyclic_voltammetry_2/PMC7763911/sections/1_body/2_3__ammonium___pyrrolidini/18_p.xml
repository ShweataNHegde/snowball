<p>Sulfonium-based ILs, namely ferrocenyl-sulfonium ILs were applied by Venkeret et al. [
 <xref rid="B75-molecules-25-05812" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. to investigate the effect of the sulphur atom substituent in redox behaviour of the ionic liquid. They reported that electron withdrawing substituents cause a positive shift of the Fe(II)/Fe(III) ferrocene redox potential (

The study concluded that this class of room temperature ionic liquids might be useful as redox mediators for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), as redox electrolytes in supercapacitors, or as overcharge protection additives in batteries.
