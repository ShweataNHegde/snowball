 <sub>222</sub>][NTf

 <sub>2</sub> ionic liquid electrolyte measured at 60 °C. As reported by the authors, both forward and reverse scan redox peaks have been observed in both cycles. One is the lithium deposition process, and the other is related to the lithium stripping process. The current density of the both the peaks are in the same range indicating that the ionic liquid electrolyte exhibits a good reversible redox behaviour. This more evidence of the potential role that this ionic liquid electrolyte could have as a potential candidate for a “workable” electrolyte to be used in a lithium cell. A wide electrochemical stability window is one of the most desired properties of an “ideal” electrolyte because the chemistry of the two electrode-electrolyte interfaces involved in the battery depends on the properties of the electrolyte. Usually, it is the oxidative stability of the anion that determines the anodic limit of the ILs. Parameters such as being a weak Lewis acid result in weak interactions with the weakly Lewis-acidic organic cations in the liquids, making them have relatively good anodic stability. Because such cations and anions have difficulty to discharge on the electrodes, mainly at lower potentials, the result is a large window of the electrochemical stability.
