<p>Phosphonium cation-based ILs are a readily available family of ionic liquids that, for some applications, offer superior properties as compared to nitrogen cation-based ILs. Recent applications cover their use as extraction and synthetic solvents, as well as in electrochemical processes, such as corrosion protection or electrolytes in batteries and super capacitors. Relevant recent examples follow.</p>
