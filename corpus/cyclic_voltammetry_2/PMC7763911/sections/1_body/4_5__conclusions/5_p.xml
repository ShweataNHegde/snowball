<p>In general, the electrochemical field in ILs is gaining space in chemical, biological, and energy areas, and it deserves to be explored further. The ILs are offering significant advantages over the conventional solvents, but due to the huge number of ILs and parameters to be optimized, more tests should be done.</p>
