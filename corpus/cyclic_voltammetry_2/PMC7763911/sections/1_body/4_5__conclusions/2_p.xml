<p>Over the years, ionic liquids have exhibited excellent properties as electrolytes, not only because of the absence of an organic solvent, but also due to their electrochemical stability, which allow them to be used in a wide electrochemical potential window without being oxidized or reduced. In addition, they allow for the study of the redox behaviour of organic and inorganic compounds by a simple technique such as cyclic voltammetry.</p>
