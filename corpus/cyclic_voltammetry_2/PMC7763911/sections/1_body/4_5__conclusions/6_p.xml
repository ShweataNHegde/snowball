<p>Most of the published work presented in this review are ground-breaking articles, such that now more contributions are required to be able to develop new fields in chemistry. With advances in the science of ionic liquids, there are bound to be some excellent treatments for ionic liquid decomposition. Ionic liquids could be developed to have electrolytes that carry a decomposition switch. Both developments would make ionic liquids more “green” and useful electrolyte materials. The recovery and recycling processes and other surrounding technologies should be developed along with the progress made in the functional design of ionic liquids.</p>
