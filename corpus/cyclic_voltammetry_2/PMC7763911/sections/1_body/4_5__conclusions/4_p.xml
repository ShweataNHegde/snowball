<p>It is expected that the electrochemical characteristics of ionic liquids will continue to find meaningful applications. Several examples were given in the production of new materials or methods. They show physicochemical properties, such as polarity, basicity, acidity, solution temperature, and even reaction step by a colour change. A conductive liquid can transport not only ions but also electrons, microchips, and so on. A liquid battery can be prepared by coating three layers of electrodes and electrolytes.</p>
