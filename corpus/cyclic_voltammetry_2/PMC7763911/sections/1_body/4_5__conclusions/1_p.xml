<p>There are endless combinations of mixed salts that can be designed on demand. Already, novel ionic liquids are being vigorously developed by the scientific community, but the next step should be the fine-tuning of their functionalities, e.g., by mixing two or more ionic liquids. Even with all of the synthetic advances, one of the biggest limitations to the use of RTILs is their cost. Common RTILs remain quite expensive, particularly when compared to conventional organic solvents. For example, the price of one liter of THF is ca. $60, whereas butylmethylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([bmim][BF
 <sub>4</sub>], one of the least expensive RTILs at the moment) is over $2000 per liter [

Several examples presented in this work mention the economic impact or the potential aspects of producing an ionic liquid that could effectively extract, e.g., rare earth elements.
