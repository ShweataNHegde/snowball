<p>The applicable electrochemical potential window of ILs can be determined using well-known electrochemical methods, such as cyclic voltammetry, and is typically found to be similar to or slightly larger than that found in conventional organic solvents, but much larger than that of aqueous electrolytes (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05812-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Imidazolium-based ILs display shorter electrochemical windows than the phosphonium ones indicating a higher electrochemical activity of the formers. In fact, by reduction, imidazolium ion can lead to the formation of N-heterocyclic carbenes [
