<p>Imidazolium-based ILs, such as 1–butyl–3–methyl–imidazolium [bmim] and 1–ethyl–3–methyl–imidazolium [emim], are among the most studied due to their stability within oxidative and reductive conditions, low viscosity, and ease of synthesis [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-05812" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The cationic component of ILs has been varied to include pyridinium, ammonium, phosphonium, thiazolium, and triazolium species [
