<p>Ionic liquids are almost all times composed of organic ions, and therefore have unlimited structural variations in view of the easy preparation of many different components. The tuneability of combinations of cations and anions and the possibility to achieve modifications of the cation and/or the anion part offer access to ionic liquids with targeted properties. This has led to an exponential expansion of the number of multipurpose, interesting ILs known in recent years. Some of the most common ionic liquids components (cations and anions) are presented in
