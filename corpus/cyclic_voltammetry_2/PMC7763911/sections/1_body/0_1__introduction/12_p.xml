<p>Non-aqueous common electrolytes (e.g., tetraethylammonium or triethylmethylammonium tetrafluoroborate salts in acetonitrile) also display very limited potential windows mainly due to the decomposition of the used solvent (e.g., the potential window of commercially available devices based on acetonitrile is 2.7 V [
