<p>Aqueous electrolytes exhibit very high ionic conductivities. However, their electrochemical stability window is very limited (the thermodynamic stability of water, at room temperature, is 1.23 V [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-05812" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]), and therefore are not suitable to use at a wide temperature range or on a very small scale (due to the 100 Â°C boiling point of water) and are usually highly corrosive.
