<p>Working safety is nowadays considered a more important issue than performance, and the delivery of safe and efficient materials for practical uses has been taken into account in the research and development (R&amp;D) efforts. Thus, new features in materials are expected to appear in the immediate future, aiming to boost the transition to greener technologies towards meeting the goals of the 2030 EU Agenda for Sustainable Development [
