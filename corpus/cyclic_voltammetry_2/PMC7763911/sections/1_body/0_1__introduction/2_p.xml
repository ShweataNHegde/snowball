<p>Ionic liquids are (mainly organic) salts exhibiting a very low melting temperature (liquids below 100 °C) and extremely low (negligible) vapor pressure [

Lately, they have received significant attention from the scientific community due to such unusual properties as liquids, being considered as suitable substitutes for volatile organic solvents (VOC, one of the major sources of waste in chemical synthesis) [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-05812" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In fact, due to the unique physicochemical properties of ionic liquids the last decade has seen a remarkable boost on their application in several fields (e.g., chemistry, materials science or chemical engineering) with a significant high number of scientific contributions (ca. 68,057 publications in the period November 2010–2020,
