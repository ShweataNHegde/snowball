<p>For electrochemical usage, the most important properties should be both electroconductivity and ion conductivity [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-05812" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These are essentially the properties of advanced (and safe) electrolyte solutions that are critical to energy devices. For example, currently, electrochemical capacitors are limited in the cell voltage [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-05812" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] due to the degradation of the applied electrolytes, based on organic solvents. Since the storable energy and power are dependent on the square of the cell voltage, it is worth investing in (safer) alternatives to the state-of-the-art electrolytes.
