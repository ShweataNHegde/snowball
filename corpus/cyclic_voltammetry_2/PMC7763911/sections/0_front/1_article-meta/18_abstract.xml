 <p>In this review, the roles of room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) and RTIL based solvent systems as proposed alternatives for conventional organic electrolyte solutions are described. Ionic liquids are introduced as well as the relevant properties for their use in electrochemistry (reduction of ohmic losses), such as diffusive molecular motion and ionic conductivity. We have restricted ourselves to provide a survey on the latest, most representative developments and progress made in the use of ionic liquids as electrolytes, in particular achieved by the cyclic voltammetry technique. Thus, the present review comprises literature from 2015 onward covering the different aspects of RTILs, from the knowledge of these media to the use of their properties for electrochemical processes. Out of the scope of this review are heat transfer applications, medical or biological applications, and multiphasic reactions.</p>
