Human-induced environmental changes have accelerated in the Holocene with the compound, cumulative effects of agriculture (including rice cultivation in Asia from 6.5 ka and on Sulawesi from 3 ka), colonial migration and expanded human settlement (the late 1400 s onwards), industrialisation (1760s onwards), nuclear and thermonuclear testing (1940s on), and today’s persistent greenhouse gas emissions
