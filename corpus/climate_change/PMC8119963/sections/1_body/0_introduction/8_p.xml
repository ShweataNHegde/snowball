<p id="Par9">In an effort to determine why the early rock art of Maros-Pangkep is disappearing so rapidly, we investigated 11 cave art sites in these limestone karsts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), including Leang Timpuseng, which houses the oldest known hand stencil in the world (minimum age of 39.9 ka)

 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). We found ubiquitous evidence for salt efflorescence, including a clear physiochemical distinction between surviving residual case-hardened panel surfaces that house the Late Pleistocene mulberry/red hand stencils and irregularly infilled animal motifs, and fresher surfaces that contain the younger, Austronesian style black drawings (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).
