<p id="Par12">Global warming has already impacted natural and human systems to varying degrees of severity as greenhouse gas emissions raise global temperatures an average of ~ 0.2 °C per decade. Unabated, conservative predictions are for global warming to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial (&gt; 1750) levels within decades (i.e., between 2030 and 2052), with areas of climate sensitivity such as the tropics set to experience up to 3 × higher temperature increases. This trend in higher global temperature accompanies increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events in the mid-latitudes (i.e. the tropics) where hot days have already increased by ~ 3  ͦC

 </sup>. Here we have outlined the increasing deterioration of the Maros-Pangkep rock art assemblage as a consequence of climate change over at least the past four centuries, with apparent rapid acceleration over the past 40 years associated with anthropogenic climate forcing. The challenges facing the preservation of Pleistocene rock art in the tropics are being accelerated by climate change, with urgent action now required. If sustained net zero human CO
 <sup>2</sup> emissions were reached (and non-CO
 <sup>2</sup> reduced elevating radiative forcing) it may still be possible to halt anthropogenic global warming on a multi-decadal timescale
