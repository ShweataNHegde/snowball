<p id="Par10">Salt efflorescence is the growth of salt crystals deposited by saline solution, also known as haloclasty or salt crystallisation. When the solution evaporates, crystals form, expand, and contract as the environment heats and cools, causing repetitive strain. When heated, geological salts such as gypsum, sodium sulphate, sodium carbonate, magnesium sulphate and calcium chloride can expand by three or more times their initial size, while deliquescent salts like sodium chloride dissolve and recrystalise as relative humidity waxes and wanes

 </sup>. Cycles of temperature (especially periodic heat) and humidity induce salt migration, precipitation, crystal growth, hydration, and expansion, triggering mechanical stress on stone surfaces at both the “macro” level (e.g., flaking/exfoliation) and on a “micro”’ scale in the form of granular disintegration. Beginning at the solute/air interface, high relative humidity and/or high ambient temperatures trigger precipitation and evaporation, causing salt crystals to grow, filling pore and void spaces in stone until successive crystallisation pressure generates cracks; crystallisation continues in the form of columns which lift spall flakes, detaching them from the surface
