 </sup>. Here we argue that climate fluctuations over recent millennia and especially in recent decades, have been, and are increasingly, a major catalyst for the deterioration of Pleistocene cave art in Maros-Pangkep, a limestone karst area on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. Uranium-series dating of rock art found in the caves and rock shelters of these near-coastal lowland karsts has demonstrated it is some of the earliest yet known anywhere on the planet, dating to a minimum 45.5 ka and including hand stencils and figurative depictions of animals, human/animal composites (therianthropes), as well as possibly the earliest known narrative scene in prehistoric art

 </sup>. With more than 300 cave/shelter sites in the region known to preserve this Pleistocene style parietal art
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup>, it is clear that the Maros-Pangkep assemblage rivals the celebrated ‘ice age’ cave art of western Europe, where scholars had until recently thought the oldest cave art traditions first emerged. We contend that climate-catalysed salt efflorescence (i.e., haloclasty or salt crystallisation) is responsible for the exfoliation of the older, case-hardened limestone surfaces of Maros-Pangkep’s cave/shelter sites, a process that is widespread throughout older karst cave surfaces in the broader Indonesian region
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup>. Moreover, the exfoliation process, which destroys the rock surfaces or “canvases” on which the Late Pleistocene art was created, appears to have worsened in Maros-Pangkep in recent decades—a trend we believe is set to accelerate with warming ambient temperatures and increasingly frequent/severe El Niño events
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup>. The extent of salt efflorescence in the 11 Maros-Pangkep sites we investigated, coupled with conservative forecasts for a 1.5 to 2 °C raise in global temperatures and accompanying extreme weather events

 </sup>, have grave implications for the conservation of this globally significant cultural heritage. Aside from continuing limestone quarrying for the burgeoning domestic cement and 
 <italic>marmer</italic> (marble) industries, global warming should be regarded as the greatest threat to the preservation of the ancient rock art that survives in Sulawesi and other parts of tropical Indonesia
