<p id="Par14">Portable X-Ray Fluorescence (pXRF) assay locations were selected for features of interest presenting the pXRF aperture to minimise any air gaps and associated X-Ray attenuation. Assay were collected at the height of an El Ni√±o induced drought in late 2015, with strong winds noted in the latter part of the field program. The exceptionally dry conditions were perfect for evaporite deposition and it is likely that the preceding hot, dry climatic period contributed to the ubiquity of geological salts on the cave/shelter surfaces.</p>
