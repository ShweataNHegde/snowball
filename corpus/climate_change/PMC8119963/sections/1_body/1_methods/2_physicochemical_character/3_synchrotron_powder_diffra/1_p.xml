<p id="Par18">Fragments of the spall flakes were crushed into homogenized powders manually using an agate mortar and pestle. Once powdered, they were placed into 0.3-mm-diameter borosilicate capillaries and mounted on the Australian Synchrotron beamline. Diffraction data were collected at the at a wavelength of 0.77412(3) Å, calibrated using a NIST SRM 660b, from 5° to 85° 2Theta, with a Mythen microstrip detector with an inherent step size of 0.002°, using two detector positions and a collection time of 5 min per position. Samples were rotated at around 1 Hz during data collection to ensure good powder averaging. Phase identifications were undertaken using Panalytical Highscore with the ICDD PDF4 database
