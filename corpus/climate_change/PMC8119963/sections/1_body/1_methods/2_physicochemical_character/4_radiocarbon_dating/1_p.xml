<p id="Par19">Black pigment samples were removed from the rock face using a sterile blade, with material collected directly into clean Teflon vials. Pigment from two locations within the same motif, demarcated subsamples LBB 3 (shoulder) and LBB 4 (head) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), were collected in the hope that enough pigment could be harvested to produce two age determinations acting as internal verification for the motif age. Unfortunately, the pigments were thin and only a single target could be generated. The AMS radiocarbon determination was made at the University of Waikato Radiocarbon Dating laboratory (Wk-42768) with the sample washed in hot 10% HCl, rinsed and air dried prior to analysis. Calibration was undertaken using OxCal software (v4.4.2)
