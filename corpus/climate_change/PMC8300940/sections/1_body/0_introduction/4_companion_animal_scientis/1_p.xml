<p>Scientists who study companion animal–human interactions are also well-suited to contribute to conversations regarding climate change. Working toward sustainable climate mitigation and adaptation strategies requires us to engage in whole-systems thinking rather than focus on individual components (

Strengthening the ability for researchers to be “specialized generalists” that are capable of bringing both specialized knowledge of their field as well as a significant capacity to collaborate with other fields is necessary for climate resiliency research (

Companion animal scientists are already “specialized generalists,” with most studying both biological sciences as well as the social aspects of the human–animal relationship. Researchers who study companion animals have backgrounds in many different kinds of disciplines, ranging from animal and veterinary science (e.g., 
 <xref rid="icab025-B151" ref-type="bibr">Van Haaften et al. 2017</xref>), psychology (e.g., 
 <xref rid="icab025-B160" ref-type="bibr">Wynne 2016</xref>), biology (e.g., 
 <xref rid="icab025-B91" ref-type="bibr">Lindblad-Toh et al. 2005</xref>), anthropology (e.g., 
 <xref rid="icab025-B96" ref-type="bibr">MacLean et al. 2017</xref>), public health (e.g., 
 <xref rid="icab025-B13" ref-type="bibr">Bauman et al. 2001</xref>), nursing (e.g., 
 <xref rid="icab025-B11" ref-type="bibr">Banks et al. 2008</xref>), and even archeology and biogeography (e.g., 
 <xref rid="icab025-B86" ref-type="bibr">Larson et al. 2012</xref>), among many others. And many companion animal focused conferences bring together differing disciplines. In fact, companion animal scientists are embracing the One Health and/or One Welfare framework, which recognizes the connection between humans, animals, and the environment (
 <xref rid="icab025-B142" ref-type="bibr">Sykes et al. 2020</xref>). This interdisciplinary and holistic framework identifies that multiple systems are intrinsically linked and interventions must be understood as part of a whole—wherein improving the health/well-being of one of the three facets ultimately improves the others (
 <xref rid="icab025-B116" ref-type="bibr">Pinillos et al. 2016</xref>). As such, companion animal scientists may already be experienced in systems thinking and collaborations across disciplines in their work, positioning them well for incorporating climate change complexities into their research.
