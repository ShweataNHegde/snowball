As such, we encourage not just our fellow scientists, but all companion animal professionals—nonprofit advocacy organizations, government animal service agencies, private rescues, veterinarians, grant makers, dog trainers, pet store owners, educators, groomers, boarders, pet product companies, and anyone else who considers themselves a companion animal advocate—to seize this moment to be better. Incorporate anti-racist policies into every aspect of your work. Ensure that your staff are diverse and representative of your community. Commit to effective education of diversity, inclusion, and equity for all organization members. Examine your policies—written and unwritten—and find areas where you can be more equitable. Doing so is not only morally imperative, but it will undoubtedly serve to increase climate resiliency within our field.
