<p>The stark reality is that our climate is changing and it is affecting every aspect of our lives, including our science, our study populations, and our communities. As scientists and global citizens, we must incorporate climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies into our work, even if we are not in the climate science field. We hope that in a near future, much more research on the relevance of companion animals to climate change will be conducted allowing us to clarify linksâ€”reducing hypothetical assertions and providing clear directions to our communities. We hope that this is the beginning of a new, necessary conversation, and that as a field we can learn and grow together for a more just and resilient future.</p>
