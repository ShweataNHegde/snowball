<p>Whereas previous sections draw links between the outcomes of climate change and its impacts on animals and the human–animal bond, it is also essential to highlight how companion animals, themselves, are contributing to the changing climate. The large estimates of companion animal populations worldwide suggest considerable environmental costs from natural resource use and pollution, most substantially so, from animal food production. Studies of GHG emissions and the ecological pawprint (EPP; a measure of the amount of productive land required) of companion animal food production consistently demonstrate pronounced environmental impacts and use of natural resources (

 <xref rid="icab025-B3" ref-type="bibr">Alexander et al. (2020)</xref> estimate that pet food contributes 1.1–2.9% of global agriculture GHG emissions and ∼1% of global agricultural land use. The EPP and GHG emissions depend on a number of factors including the size and species being fed (larger species typically have a worse environmental impact), the meat sources used, and the energy systems used in food production. Premium cat food was estimated to have 3.3 times higher GHG emissions than market-premium food (

This means that a family who has multiple large dogs who are fed human-grade commercially-bought beef may present the most unsustainable pet ownership practices. In comparison, a family with pet rats, who may eat human leftovers, may present a more sustainable option based on such modeling.
