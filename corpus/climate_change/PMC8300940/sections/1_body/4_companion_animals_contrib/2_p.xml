<p>Aside from feeding companion animals, other owner caretaking behaviors are also likely to have an environmental impact. For example, dog owners may use their personal car to bring their dog for exercise opportunities (e.g., walks in a natural area, dog parks, etc.;

Most animal care products, including food, toys, waste disposal bags, and veterinary medical supplies are composed of single-use plastics. Since 1950, over 7,800 million metric tonnes of plastics have been produced—over half of which occurred since 2004 (

However, the impacts of companion animal care on contributing to plastic pollution is not well studied—albeit with the estimated 99 billion USD pet industry (APPA 2021) in the United States alone, it is likely that pet toys and supplies are probable contributors to waste pollution.
