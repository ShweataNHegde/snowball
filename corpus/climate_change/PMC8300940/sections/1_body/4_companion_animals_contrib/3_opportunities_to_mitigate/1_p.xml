<p>Mitigation interventions to reduce the sources of GHG is an important objective as outlined in the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC (

Human activities are the primary contributors to climate change, and a global focus on mitigating these impacts remains of utmost importance. However, considering the large, growing population of companion animals and their demonstrated environmental impacts, the need to implement mitigation strategies is also clear. “The Three R’s” that guide laboratory animal use in research to reduce animal suffering—replacement, reduction, and refinement (first conceived by

While some presented solutions may have varying feasibility depending on the individual and context, we present proposed solutions considering this replacement, refinement, and reduction framework for developing mitigation strategies. That being said, these suggestions are based on authors’ opinion and would greatly benefit from modeling strategies to identify the maximum reduction in emissions while safeguarding animal health and welfare and retaining benefits to companion animal owners.
