<p>Preserving the health of companion animals in a warming climate involves alterations in both owner behaviors as well as breeding practices. Aside from educating owners on the increased risks of leaving their pets in hot cars, more indirect opportunities may exist to safeguard animals. For example, obesity plays a key role in heat tolerance (
