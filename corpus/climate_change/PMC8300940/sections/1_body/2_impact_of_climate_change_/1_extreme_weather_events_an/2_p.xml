<p>One global impact of climate change is the increased spread of infectious diseases, including vector borne and zoonotic diseases (

While Canada’s southern border was previously the northern extreme of the tick’s geographic range, surveillance of Lyme disease in humans and animals shows that climate warming contributes to the emergence of Lyme disease beyond previously known ranges (
