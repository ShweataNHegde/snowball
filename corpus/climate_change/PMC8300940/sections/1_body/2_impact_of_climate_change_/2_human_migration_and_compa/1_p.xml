<p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns that the most significant single impact of climate change will be in human migration events as humans will outnumber their local environments’ carrying capacities. Typical estimates report that 200 million people are expected to become “climate refugees” by 2050 (nearly 3% of the world population, c.f.

As companion animals go where people go, we can also assume a higher proportion of companion animals will also be migrating with their owners. Long-distance transport is a direct stressor for companion animals. Dogs show behavioral and physiological markers of stress during ground and air transport (

Further, rabies is domestically controlled across many countries, but imported dogs may pose serious risk of introducing foreign variants, which can directly affect human health and cause the establishment of novel canine rabies strains (
