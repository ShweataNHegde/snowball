<p id="p0140">Critical observation of groundnut crop area map developed from satellite imagery (
 <xref rid="f0040" ref-type="graphic">supplementary Fig. 2</xref>.) indicates that groundnut in India is mostly grown in the Ganges, Godavari, Indus, Krishna, Luni, and Tapti FPUs. Baseline and future climate yields and impacts of adaptation options were therefore simulated using the DSSAT model for these FPUs only. The base yields (1980–2009) ranged between 794 and 2737 kg/ha, showing spatial heterogeneity across India. The spatial analysis of yield data across the FPUs (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) showed that the Ganges FPU had the highest yields due to its high rainfall and soil fertility. The Tapti and Godavari FPUs followed next. The lowest yields were observed in the Indus FPU.
