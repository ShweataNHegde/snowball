<p id="p0170">Projected supply, demand and net trade of groundnut in India from 2010 to 2050 under a no climate change scenario are presented in 
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>. Baseline projections (reference scenario - no climate change) indicate a steady increase in demand for groundnut between 2010 and 2050. Production is also projected to increase between 2010 and 2050 but at a slower rate. The supply-demand gap is estimated to narrow down as production is projected to increase, though not at a pace that would be sufficient to cater to the growth in domestic demand. This is likely to turn India from a net exporter in 2010 to a net importer by 2050, without factoring in climate change impacts.
