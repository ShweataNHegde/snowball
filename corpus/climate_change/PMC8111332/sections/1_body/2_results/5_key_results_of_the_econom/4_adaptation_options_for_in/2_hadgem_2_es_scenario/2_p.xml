<p id="p0185">Groundnut yields increased under all adaptation options. To the greatest extent, under the adaptation scenario in which, higher-yielding cultivars were clubbed with critical irrigation in all FPUs in 2050 compared to baseline under the HadGEM 2-ES scenario. Yield increases ranged between 6% in the Ganges basin to 38% in the Krishna basin. Adopting high-yielding cultivars alone is projected to increase yields in all the basins but to a lesser extent, ranging between 6% in the Ganges basin and 27% in the Godavari basin compared to baseline. Providing one critical irrigation is also projected to increase yields in all FPUs in 2050, except in the Ganges basin under the HadGEM 2-ES scenario. However, the projected increase is low in both the adaptation options and ranges between 6% to 26% in the Tapti and Krishna basins, respectively (
