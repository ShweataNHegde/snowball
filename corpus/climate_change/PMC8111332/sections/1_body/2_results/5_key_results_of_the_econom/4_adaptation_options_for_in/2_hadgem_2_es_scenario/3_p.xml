<p id="p0190">Groundnut production under the HadGEM 2-ES scenario is higher under all adaptation options. To the greatest extent under the adaptation scenario in which higher yielding cultivars are used combination with critical irrigation in all FPUs compared to the baseline scenario. The increases in production range between 9% in the Ganges basin to 66% in the Krishna basin in 2050 compared to baseline. Using high yielding cultivars is also projected to increase production in all the basins in 2050 but to a lesser extent, ranging between 9% in the Ganges basin to 46% in the Godavari basin. Similarly, one irrigation during crop growth period projected to result in increased yields in all FPUs except for the Ganges basin in 2050 under the HadGEM 2-ES scenario. The magnitude of increase is projected to be lesser than the other adaptation options and ranges between 10% in the Tapti basin to 44% in the Krishna basin (
