<p id="p0200">Groundnut production in India was higher under all adaptation options in all the FPUs with the exception of the Ganges and Indus basins in 2050 under the GFDL-ESM2M scenario. The increase in production ranged between 18% in the Tapti basin and 39% in the Krishna basin compared to baseline in 2050. Adopting to higher yielding cultivars is projected to increase production in all the basins, but at a lower extent ranging between 8% in the Tapti basin and 19% in the Godavari basin compared to baseline. Providing one irrigation is also projected to result in increased yields in all the FPUs except for the Ganges basin compared to baseline. The scale of increase is projected to be lesser than both the other adaptation options and ranges between 6% in the Tapti basin and 24% in the Krishna basin (
