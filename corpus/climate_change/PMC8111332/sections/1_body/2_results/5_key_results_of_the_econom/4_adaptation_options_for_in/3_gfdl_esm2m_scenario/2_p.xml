<p id="p0195">Groundnut yields increased under all adaptation options. The highest increase is in the option of combining high yielding cultivars with critical irrigation in all FPUs compared to baseline in 2050, under the GFDL-ESM2M scenario, similar to the HadGEM 2-ES scenario. The increase ranged between 11% in the Tapti basin to 23% in the Krishna basin, which had the lowest average yield compared to all other FPUs. Adopting high yielding cultivars is projected to result in increased yields in all the basins except the Ganges and Indus basins but to a lesser extent, ranging between 5% in the Tapti basin and 11% in the Godavari basin compared to baseline. The application of critical irrigation during the pod filling stage for groundnut grown under rainfed conditions is projected to result in increased yields in all FPUs except for the Ganges and Indus basins compared in 2050. The increase is projected to be lesser than both the other adaptation options and ranges between 3% in the Tapti basin and 15% in the Krishna basin. None of the adaptation options are estimated to improve yields than baseline in 2050 in the Ganges and Indus basins (
