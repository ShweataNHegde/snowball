<p id="p0205">Changes in groundnut production in India lead to price fluctuations. All the adaptation scenarios allow producers to capture a greater share of the final consumer price. This leads to a situation where producer prices in India increase by between one to 3% under the GFDL-ESM2M scenario and by between four to 7% compared to baseline prices by 2050. This is seen as a natural consequence of adaptation and a decline in the global price of groundnut between 0.4% and 0.8% under the GFDL-ESM2M scenario and between 1.2% and 2% under the HadGEM 2-ES scenario compared to the baseline by 2050 (
