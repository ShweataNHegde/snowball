<p id="p0180">Total annual groundnut production under the baseline scenario is between 23 metric tons (MT) and 354 MT in 2050 across various Indian FPUs Under the HadGEM 2-ES scenario, groundnut production is projected to be higher than the baseline in all FPUs (6.1 to 16.1%), except the Ganges basin (−0.6%) in 2050. Similarly, under the GFDL-ESM2M scenario, production is projected to fall in the Ganges (−11.6%), Indus (−10.5%) and Tapti (−1.3%) FPUs and increase in all other FPUs compared to the baseline in 2050 (
