<p id="p0155">We tested incorporating yield boosting genetic traits by increasing maximum leaf photosynthesis rate, partitioning daily growth to pods, and seed filling duration compared with the baseline cultivar (JL24) as an adaptation option. Incorporating these traits in JL-24 resulted in increased yields under both the GCMs. However, the response was more significant under HadGEM 2-ES in five out of six FPUs. The average yield benefit with yield boosting cultivars under both GCMs across FPUs were 17.1 and 18.1% with GFDL-ESM2M and HadGEM 2-ES respectively (Supplementary Table 1).</p>
