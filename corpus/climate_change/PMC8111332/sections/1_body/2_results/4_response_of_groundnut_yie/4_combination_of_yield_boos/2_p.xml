<p id="p0165">As the simulation study clearly showed spatially different responses with yield boost and critical irrigation, we tried a simulation of combining both CI and YB using future climate data. The responses were very encouraging across FPUs. The highest response to the combination was observed in the Krishna basin under both the GCMs, with responses ranging between 27% and 54.2% under GFDL-ESM2M and 19.6% and 44.9% with HadGEM 2-ES GCMs (supplementary Table 1). The spatial distribution of yield benefits under various adaptation options across groundnut growing regions are depicted in 
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. Regional aggregation of data indicates that southern India regions experience the highest benefits due to the adoption of both critical irrigation and yield boost cultivars. Further, the response to yield boost cultivar was mostly uniform spatially across locations. However, the response to agronomic management was very prominent in the Krishna basin where the highest area of groundnut was cultivated (
