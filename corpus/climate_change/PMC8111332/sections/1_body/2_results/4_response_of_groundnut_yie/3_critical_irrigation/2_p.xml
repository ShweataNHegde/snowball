<p id="p0160">Groundnut in India is grown under rainfed conditions in most of the groundnut growing areas. However, most of the time, the crop may experience dry spells during pod filling. Providing one critical irrigation under these conditions will be beneficial for crop growth. We tried applying one critical irrigation at 60 DAS as an adaptation option. This resulted in increases in yield under both GCMs and in all the FPUs. However, the response was spatially different across different FPUs. Yield gains from critical irrigation were 24.9% and 34.8% under HadGEM 2-ES and GFDL-ESM2M, respectively in the Krishna basin (supplementary Table 1). The responses were lowest in the Ganges and Luni basins under HadGEM 2-ES. Luni basin was lowest under both HadGEM 2-ES and GFDL-ESM2M GCMs. This underlines the need for location-specific adaptation options.</p>
