<p id="p0150">We used two GCMs, one optimistic (HadGEM 2-ES) and another pessimistic (GFDL-ESM2M) to study the impact of climate change on groundnut yields under RCP 8.5 during the mid-century period. The summary of the projected percentage change in groundnut yields between the baseline (1980–2009) and the mid-century future climate (2040–2069) are presented in 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Under climate change, groundnut yields showed a declining trend with the GFDL-ESM2M scenario, and an increasing trend with the HadGEM 2-ES GCMs in a majority of groundnut growing FPUs. Climate change impacts were more prevalent in the Ganges and Indus basins than other FPUs. The yield penalty under pessimistic GCM were as high as −33.7% in the Ganges basin, with overall yields ranging between −33.7% and 12.2% compared to the baseline. Under optimistic GCM, yield improvements were as high as 43.2% in the Godavari FPU and ranged between −2.3 and 43.2%.
