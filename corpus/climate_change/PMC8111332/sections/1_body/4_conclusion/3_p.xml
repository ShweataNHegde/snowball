<p id="p0270">This study provides the first robust and comprehensive analysis based evidence that climate change impacts in a country like India have an impact on global prices, production and yields. Finally, it also helps international and national donors and policymakers to make informed decision-making. It encourages the public and private sectors to invest in climate change adaptation strategies in order to reduce the negative impacts of changing climate on agricultural food systems, build resilience and enhance smallholder farmers' income levels in developing countries where agriculture is the main source of livelihood.</p>
