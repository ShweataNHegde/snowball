<p id="p0265">Our analysis combining biophysical and economic models facilitated the estimation of impacts of different groundnut adaptation options to offset climate change impacts. The integrated assessment could guide policymakers to better understand the consequences of targeted actions in their priority setting exercises. The results clearly indicate the spatial and temporal variations in groundnut yields and production under climate change in India's groundnut growing regions and underscore the need for carefully targeted adaptation responses.</p>
