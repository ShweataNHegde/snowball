<p id="p0040">However, there is very little evidence so far to show how climate change and variability over the next few decades will impact groundnut productivity and production in a particular country and its impact on price and net trade globally. It is also essential to understand if one major groundnut producing country plans to adopt adaptation measures and if the measures have an impact on groundnut prices locally and globally. While researchers have quantified the impacts of climate change on several crops and regions, most of the studies have focused on assessing biophysical impacts without considering economic factors and future pathways. Therefore, it is critical to understand how climate change impacts will influence developing countries adaptation and mitigation measures and assess the impacts on crop production and prices.</p>
