<p id="p0030">Groundnut (
 <italic>Arachis hypogaea L</italic>.) is an important food and oilseed crop grown in India across varying agro-climatic environments. It is mostly grown (83% of total groundnut area) under rainfed conditions during the monsoon season (June/July to October/November) and the remaining 17% is grown under irrigated conditions in the post-monsoon (October–March) season (
