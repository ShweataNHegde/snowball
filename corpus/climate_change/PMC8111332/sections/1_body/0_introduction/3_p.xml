<p id="p0025">Indian agriculture faces a serious threat from climate change that may lead to severe challenges in ensuring food security for its growing population. Climate change impacts are expected to reduce food production, leading to higher food prices, reduced consumption and increased number of people with malnourishment and hunger (

Several researchers have studied the impacts of climate change on various crops and their productivity using different methodological approaches. They have used either process-based biophysical models or economic and statistical models (
