<p id="p0035">Recent studies using crop simulation models to examine groundnut yields in 2050 report as much as a 25% decrease in yields compared to 2010 (

However, these results were obtained without considering technological changes and impacts of long-run drivers such as growth in incomes, area, production and crop yields. Over the years, new crop technologies may have been adopted by farmers in response to changes in population, income, in addition to climate. These factors should be considered while assessing impacts of climate change on various crops and cropping systems as they have a significant effect on consumption and expenditure on food commodities. Globally, by 2050 yields of major crops such as maize, rice, wheat, and soybean will be around 11% lower due to the effects of climate change combined with economic responses. When compared with climate alone, the yield decline will be 25% (
