<p id="p0085">Biophysical crop simulation models usually require profile-wise soil data. For each grid cell, we obtained soil inputs from a set of 90 soil profiles developed by blending and interpreting information from crop modeling studies conducted in India in various locations and from the World Inventory of Soil Emission Potentials (WISE) database (

 <xref rid="f0035" ref-type="graphic">supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). We ran crop model simulations for all soils in each grid cell and computed cell-specific output from the area-weighted average based on the area share of each soil in the grid cell. Instead of using available broad generic soil database, we made an effort to collect soil profile data from International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) data repository which were checked for quality and were specific to groundnut growing regions. We derived soil physical and chemical properties such as texture, hydraulic parameters, bulk density, organic matter and available N for each location based on the available soil profile data. Additional soil parameters such as soil albedo, drainage constant, and runoff curve number were estimated based on soil texture and converted using the generic soil database available in the DSSAT-models (
