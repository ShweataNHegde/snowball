<p id="p0080">Among the two GCMs, HadGEM2-ES is the driest (
 <xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Wiebe et al., 2015</xref>) and was therefore selected because groundnut is mostly grown under rainfed conditions and is sensitive to water stress. In this paper we focused on the RCP 8.5 scenario. Both the GCMs result in higher temperature and rainfall anomalies compared to RCP 6.0 and 4.5 with lower global greenhouse gas emissions (
 <xref rid="bb0340" ref-type="bibr">Warszawski et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, we used GFDL-ESM2M to investigate the wettest scenario for climate change in the groundnut. RCP 8.5 scenario is treated as a possible scenario if society does not make concerted efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The reason behind selecting two forceful scenarios like RCP8.5 is, that it represents the pessimistic scenario and with adaptations towards this outcome, the agricultural sector will be well prepared to adjust to conditions likely under less forcing scenarios.
