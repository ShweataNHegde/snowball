<p id="p0100">We developed virtual cultivars with desirable yield improving plant traits by changing crop life cycle and yield potential traits (

Genetic coefficients determining the maximum leaf photosynthesis rate (LFMAX), maximum fraction of daily growth partitioned to pod (XFRT) and seed-filling duration for pod cohort (SFDUR) of cultivars were increased by 10%. We tried agronomic management options (critical irrigation at 60 DAS) as an adaptation strategy to combat climate change impacts on groundnut production in India. The reason for increasing the capacity of both source (LFMAX) and sink (XFRT and SFDUR) in groundnut was that there was sufficient genetic variation in photosynthesis rate, harvest index and partition intensity. We observed that these factors have a positive association with total sink size and pod yield (
 <xref rid="bb0345" ref-type="bibr">Nautiyal et al., 2012</xref>). Due to non-senescence nature of groundnut we observed higher yields with increased LFMAX during the development of virtual cultivars. We used 60 mm of irrigation at 60 days after sowing which coincided with the pod development stage. The reason for using 60 mm irrigation depth was based on farmer's feedback during stakeholder consultation meeting.
