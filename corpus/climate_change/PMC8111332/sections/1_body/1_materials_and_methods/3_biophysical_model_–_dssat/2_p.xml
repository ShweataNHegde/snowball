<p id="p0065">The CROPGRO-groundnut model was used to evaluate climate change impacts and adaptation options such as agronomic and improved genetic traits of groundnut for increasing its productivity under both current and future climates in the target sites. The CROPGRO-groundnut model is part of a suite of crop models available in decision support system for agrotechnology transfer (DSSAT) version 4.5 software (
