<p id="p0115">The model uses crop area, prices, and productivity growth (intrinsic productivity growth rates (IPR's)) to determine the supply of 62 food commodities. The IPRs, which are crop and country-specific, summarize the potential improvements over years in agricultural productivity that can come from advances in management practices, crop improvement and agricultural extension. We used elasticity estimates from country-level studies to establish the relationship between supply, demand and price of each commodity in the model. In case of missing elasticity estimates, we used approximations based on values from similar neighboring countries in the region.</p>
