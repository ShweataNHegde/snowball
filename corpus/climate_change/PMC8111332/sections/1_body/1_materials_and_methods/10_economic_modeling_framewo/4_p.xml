<p id="p0120">In the IMPACT modeling framework, the partial equilibrium economic trade model, which simulates national and international markets, is linked with other models like the water (hydrology, water basin management and water stress models), crop system model (DSSAT), climate models (General Circulation Models (GCMs)), value chain and land-use model. The model equates supply and demand across the globe to determine the world price of individual commodity. It integrates information flows among the component modules in a consistent equilibrium framework that supports longer-term scenario analysis (

The outputs from crop and hydrology models are used as input into IMPACT as yield drivers to project crop production, demand, trade, among others at global, regional and national scales. The climate and technology-induced crop yield shocks were used as inputs in the agriculture sector economic model (

At each country level, the gap between demand and supply is resolved through international trade, leaving countries as either net importers/exporters. The wedge/difference between the country and world price reflects the effect of market margin and trade policies.
