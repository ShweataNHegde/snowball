<p id="p0130">These models together help in understanding the market effects of crop production and its response to climate change. This is accomplished by incorporating climate change effects into the crop yield response to the economic model. Using this suite of models, we assessed the impact of climate change on major groundnut growing regions in India, referred to as FPUs in IMPACT terminology. The IMPACT model takes into account 13 FPUs in India which correspond to the major river basins. Since this study is on groundnut, the study focused on the major groundnut producing basins in India, Ganges, Godavari, Indus, Krishna, Luni, and Tapti.</p>
