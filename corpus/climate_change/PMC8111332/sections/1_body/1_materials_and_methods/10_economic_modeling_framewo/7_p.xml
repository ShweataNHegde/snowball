<p id="p0135">The economic model links crop yields and changes in output prices endogenously. The model assumes that farmers will respond to changes in prices by varying the use of inputs, such as fertilizer, chemicals, and labor, which will have an impact on the yield. Over the years, if the price of a crop declines, farmers have less incentive to allocate resources to that crop, resulting in a decline in crop yields. The biophysical models involve technology and climate and are therefore independent of prices, and these represent “non market” effects. The economic model captures the markets and prices, which are denoted as “market” effects.</p>
