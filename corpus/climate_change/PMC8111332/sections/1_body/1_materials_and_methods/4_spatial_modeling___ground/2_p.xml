<p id="p0070">The terra moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation indices (MOD13Q1) version 5 data are generated every 16Â days. Imagery was acquired from the Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC) (

Image classification was performed by rescaling 16-day normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images and later stacking them into a single data composite for each cropping year (

An NDVI 16-day composite was used for identifying and labelling land use/land cover classes, including groundnut areas in India. Class identification and labelling were done based on decision tree algorithms, and spectral matching techniques along with intensive ground survey data.
