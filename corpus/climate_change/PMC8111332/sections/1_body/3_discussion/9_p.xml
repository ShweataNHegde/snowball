<p id="p0255">Ceteris paribus, increased production reduces price and decreased production increase the price. In this study, under optimistic scenario, the increase in groundnut yield and production decrease the prices due to market effects. Optimistic scenario positively impacts groundnut yields with market effects but lower than the non-market effect. Under pessimistic climate scenario, the decrease in groundnut yields and production in India leads to increase in groundnut price. So, the increase price provide incentive to the farmers to increase farm inputs which dampens the negative impacts on groundnut yields.</p>
