<p id="p0220">In the current study, we chose two extreme climate change scenarios - one driest and another wettest to test the performance of various cultivars and management related adaptation options. This allowed us to observe the impacts of both pessimistic and optimistic climate scenarios. To reduce the negative impacts of climate change and to take the advantage of positive impacts, we identified several adaptation options based on in-depth literature reviews and consultations with scientists and experts in traditional management practices, modern farm applications, and new crop cultivars. We used crop simulation models to forecast crop growth and yield advantages due to new technologies in different FPUs. The models provide an opportunity to understand the impact of modifying various cultivar traits within the observed limits of their genetic variability and to assess the potential benefit of incorporating such traits (
