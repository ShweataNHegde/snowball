<p id="p0235">Further in majority of locations in India, groundnut is grown under rainfed conditions during monsoon season. Whenever a dry spell occurs, crop is exposed to drought conditions during the growth period. Drought conditions affect leaf expansion, photosynthesis and pod filling period which in turn affect shelling percentage (

In addition, earlier studies also showed that with better root structure such as increased root length density, drought tolerant cultivars extract more water from increasing soil depth (
