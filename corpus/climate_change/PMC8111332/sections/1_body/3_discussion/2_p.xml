<p id="p0215">In this study we assessed (1) the potential impact of climate change on groundnut production in India during 2050 and an adaptation scenario where we tried different irrigation and varietal management options (2) we also combined climate and crop models with economic models to examine the impact of climate change not only on agricultural production but also on area, production, consumption and prices of groundnut. The uniqueness of this study lies in its efforts to link process-based crop simulation models with economic models to understand climate change complexities. By linking various socioeconomic scenarios that represent key drivers of future change, such as gross domestic product (GDP), population, and market effects, we undertook an
