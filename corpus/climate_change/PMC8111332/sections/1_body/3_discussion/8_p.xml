When market effects are also taken into consideration, prices and trade interact with agricultural productivity worldwide, producing what are defined as endogenous yields (

Over time the elasticities are adjusted to accommodate the gradual shift in demand from staples to high-value commodities like meat, especially in developing countries. This assumption is based on expected economic growth, increased urbanization, and continued commercialization of the agricultural sector.
