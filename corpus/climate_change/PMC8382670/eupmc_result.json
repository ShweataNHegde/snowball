Sensitivity patterns of these ecosystem services vary largely. For CS, more than half of the pixels showed a positive sensitivity to climate change, even though the degree of sensitivity is not high. There is substantial spatial heterogeneity in the exposure of ecosystem services to future climate changes, and high levels of future climate change increase the intensity of exposure. <h4>Conclusions</h4> This study illustrates the complex spatial association between ecosystem services and climatic drivers, and these findings can help optimize local response strategies in the context of global warming. For example, the existing protected areas have notable conservation gaps for disturbance of future climate change on ecosystem services, especially in the southeastern part of the study area. <h4>Supplementary Information</h4> The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10980-021-01320-9.", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Undetermined", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Climate change", "Exposure", "Sensitivity", "Tibetan Plateau", "ecosystem services"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Free", "availabilityCode": "F", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "PubMedCentral", "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8382670/?tool=EBI"}, {"availability": "Free", "availabilityCode": "F", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "PubMedCentral", "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8382670/pdf/?tool=EBI"}, {"availability": "Free", "availabilityCode": "F", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8382670"}, {"availability": "Free", "availabilityCode": "F", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8382670?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "N", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2021-08-26", "firstIndexDate": "2021-08-26", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2021-08-26", "dateOfRevision": "2021-08-27", "electronicPublicationDate": "2021-08-24", "firstPublicationDate": "2021-08-24"}, "abstract": "<h4>Context</h4> Climate change has imposed tremendous impacts on ecosystem services.
