  <p>Relationship of ecosystem services’ sensitivity to climate change. The first row is the relationship between the single ecosystem service (
   <bold>a</bold>: CS; 
   <bold>b</bold>: WR; 
   <bold>c</bold>: HQ) and two climate drivers (precipitation and temperature). The second and third row is the relationship between the two ecosystem services and a single climate driver (precipitation or temperature). The numbers inside and outside the box represent the area proportion (%) and the correlation coefficient of pixels in this state. All correlation coefficients pass the significance test (p &lt; 0.05). See Fig.
