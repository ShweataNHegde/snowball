  <p>Exposure of ecosystem services to climate change. The first column is the exposure of ecosystem services (CS, WR, and HQ) to climate change (precipitation and temperature) under SSP1-2.6. The second, third column is the positive and negative exposure of ecosystems to climate change along the altitude gradient under four climate scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5), respectively. Different colours represent different climate scenarios, and the rectangular box in the figure is a close-up of local features of exposure. And Figs. S9 and S14 showed climate velocity and standard error estimate of climate velocity under four climatic scenarios</p>
