<p id="Par9">Increasing the understanding of ecosystem services’ relationships contributes to achieving better ecosystem management that increases synergies and mitigates the trade-offs (Qiu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2018</xref>; Zheng et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2019</xref>). Understanding the trade-offs between ecosystem climate drivers is crucial for effective management as well. Multiple driving forces often inhibit each other’s impact on ecosystem services. At the same time, ecosystem services’ drivers may influence a single ecosystem service, but have limited effects on other services, or dramatically change multiple services (Bennett et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2009</xref>; Nelson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2013</xref>). Therefore, identifying the trade-offs and synergies among the ecosystem services’ climatic drivers is essential.
