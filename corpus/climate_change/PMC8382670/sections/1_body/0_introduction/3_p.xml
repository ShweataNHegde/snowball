<p id="Par8">Several works specifically focused on the effects of climate change on ecosystem services. However, most of the works focused on the impacts of climate change on ecosystem services, just for a few snapshots (Qiu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2020</xref>). Considering that climate fluctuations take a long period to be stabilized, the study with short-term periods may limit their value. Besides, most of the studies had a coarse scale (e.g., basin or larger), and only a few had a finer resolution (e.g., pixel scale) (Hao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2017a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">b</xref>; Hou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2020</xref>; Shen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2020</xref>). Coarse-scale studies overlook important information that may be essential for management. Thus, it is necessary to conduct detailed and high-resolution studies, essential to disentangle service-dependent and identify climate change impacts (Cord et al.
