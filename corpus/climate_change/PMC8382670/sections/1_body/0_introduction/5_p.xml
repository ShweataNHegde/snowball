<p id="Par10">The Tibetan Plateau is an area that supplies a wide range of important ecosystem services (Sun et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2012</xref>; Liu 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2020</xref>), and it is one of the most sensitive areas to global climate change (Song et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2014</xref>; Kuang and Jiao 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2016</xref>). Long-term overgrazing, combined with very harsh climate conditions, increased the vulnerability of ecosystem services supply to climate change (Newbold et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2015</xref>; Lehnert et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2016</xref>). The future value of ecosystem services is highly uncertain under different climate scenarios (Kubiszewski et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2017</xref>) and depends on policy choices. In this context, it is of utmost importance to assess the impacts of future climate change on ecosystem services and develop ecological-oriented regional management policies.
