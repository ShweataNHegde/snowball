<p id="Par11">This work aims to analyze the sensitivity of ecosystem services to historical climate change and infer future exposure of ecosystem services to climate change on the Tibetan Plateau. In particular, the objectives of the research are: (1) to measure the spatial patterns and trends of primary ecosystem services [i.e., carbon sequestration (CS), water retention (WR), and habitat quality (HQ)]; (2) to quantify the sensitivity of these ecosystem services to climate change (precipitation and temperature) at pixel scale; (3) to identify the spatial association between the ecosystem services and their climatic drivers, and (4) to investigate the exposure of ecosystem services under multiple future climate scenarios.</p>
