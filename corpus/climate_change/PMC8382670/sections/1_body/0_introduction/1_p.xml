<p id="Par6">Ecosystem services are defined as benefits that humans obtain from the ecosystems (Costanza et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1997</xref>) and are key to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (McElwee et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2020</xref>; Yang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2020</xref>). Climate change affects ecosystems’ structure, composition, function, and the supply of ecosystem services (Holmgren and Hirota 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2013</xref>; Grimm et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2013</xref>). Several works explored climate change’s influence on ecosystem services and put forward adaptive management strategies (Tanner-McAllister et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2017</xref>; Langhans et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2019</xref>). There are numerous pieces of evidence that climate change induces great disturbances in regulating and provisioning services (IPCC et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2019</xref>). The global mean temperature is expected to rise by 1–5 °C by the end of the twenty-first century, depending on future emission trajectories (IPCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2018</xref>; Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2019</xref>) and the warming trend are generally expected to intensify the negative impacts on ecosystem services, especially in vulnerable areas (Westerling et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2011</xref>; Seidl et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2014</xref>). Therefore, it is vital to increase our understanding of the spatial association between ecosystem services and climate change. This is key to identify ecosystem services’ exposure to future climate changes and to prevent the decline of ecosystem services under a changing climate.
