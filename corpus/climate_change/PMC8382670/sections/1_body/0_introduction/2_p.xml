<p id="Par7">Previous works highlighted that the effects of climate change on ecosystem services are service-dependent and spatially explicit. Climate change impacts can have diverse effects in different regions due to different ecological, hydrological, and biophysical processes (Qiu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2019</xref>). For instance, warming may benefit vegetation distribution and productivity by boosting photosynthesis and plant growth rates (Sullivan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2008</xref>). However, this increases evaporation and soil organic matter decline (Schroter et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2005</xref>). Therefore, the increasing temperature may positively affect forest productivity and bioenergy production; nevertheless, it may have adverse impacts on water supply and soil fertility (Schroter et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2020</xref>).
