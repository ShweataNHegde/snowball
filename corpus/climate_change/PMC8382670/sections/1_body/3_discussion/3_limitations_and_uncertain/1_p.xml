<p id="Par51">There are several limitations in the analysis. Data with different resolutions were used, especially the resolution of future scenario climate (2.5 min) is quite different from other datasets (500/1000 m). These problems and limitations were identified in previous works (e.g., Gomes et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2021</xref>). This study quantified ecosystem services’ sensitivity to historical climate change and inferred the possible future exposure combined with future scenario data. Climate models are highly uncertain (e.g., Wootten et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2017</xref>) and the projection of their impacts on ecosystem services may inherit these of uncertainties. To minimize this, we used an average of 8 different future climate models to reduce the errors and increase the robustness of the work. Although we assessed the potential impact of future climate change on ecosystem services, we have not performed future ecosystem service simulations. For this, we consider that the simulation of ecosystem services often requires robust data and simulations. Some recent studies also confirmed our concerns (Shi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2018</xref>; Ploton et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2020</xref>). Furthermore, there is a slight inconsistency in the period involved in the ecosystem services’ evaluation and sensitivity calculation due to the data availability (e.g., CS and WR are 2000–2015 and 2001–2014, respectively). The above process may cause some uncertainty.
