<p id="Par56">Different emission scenarios will also cause varying degrees of climate disturbance to ecosystem services (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). We found that a high-emission scenario (i.e., SSP5-8.5) indicates a higher intensity of exposure, regardless of positive or negative (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). The intensity of exposure under SSP5-8.5 scenarios is close to 1.5 times higher than the baseline (SSP1-2.6) in most altitude ranges. The increase of carbon dioxide emissions, temperature, and precipitation in high-emission scenarios tend to promote part ecosystem services such as CS and WR. Therefore, high-emission scenarios do not necessarily lead to severe degradation of ecosystem services. For example, Fan et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>) found that soil conservation service and carbon fixation service on the Tibetan Plateau will decline under low-emission scenarios, while high-emission scenarios can bring about the highest ecosystem services’ sustainability. Our analysis also confirmed that, for CS and HQ, the number of pixels negatively affected by the climate is slightly reduced under high-emission scenarios (Fig. S13). However, considering other potential negative effects (e.g., ecosystems disruption) under high carbon emission scenarios, determining the optimal climatic pathway still needs to be treated with caution. Overall, understanding the impacts of climate change on ecosystem services is vital to achieve sustainable development goals (Pereira
