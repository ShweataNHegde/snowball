<p id="Par54">According to the definition, exposure is a simplified indicator to quantify the response of ecosystem services to future climate change. It captures potential climate disturbance intuitively and indicate the specific need for climate change adaptation planning. We found a certain similarity between the exposure pattern and the sensitivity pattern (Figs.
