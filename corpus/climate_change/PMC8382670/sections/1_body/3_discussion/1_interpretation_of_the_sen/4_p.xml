<p id="Par46">Climate change influences HQ by shifting plant distribution, phenology, biological events, food availability timing, and landscape connectivity (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2011</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2018</xref>; Guo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2015</xref>). The impact of climate change is particularly evident in mountainous areas (Kelly and Goulden 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2008</xref>). This is consistent with the results observed in the Hengduan Mountains. Frequent human activities and the ecological engineering measures mentioned can weaken or strengthen resistance to climate change, making the sensitivityâ€™s direction of ecosystem services to climate change heterogeneous.
