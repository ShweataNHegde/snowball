<p id="Par43">Climate change may have positive effects on some ecosystem services and negative in others. The magnitude of influence is very heterogeneous and dependent on the region and ecosystem services types (Mina et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2017</xref>). Understanding the direction and magnitude of climate change allows human communities to anticipate the impacts of climate change better and adapt if necessary (Weiskopf et al.
