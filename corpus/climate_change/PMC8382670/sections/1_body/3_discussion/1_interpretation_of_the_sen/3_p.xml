<p id="Par45">The change in the direction of WR is primarily determined by the precipitation, as confirmed by the results (Fig.

WR of Xigaze, Sannan, and Nyingchi showed a negative sensitivity to temperature, whereas precipitation and WR exhibited a decreasing trend and temperature an increasing one. WR showed a positive sensitivity to Golog, Aba, and Yushu’s temperature, where WR, precipitation, and temperature all exhibit an increasing trend. On the other hand, the temperatures will not necessarily lead to an increase in evapotranspiration, according to the “evaporation paradox” (Brutsaert and Parlange
