<p id="Par47">Temperature and precipitation may mutually weaken or jointly promote the same ecosystem services supply. In 27.78% of the regions, precipitation and temperature have a coordinated effect on CS, where the trends of CS, temperature, and precipitation are similar. According to the impact of climate change on CS, the influencing direction of temperature and precipitation on CS is the same. However, in most regions (47.45%), temperature and precipitation trends have an antagonist effect on CS. Among them, 29.95% of the regions showed that the trend of CS is consistent with the precipitation trend but different from the observed temperature trend, mainly in Nagqu. In this region, the gains from warming cannot offset the loss caused by the precipitation decrease. When temperature and precipitation have an antagonist relation, the CS direction in several areas is mainly influenced by the precipitation (29.95% vs. 18.10%). This is because the warming trend in the Tibetan Plateau is mainly observed in the winter (Xu et al.
