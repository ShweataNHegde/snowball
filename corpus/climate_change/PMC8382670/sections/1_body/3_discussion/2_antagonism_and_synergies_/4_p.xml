<p id="Par50">Compared to precipitation, relationship between temperature and the studied ecosystem services is complex. This might be due to that precipitation can offset the opposite effects of the temperature. Also, excessive warming can cause abnormal conditions, such as a decline in NPP due to enhancing the stress of water deficit and increasing physiological drought (Wu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2011</xref>; Gu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2017</xref>) and a decline of evapotranspiration (Peterson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">1995</xref>; Brutsaert and Parlange 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1998</xref>; Roderick andÂ  Farquhar 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">2002</xref>). The impact of climate change on HQ is mainly distributed in the southeast region. This may be related presence of protected areas that increase the resistance of HQ to climate stresses.
