<p id="Par48">Regarding WR, the trend observed matched with that of precipitation, occupying near 99% of the area of non-zero value (sensitivity or value of WR service). Among the non-zero value area, near half (47.17%) of pixels showed an antagonism between temperature and precipitation, especially in the east of the study area. The reduced correlation (0.11, p &lt; 0.05) showed an antagonist effect. Also, no clustering pattern was identified.</p>
