<p id="Par49">We also explored the effect of the same climatic driving force on multiple services. For CS and WR, these two services’ trends matched precipitation in 29.06% of the area. In 12.63% of the studied area, the WR and precipitation trend is the same, contrary to that observed in CS. This result is in line with the influence of precipitation. Increased precipitation can create conditions boosting CS and WR. Moreover, the correlation coefficient (0.43, p &lt; 0.05) between the two sensitivities indicated that a large increase in WR often accompanies the high growth of CS caused by precipitation.</p>
