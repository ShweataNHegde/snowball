<p id="Par42">We also explored the conservation gaps between the current distribution of protected areas and the need to adapt to future exposure. According to the sign (negative/positive) of the exposure value to precipitation/temperature, all pixels were reclassified into eight states (Fig. S12). We then compared the distribution of protected areas and pixels where future climate change may cause loss of ecosystem services (Fig. S13). Protected areas are mainly distributed in the northwest part of the study area, while the pixels with negative exposure are mainly distributed in the southeast of the study area. For CS, under these four climate scenarios, protected areas can cover approximately 29% of the negative exposure area. However, for WR and HQ, only approximately 20 and 17% of the negative exposure area are covered by existing protected areas, respectively. The protected areas cover 38.5% of the Tibetan Plateau. The above ratios are all far less than 38.5%, indicating large conservation gaps for future exposure.</p>
