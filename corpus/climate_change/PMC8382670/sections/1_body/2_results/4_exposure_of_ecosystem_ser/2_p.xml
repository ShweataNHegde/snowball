<p id="Par41">To investigate the altitude discrepancies in the exposure of ecosystem services to climate change, a zonal average of negative and positive exposure per 50 m altitude was applied (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). We found that exposure features have a unimodal or multimodal variation with altitude, and there was a remarkable symmetry between positive and negative exposure. The largest exposure to temperature was observed at low altitudes (0–2000 m), while sporadic peaks were identified in higher elevation ranges (&gt; 2000 m). Compared to temperature, peak exposure to precipitation was observed at higher altitudes (&gt; 3000 m). In other altitude ranges, the peak intensity was not evident. The exposure was compared along the altitude gradient with the low-emission pathway (SSP1-2.6) as the baseline (Fig. S11) to identify the exposure differences under the various scenarios. A high-emission pathway (i.e., SSP5-8.5) indicates a higher intensity of exposure, whether positive or negative. As expected, the exposure under SSP5-8.5 is the highest, and the exposure intensity is close to 1.5 times higher than the baseline (SSP1-2.6) in most altitude ranges. The trajectories of exposure in SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0 scenarios are relatively consistent, and the exposure intensity of these two scenarios is slightly higher than the baseline. Even in some altitudes (e.g., exposure of WR from 2000 to 4000 m altitude), the exposure intensity under these SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0 is lower than the baseline intensity. In general, low-altitude areas face greater temperature exposure, while mid-high-altitude areas face greater precipitation exposure. The higher emission pathways increased exposure in most of the cases.
