<p id="Par40">Due to spatial heterogeneity of climate velocity (Fig. S9), the pattern of exposure exhibited a heterogeneous pattern, and a high exposure was founded in the southwest part of the studied area (Nyingchi and Sannan), and some lakes like Qinghai Lake surrounding area (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> and S10). Under the SSP1-2.6 scenario, the mean exposure of CS to precipitation was negative (− 14.87 t/km
 <sup>2</sup>), while to temperature was positive (5.71 t/km
 <sup>2</sup>). Also, climate change will boost WR’s effect and slightly inhibit the stable supply of HQ (mean exposure of 0.417 mm/km
 <sup>2</sup> for precipitation and 2.05 mm/km
 <sup>2</sup> for temperature). The distribution pattern of exposure was relatively similar to the different scenarios. However, climate change under the high-emission pathway (SSP5-8.5) tends to have greater gains or losses on ecosystem services (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). In CS, high exposure areas are mainly distributed in the East, South of the Tibetan Plateau, and surrounding areas of Qinghai Lake, while in WR, the high exposure pixels were found around the scattered lakes in the southwest and east of Tibetan Plateau. High exposure was also observed in the southeast corner (forested area) of the studied area in HQ. Except for CS, the other ecosystem services’ exposure pattern is similar to temperature and precipitation. This matched with the distribution of ecosystem services sensitivity.
