<p id="Par34">HQ changed slightly between 2001 and 2015 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e). The annual average HQ was 0.3049/km
 <sup>2</sup>·year, while the annual variation trend was approximately 5.942e-05/year (p &lt; 0.01). The high values were mainly distributed in the southeast part of the studied area (forest area) or scattered (near the lakes). Overall, HQ is very stable, and only 3.50% (2.02%) of the Tibetan Plateau exhibited a significant increased (decreased) trend. The cross-validation combined with Spearman correlation coefficient showed acceptable robustness for CS and HQ evaluation (Fig. S7). And the regression analysis also showed moderate but acceptable robustness of the HQ model: R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.40 for above-ground biomass carbon and R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.30 for tree density (Fig. S8). See Figs. S7 and S8 for more detailed validation.
