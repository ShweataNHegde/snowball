<p id="Par32">The mean CS between 2000 and2015 was 303.992 t/km
 <sup>2</sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). The linear regression trend exhibited a significant increase with an average rate of 2.654 t/km
 <sup>2</sup> year (p &lt; 0.01) (Fig. S5). High CS services occurred in the southeast and eastern regions, including Sannan, Nyingchi, Liangshan, Diqing, Aba, and Gannan. CS was close to zero in most areas, mainly located in the central and western regions of the Tibetan Plateau. The results suggested that the area where CS increased was larger than the area where it decreased (55.24% Vs. 9.91%). This contrast was small in the areas with statistically significant trends (13.60% Vs. 0.26%, p &lt; 0.05, Fig. S6).
