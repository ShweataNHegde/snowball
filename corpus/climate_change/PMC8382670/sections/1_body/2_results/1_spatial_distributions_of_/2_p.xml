<p id="Par33">The annual average amount of WR was approximately 115.423 mm/km
 <sup>2</sup> from 2001 to 2014 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). It was higher in the southeast, including Lhoka and Nyingchi. The annual amount of water retained had a non-significant decreasing trend of − 0.158 mm/km
 <sup>2</sup> (p = 0.876). Approximately 27.5% of the Tibetan Plateau exhibited an increasing trend of annual trend (3.82% with a significant increase, p &lt; 0.05). This is especially evident in the areas between 30 and 35° N, whereas decreasing WR was concentrated in the southeast region. This is consistent with the high-value area of WR service that is sporadically seen in Haibei and Hainan prefecture.
