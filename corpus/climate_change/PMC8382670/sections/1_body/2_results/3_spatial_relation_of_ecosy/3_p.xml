<p id="Par39">We also explored whether the direction of sensitivity of two different ecosystem services to a single climatic driver (precipitation or temperature) is the same (the second and third rows of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). In 29.06% of the regions, the change of direction in precipitation, CS and WR were the same, and the correlation was 0.43 (p &lt; 0.01, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>d). If the area with zero sensitivity is not considered, this proportion will be close to 70%. This shows that the increase in precipitation has a high probability of increasing CS and WR simultaneously. In 14.00% of the area, the change of direction in WR and CS was consistent with the change of direction in temperature (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>g). However, a larger area (16.72%) showed that CS and WR trends are opposite after experiencing temperature changes in the same direction. In CS and HQ (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>e), there was no apparent correlation between precipitation and ecosystem services change of direction, and the areas of the four states were relatively close.
