<p id="Par37">The first row of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> reflects whether the three ecosystem services’ sensitivity to precipitation and temperature changes is consistent. In CS, the change of direction in temperature, precipitation, and ecosystem services is consistent in 27.78% of the area (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a). In 57.13% (27.78 + 29.35%) of the pixels, we observed a CS change of direction consistent with precipitation. In 45.88% (29.35 + 18.10%) of the area, the sensitivity of CS to temperature has an opposite trend to that identified in precipitation. There was a significantly high negative correlation when sensitivity to precipitation was opposite to sensitivity to temperature (− 0.52 and − 0.54, p &lt; 0.01, yellow and blue in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a). This shows that high positive (negative) sensitivity to precipitation is accompanied by a high negative (positive) sensitivity to temperature. In this area, temperature and precipitation have antagonistic effects. Among them, the precipitation effect on ecosystem services is larger than the opposite effect of temperature in 29.35% of the pixels. Also, the CS change of direction matched the observed precipitation. However, in 18.10% of the area, precipitation cannot offset the effects of temperature, and the direction of CS changes is consistent with the temperature.
