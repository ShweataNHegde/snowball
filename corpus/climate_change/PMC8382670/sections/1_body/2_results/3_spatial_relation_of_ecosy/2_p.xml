<p id="Par38">Concerning WR, over 40% of the area showed that the change direction was consistent with the precipitation observed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b). Among them, precipitation and temperature were consistent with the direction of WR in 21.54% of the regions. In 18.86% of the pixels, the temperature direction was not consistent with WR and precipitation observed. If the area with zero sensitivity is not considered, in near 100% of the regions, the change direction of WR is the same direction as precipitation. This shows that the change of direction in WR matched with the precipitation in most cases. However, for HQ, the four states’ proportion was relatively close (5–7%, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c). This showed that the change of direction in HQ was not correlated with climate change.
