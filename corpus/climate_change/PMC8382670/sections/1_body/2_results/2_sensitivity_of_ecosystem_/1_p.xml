<p id="Par35">The sensitivity varies notably geographically for all ecosystem services, whereas the sensitivity of ecosystem services to the climate in most areas is not high (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). As for CS, the average sensitivity to precipitation is minimal (− 0.0015 t/mm·km
 <sup>2</sup>). 56.94% of the pixels had a positive sensitivity and about half a negative sensitivity (26.72%, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). High-negative sensitivity to precipitation regions was located in Qamdo and Diqing, whereas regions with high-positive sensitivity to precipitation are around Qinghai Lake and Sannan. As for the relationship between CS and temperature, 47.49 and 36.21% of study regions exhibit a positive and negative sensitivity, respectively. The negative sensitivity areas are mainly distributed in regions with high topographic relief, like the Hengduan Mountains.
