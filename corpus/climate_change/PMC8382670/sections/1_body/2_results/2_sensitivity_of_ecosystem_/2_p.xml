<p id="Par36">There is an apparent positive sensitivity between WR and precipitation with 0.614 mm/(mm·km
 <sup>2</sup>) average sensitivity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c). 41.56% of the pixels showed a positive sensitivity, and only 0.43% of the pixels showed a negative sensitivity. Compared to the sensitivity of WR to precipitation, the sensitivity to temperature was generally negative (average: − 1.172 mm/ °C·km
 <sup>2</sup>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d). The high negative sensitivity was concentrated in the South of the study region like Nyingchi. There was a relatively low sensitivity between climate change and HQ (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>e, f). The average sensitivity of HQ to precipitation and temperature was − 4.85e− 05/mm km
 <sup>2</sup> and − 1.172 °C km
 <sup>2</sup>, respectively. The regions sensitive to climate change were mainly concentrated in the southern and southeastern parts of the Tibetan Plateau.
