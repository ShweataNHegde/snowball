<p id="Par12">Tibetan Plateau is located in western China, and covers Xizang, Qinghai, and part of the Gansu, Xinjiang, Yunnan, and Sichuan provinces of China (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The mean elevation of the Tibetan Plateau is more than 4000 m above sea level, and it is known as “the Roof of the World”. It is also the largest ice reservoir outside the polar regions and a source of several major Asian rivers such as the Yellow River, the Yangtze River, and the Mekong River. These rivers supply water for more than a billion people downstream (Immerzeel et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2005</xref>; Immerzeel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2010</xref>), it acts as an important ecological security barrier including climate regulation and biodiversity conservation. Tibetan Plateau is characterized by low temperature, intense radiation, and low precipitation (see Fig. S1 for the spatial distribution of temperature and precipitation). From southeast to northwest, the vegetation types are broadleaf forest, needleleaf forest, shrub, grassland, and desert, respectively (Fig. S2). These ecosystems are fragile and sensitive to climate change (Li et al.
