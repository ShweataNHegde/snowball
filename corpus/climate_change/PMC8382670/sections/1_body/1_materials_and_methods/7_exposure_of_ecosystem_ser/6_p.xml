<p id="Par30">A zonal average of negative and positive exposure per 50 m altitude was applied to investigate the altitude discrepancies in the ecosystem services exposure to climate change. Also, we further explored the exposure intensity of ecosystem services to climate change along the altitude gradient under four climate scenarios. The low-emission pathway (SSP1-2.6) was regarded as the baseline. Exposure intensity is the ratio of exposure of SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5 to the baseline (SSP1-2.6).</p>
