<p id="Par25">The calculation of climate change velocity was based on climate data between the contemporary (1970–2000) and future (2041–2060) periods following the research of Li et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2018a</xref>). Four future pathway scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5) were selected from eight global climate models. We used the average output of eight global climate models to characterize the future climate to reduce a single model’s uncertainty, according to Li et al. (
