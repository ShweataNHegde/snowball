<p id="Par31">Protected areas data was introduced to identify the gap between the current distribution of protected areas and adapt future exposure. According to the sign (negative/positive) of the exposure value to climate change, all pixels were reclassified into eight classes: “positive–negative”, “positive-positive”, “negative-negative”, “negative–positive”, “positive-0”, “negative-0”, “0-positive” and “0-negative”. Among them, “positive–negative” means that the exposure to precipitation is positive and that to temperature is negative, and “0” means that exposure to precipitation/temperature is 0. “Negative-negative”, “negative-0” and “0-negative” mean that future climate change may lead to losses of ecosystem services. Subsequently, we compared the gap between the distribution of these three states and protected areas based on spatial overlay analysis. In our framework, “positive–negative” and “negative–positive” were not considered, since we cannot yet determine the final direction of influence of future climate change. All the spatial and statistical analyses were conducted based on ArcGIS 10.5 and Matlab R2014a.</p>
