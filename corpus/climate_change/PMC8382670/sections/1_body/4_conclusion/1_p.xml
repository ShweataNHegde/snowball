<p id="Par57">Climate change induces positive or negative impacts on ecosystem services. The direction and intensity of the effect of climatic drivers (temperature and precipitation) on ecosystem services needs be spatialized. This will help to understand the geographic patterns and adapt better strategies to climate change. As demonstrated in this study, under the interaction of climate, human activities, altitude, and other factors, the sensitivity distribution patterns of these ecosystem services studied to climate change vary obviously. For CS, more than half of the regions showed a positive sensitivity to climate change, although the degree of sensitivity was not high. The regions where HQ was sensitive to climate change were mainly concentrated in the southern and southeastern parts. Increasing precipitation has a high probability of improving CS and WR as well. The existing protected areas have important conservation gaps regarding the disturbance of future climate change on ecosystem services, especially in the southeastern part of the study area. In practice, management priorities should be given to these high exposure areas and conservation gaps during the ongoing establishment of the national park group. Given the high universality of the sensitivity-exposure framework, it can be applied to other regions to identify the vulnerability area for ecosystem service conservation practices. Furthermore, exploring the spatial association between the ecosystem services and their climatic drivers can provide a comprehensive and spatially explicit understanding, which helps optimize the response strategy in the context of global warming.</p>
