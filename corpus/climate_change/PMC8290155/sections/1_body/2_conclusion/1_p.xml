<p>The conclusion is based on the current studies on the relationship between COVID-19 and air pollution and climate change. Many studies have shown that several air contaminants, including PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>, PM
 <sub>10</sub>, CO, NO
 <sub>2</sub>, SO
 <sub>2</sub>, and O
 <sub>3</sub>, increase COVID-19 mortality rates. However, some research suggests that COVID-19's indirect effect could help to reduce air pollution. Particulate matter has been linked to a rise in COVID-19 incidents. Although the current study lacks adequate evidence for conclusive findings for CO and SO
 <sub>2</sub>, which are both negatively and positively associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Current research has discovered both a negative and a positive relationship between NO
 <sub>x</sub> and COVID-19 in different parts of the world. As a marker of SARS-CoV-2, O
 <sub>3</sub> was found to be significantly associated with COVID-19 and air pollution-related infections. While there has been no conclusive evidence of the effect of climate change on COVID-19, which is typically a long-term phenomenon. A few studied suggested that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher airborne survival and transmission rate than the influenza virus in tropical areas. While the direct effect of the pandemic-driven response will reduce a global temperature by 2030. The relationship between temperature, humidity, and wind speed can be used to support the correlation between the atmosphere and COVID-19 events. Since there are uncertainty in the relationships between COVID-19 and air pollution and climate change, the meta-analysis should be conducted in the future work.
