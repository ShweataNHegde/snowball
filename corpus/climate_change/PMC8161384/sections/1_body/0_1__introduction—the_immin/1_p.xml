<p>How plants and crops will respond to a warmer and drier climate is currently one of the most discussed multi-disciplinary questions in the fields of environmental science, ecology, and evolution. It is estimated that climate change effects may limit global crop production by at least 10% in 2050 [

 <xref rid="B2-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], especially in vulnerable regions around the globe where heat, drought, and malnutrition are already substantial. Given that current agricultural resources might not be sufficient to meet future food demand [
 <xref rid="B3-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], crop wild relatives and landraces historically adapted to dry and semi-arid environments are key sources of yet unexplored diversity with respect to major food crops [
 <xref rid="B4-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Exotics may donate necessary genetic variation to make heat and drought-tolerant cultivars, or may even stand as novel crops by themselves [
