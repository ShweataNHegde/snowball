<p>However, efforts to capture and pyramid target tolerant variants from the wild still face major challenges. First, identifying useful variation in wild accessions through field trials (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-12-00783-f001">Figure 1</xref>a) has been inefficient because of the disparity in growth rates and phenologies [
 <xref rid="B9-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This limitation is reinforced by a complex inheritance of the abiotic stress tolerant phenotypes involving many genes of low effects and several environmental interactions [
 <xref rid="B10-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Second, the domestication syndrome typically neglected heat and drought tolerance in the majority of crop species [
 <xref rid="B11-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] because these adaptations in wild populations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-12-00783-f001">Figure 1</xref>b) tend to perpetuate vegetative phases, delay reproductive stages, and therefore compromise overall yield [
 <xref rid="B13-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Due to this, transferring variation from wild exotic donors into elite lines may induce undesired linked trait variation such as flowering delay and reduced crop yields (e.g., in 
 <italic>Phaseolus</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B14-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]).
