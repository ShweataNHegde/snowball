<p>With the advent of the genomic era, heat and drought tolerance molecular pathways have been extensively studied [

 <xref rid="B17-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and numerous candidate genes and genetic marker associations have already been identified and validated (e.g., ABA-dependent or independent pathways, and

 <xref rid="B21-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]). Coupling these comprehensive datasets with novel analytical tools harbors the potential to identify and unlock useful genetic variation among crop wild relatives and landraces to challenge with abiotic stresses. In the following sections, we outline the main avenues to establish novel sources of abiotic stress tolerance variation from wild crop relatives and semi-domesticated landraces (

We finish by emphasizing the need to enable the construction and long-term maintenance of big heterogeneous dataset repositories capable of powering these innovative predictive strategies.
