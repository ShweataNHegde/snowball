<p>Besides the methodological innovations of ML in terms of data merging and optimized classifications, extensions of this type of research are likely to assist hybrid breeding and polyploid utilization [
 <xref rid="B162-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>], both of which take advantage of dominance and over-dominance effects already present in nature, capable of increasing adaptability to abiotic stresses [

 <xref rid="B171-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>]. An antecedent in this direction is that GP can predict untested hybrid genotypes [
 <xref rid="B172-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>], even for perennial crops [

 <xref rid="B173-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>,
 <xref rid="B174-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>], by genotyping the potential parental lines and phenotyping a few F1 hybrids. Approximate-Bayesian Computation (ABC) analyses within ML [

 <xref rid="B175-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>] may in turn speed up polyploid selection.
