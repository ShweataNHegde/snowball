<p>Nowadays, it is anticipated that ML will overtake current GP models in the near future by incorporating explicit environmental variables and habitat adaptation indices (

Combining trans-disciplinary datasets from different origins and disciplines will ultimately improve the prediction of the phenotypic variance and the genotype × environment interaction, while sidestepping the restrictions of traditional breeding schemes to increase genetic gain for abiotic stress tolerance per unit of time.
