<p>Extending these ultimate analytical approaches will help to resolve major basic questions in the field [
 <xref rid="B205-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">205</xref>] such as to which scale diversifying selection promotes [
 <xref rid="B206-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>] and gene flow precludes [
 <xref rid="B207-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">207</xref>,
 <xref rid="B208-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">208</xref>] local adaptation, and whether large haplotype blocks are pervasive in adaptation signatures due to structural variants [
 <xref rid="B209-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">209</xref>] such as chromosomal inversions [
 <xref rid="B210-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">210</xref>,
 <xref rid="B211-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">211</xref>]. Targeting these issues will allow trans-disciplinary research teams to move into more applied matters like (1) how GP and ML can be intermingled to turbocharge genebanks [
 <xref rid="B212-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">212</xref>] while disentangling the correlated trade-off complexity in proxy traits as part of speed breeding strategies [
 <xref rid="B125-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>,
 <xref rid="B126-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>], and (2) what is the optimum pathway for pan-genomes [
 <xref rid="B213-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">213</xref>] and epigenetics [
 <xref rid="B214-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">214</xref>] to unlock the properties of plants for sustainable development [
 <xref rid="B215-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">215</xref>]. Approaching these enquiries would enable genomics to cut threats of future global food security from climate change by harnessing crop wild diversity and genebank utilization. After all, a key promise of agriculture genomics [
 <xref rid="B216-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">216</xref>] is to potentiate genebanks through impact-oriented pre-breeding [
 <xref rid="B217-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">217</xref>] in the face of the current alimentary and climate emergency [
 <xref rid="B218-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">218</xref>].
