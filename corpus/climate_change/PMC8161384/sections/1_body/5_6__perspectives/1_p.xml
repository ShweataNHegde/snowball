<p>In terms of required innovations, it would be desirable to develop high-resolution fitness maps for various types of stresses [
 <xref rid="B228-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">228</xref>], and to standardize genome-wide polygenetic scores (GPS) [
 <xref rid="B229-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">229</xref>] by minimizing genomic pseudo-correlation or linkage disequilibrium (LD) [
 <xref rid="B230-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">230</xref>,
 <xref rid="B231-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">231</xref>,
 <xref rid="B232-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">232</xref>], in order to predict novel abiotic stress tolerant sources in concert with other resistances and nutritional quality for the poorest. It is also becoming more essential to assess second-order genomic-context dependent associations (epistatic effects) as a tool to point toward more complex infinitesimal polygenic systems [
 <xref rid="B233-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">233</xref>] capable of accounting for the missing heritability [
 <xref rid="B58-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,
 <xref rid="B234-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">234</xref>,
 <xref rid="B235-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">235</xref>] in adaptation, while enhancing innovative genomic-assisted selection strategies that do not exclusively rely on MAS and GP, but also on ML.
