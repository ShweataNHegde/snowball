<p>Looking forward, the discipline of quantitative genetics is merging with the field of ‘big data’ analytics, a ground for ML (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-12-00783-f001">Figure 1</xref>). An expanded view of complex traits is arising, moving from a polygenic framework to a view in which all genes are liable to affect adaptation to abiotic stresses [
 <xref rid="B220-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">220</xref>], so that most heritability can be explained by the effects of rare variants [

 <xref rid="B222-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">222</xref>] and their interactions with epigenetic factors [
 <xref rid="B223-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">223</xref>]. However, looking back toward the bases of crop evolution [
 <xref rid="B23-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] still has the potential to improve agriculture because natural selection has tested more options than humans ever will [
 <xref rid="B35-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We envision that mining the molecular footprint of selection and adaptation in wild crop relatives and early landraces for plant breeding [
 <xref rid="B224-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">224</xref>] and climate adaptation [
 <xref rid="B125-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>,
 <xref rid="B225-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">225</xref>] will benefit from bridging the gap between phenotyping (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-12-00783-f001">Figure 1</xref>a) and genotyping (

 <xref rid="B227-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">227</xref>], and the more classical and deterministic conceptual models from the fields of quantitative and population genetics.
