<p>Genomic signatures of adaptation to dry and semi-arid habitats (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-12-00783-f001">Figure 1</xref>b) are useful for germplasm characterization, enhancing the identification of novel sources of variation, future genome-assisted selection, and crop improvement for abiotic stress tolerance. Ultimately, these analytical approaches, coupled with ML, promise improving the accuracy of parent selection to be used in pre-breeding and breeding steps, besides reinforcing the relevance of crops and their wild relatives as systems to address classic questions in the fields of quantitative genetics, evolutionary biology, and ecological genetics.
