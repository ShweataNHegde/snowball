<p>Mining the biodiversity in genebanks [

 <xref rid="B219-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">219</xref>] is a prerequisite to overcome food shortages due to increasing temperatures and drought. While climate data and genomics can speed up the identification (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-12-00783-f001">Figure 1</xref>c) of novel sources of tolerance, merging these data types more cohesively into cutting edge analytical frameworks like GP and ML will aid unlocking (

In order to start moving toward this goal, genebank research should focus on (1) studying the genetic and ecological mechanisms of adaptation and diversification in crop species, while (2) investigating the genetic potential of wild relatives to cope with abiotic stresses, both by examining historical and novel germplasm materials. The research community must pay close attention to the discovery of locally adapted varieties and landraces (
