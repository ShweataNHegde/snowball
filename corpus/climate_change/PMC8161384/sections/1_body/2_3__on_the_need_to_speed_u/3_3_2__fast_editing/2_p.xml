<p>Furthermore, predictive breeding and gene editing should not be conceived as separate, non-overlapping approaches. Integration of molecular genetics and genomic analyses with more quantitative approaches has the potential to speed up various other efforts in addition to understand how plants are naturally adapted to drier climates, aiding in the innovation of biotechnological strategies and breeding programs to generate elite lines that are more productive and more capable of adapting to anticipated heat waves and drought events [

This is particularly true for complex traits, because even though CRISPR-Cas9 can quickly transfer major elements responsible for the abiotic stress tolerance response, its omni/polygenic nature demands assistance from other approaches like GP. Merging molecular mechanistic details that are often overlooked by genome-based assisted selection, with GP, breeding simulations [
