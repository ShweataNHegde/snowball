<p>GP uses historical phenotypic data [
 <xref rid="B98-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>] to calibrate marker-based infinitesimal additive predictive models [
 <xref rid="B99-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>,
 <xref rid="B100-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>,
 <xref rid="B101-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>], which provide a more comprehensive representation of a quantitative polygenic trait than traditional genetic mapping [
 <xref rid="B102-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Hence, GP offers a key path to assist the introgression breeding of abiotic stress tolerance from the wild. GPâ€™s predictive ability can be significantly enhanced after performing 
 <italic>a priori</italic> weighted trait mapping through more conventional methods such as quantitative-trait loci (QTL) mapping [
 <xref rid="B103-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>], or genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [
 <xref rid="B104-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>], even across SNP-genotyped multi-parental populations [
 <xref rid="B105-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>,
 <xref rid="B106-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>,

 <xref rid="B109-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. GP may also go beyond breeding efforts, and feed back on optimizing restoration [
 <xref rid="B102-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] and genebank characterization [
 <xref rid="B110-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>] (e.g., by predicting seed morphometric traits [
 <xref rid="B111-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>] and yield [
 <xref rid="B112-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>,
 <xref rid="B113-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]) of thousands of germplasm accessions that could hardly be tested in field trials.
