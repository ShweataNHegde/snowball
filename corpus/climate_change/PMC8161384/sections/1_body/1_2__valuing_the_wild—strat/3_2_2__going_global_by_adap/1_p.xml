<p>Germplasm collections should be used not only to introduce exotic variation but also to avoid genetic erosion and increase long-term adaptability to climate change by making crops more resistant to abiotic stresses such as heat and drought. Local adaptation to abiotic factors can be studied using historical climate at the habitats where geo-referenced germplasm accessions were originally collected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-12-00783-f001">Figure 1</xref>b). If an ecological balance [
 <xref rid="B42-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] between genotypes and environments can be assumed [

 <xref rid="B44-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] (Humboldt’s ‘harmony in nature’), geo-referencing and repositories of 
 <italic>in situ</italic> climate variables can then be used to compute adaptive capacity. The former condition typically applies for landraces and crop wild relatives because they have occupied local niches long enough as to be shaped by natural selection forces [
 <xref rid="B45-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This approach has typically relied on clustering algorithms to predict (

 <xref rid="B47-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], and thermal tolerance [
 <xref rid="B48-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], but also resistance to pathogens [
