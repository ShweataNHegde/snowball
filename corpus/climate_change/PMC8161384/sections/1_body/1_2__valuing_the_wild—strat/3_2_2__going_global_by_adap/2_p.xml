<p>Genomic analytical tools (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-12-00783-f001">Figure 1</xref>f) of adaptive trait variation to abiotic stresses are genome-wide selection scans (GWSS) [
 <xref rid="B51-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and genome–environment associations (GEA) [
 <xref rid="B52-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Both approaches aim to capture the signatures of selection to different environments by retrieving those genomic regions that segregate and are fixed among contrasting habitats (e.g., arid vs. wet regions) [

 <xref rid="B54-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The strategies differ in that the former uses outlier tests given a background (‘baseline’) distribution, usually within a Bayesian framework [
 <xref rid="B55-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], while the latter relies on mixed linear models (MLMs) that explicitly incorporate covariates as random effects [
 <xref rid="B56-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Because these analyses may be misleading [

 <xref rid="B59-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] are not appropriately accounted for, MLMs are nowadays the preferred method to describe the genetic basis of local adaptation in germplasm collections [
 <xref rid="B60-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Other major improvements are the use of indices, rather than raw environmental variables, that summarize precise physiological processes (e.g., thermal thresholds and potential evapotranspiration models to infer heat/drought stress) [
