<p>Natural selection rarely misses key adaptive improvements. For instance, it has already improved the efficiency of photosynthesis and water use [
 <xref rid="B35-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], which are major developments to enhance the yield potential that has increased little in recent decades. Therefore, inferring 
 <italic>in situ</italic> genetic adaptation to heat and drought stresses, usually from 
 <italic>ex situ</italic> geo-referenced widespread collections of crop wild relatives, has become a prerequisite to capture these naturally available exotic variants. Unfortunately, after a century of collecting and preserving diversity in plants throughout germplasm banks, living seed collections that serve as repositories of genetic and ecological variation [
 <xref rid="B36-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], 
 <italic>ex situ</italic> collections do not necessarily fully span the ecological niche of agricultural crop relatives [
 <xref rid="B37-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] as to establish new sources of genes for improving complex adaptive traits. Nowadays, wild relatives are still discovered [
 <xref rid="B39-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and further expeditions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-12-00783-f001">Figure 1</xref>d) are needed (e.g., in the ecological hyper-variable and species-rich neotropics) [
 <xref rid="B40-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Because isolated pockets of cryptic diversity still persist, novel habitat-based population-guided collections for genebanks are paramount, now more than ever.
