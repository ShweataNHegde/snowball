<p>Domestication has been the most ambitious evolutionary experiment humanity has ever embarked on [

 <xref rid="B23-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], it has served as a playground for geneticists and biologists to explore the patterns and processes during crop evolution [

 <xref rid="B26-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. For instance, it has allowed humans to test hypothesis such as whether dual domestication syndromes have recruited the same genetic variants in parallel [
 <xref rid="B27-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], or whether genomic divergence is more prone to harbor signatures of selection due to reduced recombination and increased drift [
 <xref rid="B28-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In this way, domestication has invited researchers to study the repeatability of evolution [
 <xref rid="B29-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and the relative role of isolation, migration, and hybridization [
 <xref rid="B30-genes-12-00783" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], long standing questions in evolutionary biology [
