<p>The same three authors (F.C., S.A., and M.P.) assessed all studies for which appropriate quality assessment tools were available (
 <italic>n</italic> = 93). We used the ‘Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies’ and ‘Case Series Studies’ Quality Assessment tools from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) [
 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-18-04486" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The NHLBI tools were robustly developed and include individualised tools for a range of study designs (e.g., cohort, cross-sectional, case series). Qualitative studies were assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) Qualitative Checklist [

 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-18-04486" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], with the “sample size” and “validity of statistical inferences” criteria removed as their specificity was not deemed relevant to providing an overall quality assessment of the studies included in the review. We did not assess the quality of studies employing modelling, case report, time-series, case-crossover, panel, or other unique study designs due to the lack of appropriate quality assessment tools.
