<p>The majority of studies (
 <italic>n</italic> = 101 out of 120) examined the mental health risks posed by climate change. The literature linked mental health outcomes to several climate-related exposuresâ€”heat, humidity, rainfall, drought, wildfires, and floods. Other environmental exposures, such as tropical cyclones and storms, were not included as no studies were found that explicitly referred to climate change. This section will present studies according to the following three categories (which are not mutually exclusive): (1) environmental exposures; (2) mental health outcomes; and (3) specific sub-groups and contexts that might be particularly vulnerable to the impact of climate change on mental health.
