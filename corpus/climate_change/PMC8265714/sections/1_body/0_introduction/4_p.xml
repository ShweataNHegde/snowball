<p id="Par13">In order to clearly see the relevance of these distinctions, let us have a look at the following quotation from Symons’ book on ecomodernism:
 <disp-quote>
  <p id="Par14">Ecomodernists are often called techno-optimists. The term puzzles me. Most ecomodernists are pessimistic about the likely trajectory of climate change–they think warming above 2°C is now inevitable. Most are pessimistic about the potential for existing technologies to achieve decarbonization … They are pessimistic about proposals for intermittent renewable energy … [E]comodernists are pessimistic about the prospects for international cooperation … So why are ecomodernists called optimists? I think it’s because, despite the real risk that climate change will prove catastrophic, they argue that through the wise use of science a ‘good Anthropocene’ could be possible (Symons, 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2019</xref>, 25–26).

 </disp-quote>We see here that ecomodernists are considered pessimists concerning climate change as an unmitigated or poorly mitigated process (2a). Moreover, they are pessimists concerning various specific mitigation measures such as the use of existing technologies, renewable energy and international cooperation (2c). Nevertheless, ecomodernists are optimists concerning certain other mitigation measures (2c) and mitigation in general (2b). Through a “wise” application of science they expect a good future for humankind. So, ecomodernists are pessimists concerning some aspects and optimists concerning others. As we will see below, this holds also for other positions in the debate on climate change.
