<p id="Par4">In order to carry out the analysis, a few conceptual clarifications (or analytic tools) are needed. First, ‘pessimism’ and ‘optimism’ can be understood in different ways, for example as:
 <list list-type="order">
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par5">a psychological process or state of expecting a negative or positive, respectively, outcome of processes or actions,</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par6">an argued position of expecting a negative or positive, respectively, outcome of processes or actions.</p>
  </list-item>
 </list>Second, in the context of climate change, pessimism and optimism may concern different aspects. A person can be a pessimist regarding some aspects and an optimist regarding others. For example, pessimism and optimism may concern:
 <list list-type="alpha-lower">
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par7">climate change as an unmitigated or poorly mitigated process,</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par8">mitigation of climate change,</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par9">specific measures of mitigation of climate change,</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par10">adaptation to climate change, or</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par11">specific measures of adaptation to climate change.</p>
  </list-item>
 </list>In this paper the main focus will be on argued positions concerning climate change as an unmitigated or poorly mitigated process (2a), mitigation of climate change (2b) and specific measures of mitigation of climate change (2c). However, I will also to a limited extent investigate (2d) and (2e). I will not analyse pessimism/optimism as a psychological process or state (1).
