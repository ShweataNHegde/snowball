<p id="Par16">The various positions on pessimism/optimism concerning climate change are based on certain assumptions about climate change. In my analysis I focus only on positions that accept the following assumptions:
 <list list-type="simple">
  <list-item>
   <label>(i)</label>
   <p id="Par17">climate change is real,</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <label>(ii)</label>
   <p id="Par18">climate change is to a substantial extent caused by human action (mainly the use of fossil fuels), and</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <label>(iii)</label>
   <p id="Par19">climate change is a serious and urgent problem.</p>
  </list-item>
 </list>Climate optimism based on a denial of the reality of climate change, or on a denial that it is to a substantial extent caused by human action, or on a denial that it is a serious and urgent problem, will not be discussed. Positions accepting (i), (ii) and (iii) may still differ on (iii), that is, on how serious and urgent the problem of climate change is thought to be.
