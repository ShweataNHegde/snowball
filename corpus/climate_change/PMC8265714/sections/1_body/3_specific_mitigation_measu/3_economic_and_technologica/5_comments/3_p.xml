<p id="Par80">The situation is similar regarding the role of economic growth. Is growth the fundamental cause of climate change or part of the solution? This is not just a matter of science. Here the influence of ideological assumptions becomes particularly obvious. Some argue that there are limits to growth and that we need a steady state economy in order to mitigate climate change. They are pessimistic concerning (absolute) decoupling of growth from resource use and emissions. This pessimism is sometimes influenced by some version of democratic eco-socialist ideology (Klein, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2019</xref>; Pettifor, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2019</xref>). Others argue that it is possible to decouple growth from resource use and emissions. They may be influenced by a green pro-capitalist ideology (McAfee, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2019</xref>) or by liberal (Asafu-Adjaye et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2015</xref>) or social democratic ecomodernism (Symons, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2019</xref>).
