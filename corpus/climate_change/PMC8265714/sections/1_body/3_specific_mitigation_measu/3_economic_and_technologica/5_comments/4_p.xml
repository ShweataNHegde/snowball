<p id="Par81">Many commentators look for a technological solution to the problem of climate change. They differ, however, on which kind of technology to develop. Supporters of traditional green ideology are optimistic concerning renewable energy and energy-efficient technology (Boyd, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015</xref>). Advocates of liberal or social democratic ecomodernism are pessimistic concerning this option and argue that it is insufficient. They emphasize that we need nuclear power (Asafu-Adjaye et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2015</xref>) or geoengineering (Symons, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2019</xref>) for successful mitigation of climate change. So, also when it comes to pessimism and optimism concerning specific technologies ideological assumptions play a crucial role.
