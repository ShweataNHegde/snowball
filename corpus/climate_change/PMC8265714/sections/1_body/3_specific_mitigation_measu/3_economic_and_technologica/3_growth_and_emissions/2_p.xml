<p id="Par73">Pessimists concerning the mitigation option of decoupling maintain that historical evidence suggests that permanent and absolute (not merely relative) decoupling of growth and resource use at a global scale is not possible, although it may occur in high-income countries under very optimistic conditions and in the shorter term. Moreover, they argue that while permanent absolute decoupling of growth and emissions is technically possible nationally as well as globally in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement of attaining the goals of 1.5 °C or at least 2 °C, it is highly improbable even under very optimistic conditions and in the long run (Hickel &amp; Kallis,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2019</xref>). This makes reduced use of resources and reduced emissions necessary. There are limits to growth (Meadows et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1972</xref>). We need to recognize these limits and find ways of living within planetary boundaries. Reduced use of resources and reduced emissions will save the planet and mitigate climate change (O’Neill et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2018</xref>). In line with this Pettifor argues for a Green New Deal aiming at a steady state economy (Pettifor,
