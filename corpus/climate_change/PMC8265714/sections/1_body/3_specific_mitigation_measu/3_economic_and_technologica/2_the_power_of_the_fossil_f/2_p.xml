<p id="Par71">To this kind of argument optimists may respond in different ways. One option is to stress that this picture of the fossil fuel industry is too dark. Eventually these companies will recognize that they can make profits by investing in an energy transition and thereby create new job opportunities as well as meet the demands of consumers who prefer zero-carbon products. Moreover, optimists may argue that capitalism has a dynamic of its own leading to an energy transition. Capitalism together with a ‘responsive government’ is the solution to the problem. This is stressed, for example, by McAfee (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2019</xref>, 59; Klein, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2019</xref>, 250–252).
