<p id="Par77">However, optimists may have very diverging views on which technologies and energy sources may resolve the mitigation problem. Many optimists stress that several green technologies already exist and are likely to be further developed, exemplifying with electric vehicles and energy-efficient buildings (Boyd, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015</xref>, 159–185). Some also argue for not yet developed technologies such as geoengineering, for example, spraying particles into the stratosphere that reflect solar radiation back into space. They view this as a kind of plan B shouldn’t other mitigation measures be sufficient (Symons, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2019</xref>, 169–182). Regarding energy much optimism is linked to already existing renewable energy sources such as hydroelectric power, solar power and wind power (Grubb, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2018</xref>). Many also highlight technologies under development such as technologies for capturing and storing carbon dioxide with the goal of achieving negative emissions (Symons, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2019</xref>, 91, 106). Some tech-optimists stress the importance of continued use of nuclear power and development of 4th generation fission reactors. They may also suggest further research on nuclear fusion (Asafu-Adjaye et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2015</xref>). However, proponents of nuclear power often admit that it meets strong resistance in many countries and among most environmental organizations, making this option less feasible (McAfee, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2019</xref>, 250–252).
