<p id="Par88">Optimists may respond in at least four ways. First, the tragedy of the commons can be avoided, as indicated by the economic and national security arguments mentioned above. To a large extent it is in national self-interest to mitigate climate change (Stern, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2015</xref>). Second, McAfee argues that the problem can be handled by “the four horsemen of the optimist: capitalism, tech progress, responsive government, and public awareness” (McAfee, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2019</xref>, 265; see also 183–189, 265–268). Third, Posner and colleagues maintain that international collaboration could be more successful if it is decoupled from issues of justice. A fundamental problem with recent attempts of international collaboration is that collaboration has been linked to issues of corrective justice (for example, the polluter-pays principle) or distributive justice (for example, the ability-to-pay principle). This linkage has made some rich countries reluctant to commit. A decoupling could make them more willing. Based on a cost–benefit analysis, they may conclude that they are better off with collaboration than not. They may collaborate, for example, out of self-interest or a wish to help countries in need (see Posner &amp; Sunstein, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2008</xref>; Posner &amp; Weisbach, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2010</xref>). Fourth, history shows that international collaboration on environmental issues has sometimes been successful. A key example is the Montreal Protocol 1987 concerning protection of the ozone layer (Boyd, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015</xref>, 96–99).
