<p id="Par87">This brings us to the next issue: Is it in national self-interest to cooperate internationally in order to mitigate climate change? Are international agreements on emission reductions likely and will they be sufficiently efficient? A fundamental problem for international cooperation is that climate change is a global commons problem. Pessimists regarding international cooperation commonly use the more pessimistic designation ‘tragedy of the commons.’ The need for global solutions on climate issues is counteracted by narrow-minded and short-sighted national interests. Free-riding is too convenient (Gardiner, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2006</xref>). In addition to these theoretical aspects, pessimists may also stress the sad history of unsuccessful international climate collaborations. A decade ago, Røgeberg and colleagues concluded that the Kyoto Protocol was “a largely ineffective treaty” and that “the history of the Kyoto Protocol confirms the case for pessimism more than it does the contrary position” (Røgeberg et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2010</xref>). More recently, Schröder and Storm commenting on the 2015 Paris Agreement point out that “[t]he early optimism about the Paris COP21 is giving way to a widespread pessimism that the COP21 will not be working soon enough” (Schröder &amp; Storm, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2018</xref>). The global emissions have not been reduced, but rather increased, despite all climate conferences. Some important countries have not been willing to commit themselves sufficiently (Heatley,
