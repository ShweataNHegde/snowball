<p id="Par84">Optimists regarding national politics, on the other hand, may stress the economic advantages of climate change mitigation for individual countries. As Stern points out: “… most of what is necessary for emissions reductions over the next two decades is in the self-interest of the individual nations” (Stern, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2015</xref>, 85; for an analysis of this kind of argument, see Nordgren, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2016</xref>). Green technology and an energy transition away from carbon may lead to more energy-efficient industrial production (Green, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2015</xref>) and have co-benefits in terms of improved health and reduced air pollution (Karlsson et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>). Moreover, it may be less costly for nations to prevent adverse effects of climate change by early reduction of emissions than by initiating adaptation measures at a later stage (given that the mitigation measures actually lead to a reduction). Another approach to national politics is suggested by the proposal for a Green New Deal. Pettifor stresses the necessity of the state taking control over the financial and monetary system in order to mitigate climate change. She also expresses optimism regarding the success of such an endeavour (Pettifor, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2019</xref>, xvi–xvii, 8–9).
