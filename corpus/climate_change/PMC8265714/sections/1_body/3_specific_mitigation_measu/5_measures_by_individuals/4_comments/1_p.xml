<p id="Par98">Political ideologies put varying emphasis on the significance of individual action in mitigation of climate change. It is obvious that liberal ecomodernists like the authors of 
 <italic>An Ecomodernist Manifesto</italic> (Asafu-Adjaye et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2015</xref>) as well as social democratic ecomodernists like Symons (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2019</xref>) stress high-tech innovation much stronger than individual action. It is also clear that democratic eco-socialists like Pettifor emphasize transformation of the financial system rather than measures by individuals (Pettifor, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2019</xref>). In contrast, traditional green ideology has often emphasized the responsibility of individuals as consumers and citizens. By changing their consumption patterns, individuals may influence which products are offered on the market and thereby the greenhouse gas emissions. By exercising their democratic rights to vote, individuals may influence politics in a climate-friendly direction (Boyd, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015</xref>, 198). Basically, proponents of these ideologies are all positive to mitigation efforts by individuals (even if they may not accept all kinds of efforts). However, there are ideology-dependent differences in emphasis and behind these differences in emphasis there are ideology-dependent differences in how pessimistic or optimistic they are concerning the significance of individual action.
