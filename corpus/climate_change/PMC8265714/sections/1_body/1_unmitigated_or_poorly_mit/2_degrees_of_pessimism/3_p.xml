<p id="Par29">So, scientists generally agree that climate change is a serious and urgent problem but show some disagreement on exactly how serious and how urgent. They are to a varying extent pessimistic concerning its trajectory and adverse effects. Examples of adverse effects are extreme weather events, flooding, drought, wildfires, sea-level rise, destruction of ecosystems, extinction of species, sustainability problems for indigenous populations, spreading of diseases, unequal global distribution of harm (low-income countries are likely to suffer more than high-income countries), migration (climate refugees), reduced global food security (for example, famines), and socio-economic tensions (resulting, for example, in social collapse or war) (IPCC, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2014</xref>, 64–74). Some of these adverse effects can to some extent already be seen at 1 °C above preindustrial levels. Moreover, they are projected to become worse at 1.5 °C, and even more so at 2.0 °C (IPCC, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2018</xref>), which are the goals of the COP21 Paris Agreement (UNFCCC, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2015</xref>). With the present momentum global warming is heading towards 3 °C by 2100 (Hausfather &amp; Peters, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2020</xref>) or even higher (Schwalm et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2020</xref>) with further disastrous impact.
