<p id="Par31">An important explanation to the disagreement on the trajectory and impact of climate change is the uncertainty of climate models (Kunreuther et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2014</xref>). Climate systems are complex, dynamic and non-linear. The models simulating them are therefore characterized by uncertainty. The uncertainty may be due to, for example, uncertainty about initial conditions (observations) and future emissions (Gettelman &amp; Rood, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2016</xref>, 228). Uncertainty may concern the climate system response, that is, the relation between emissions and temperature rise. This rise is “likely” in the range of 0.8–2.5 °C per trillion tonnes of carbon emitted as CO2 (IPCC, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2014</xref>, 62), which is a very large span. Moreover, uncertainty may concern the impact of a particular temperature rise. In addition to these physical factors, uncertainty is also due to social, economic, technological and political factors. Social systems are also complex, dynamic and non-linear. Any assessment of the future trajectory and impact of climate change must therefore include also interactions of climate systems and social systems (King et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2015</xref>, 18–20, 31–32).
