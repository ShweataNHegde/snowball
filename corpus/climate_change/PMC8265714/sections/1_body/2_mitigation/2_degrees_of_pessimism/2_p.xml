<p id="Par37">Roy Scranton, an American writer and scholar in English and environmental humanities, holds a similar pessimistic view on mitigation and suggests similarly that we should focus on adaptation rather than mitigation. He maintains that this view is already widely spread:

  <p id="Par38">From the perspective of many policy experts, climate scientists, and national security officials, the concern is not whether global warming exists or how we might prevent it, but how we are going to adapt to life in the hot, volatile world we’ve created (Scranton, 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2015</xref>, 17).

 </disp-quote>According to Scranton, adaptation fundamentally means ‘learning to die in the Anthropocene’ (the title of one of his books), that is, learning to psychologically and culturally cope with the new disastrous world resulting from global warming (Scranton, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2015</xref>).
