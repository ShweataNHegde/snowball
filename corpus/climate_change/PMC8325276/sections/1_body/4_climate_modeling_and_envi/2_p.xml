<p>The rapid development of climate modeling since the mid-20th century led to the increased availability of paleoclimate information. The mutual benefits to be gained from working together fostered new collaborations between paleoclimate modelers, Earth scientists, and archaeologists and a revived interest in human/environment interactions. The “Stage 3 project,” for example, introduced climate modeling to a large and receptive archaeological audience while investigating the link between the pattern of human occupation in Europe during marine isotope stage 3 (MIS 3) (∼25–59 ka) and environmental conditions (

The temporal and spatial scales of the simulated climate data produced by general circulation models (GCMs) and the degree of resolution that could be achieved were sometimes difficult to reconcile with the archaeological data, however, especially since archaeologists lack fine-grained chronological control over much of the archaeological record.
