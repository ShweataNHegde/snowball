<p>Increased computing power, the development of more complex climate models (coupling oceanic, atmospheric, and vegetation dynamics), and advances in computational archaeology have greatly improved the situation. Advances in dating techniques have increased chronological control of the archaeological record (e.g., ref. 
 <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Archaeologists have adopted the use of Geographic Information Systems and modeling tools, which are used to model the dynamic mechanisms underpinning human/environment interactions. Downscaling and regional modeling of simulated climate conditions have increased our ability to model human decision-making at fine spatial and temporal scales (e.g., daily foraging activities). Finally, climate researchers are increasingly aware that tracking human responses to past climate change using the paleoclimate and archaeological records is a means of assessing future climate risks and formulating a sustainable response (
