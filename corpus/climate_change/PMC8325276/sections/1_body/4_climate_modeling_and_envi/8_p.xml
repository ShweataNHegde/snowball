<p>One of the main advantages of using proxy data associated with archaeological remains is that it reduces or eliminates chronological uncertainties between datasets. For example, pedo-sedimentary and archaeological data from Tell Leilan, Syria, allowed researchers to identify the so-called 4.2-ky event and study its human impact (
 <xref rid="r77" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>). This work has since been used to define the middle to late Holocene stratigraphic boundary (
 <xref rid="r78" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>). The last decade has also seen considerable advances in the use of oxygen isotope analyses from archaeological shell middens, which provide data on climate variability at high temporal resolution [e.g., sea surface temperature (SST) (
 <xref rid="r79" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>) and seasonality (
 <xref rid="r80" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>)]. These studies are highly relevant for documenting past environmental–human interactions because they specifically record environmental variables (e.g., SSTs, rainy season length) that directly influence human subsistence, economy, and lifeways. That being said, the spatial distribution of shell midden sites is generally restricted to marine and lacustrine shorelines, and the radiocarbon dating of shells is affected by reservoir effects, meaning that these proxies provide only a “piece of the puzzle” in the paleoclimatologist’s toolkit. In summary, paleoclimatic indicators from ice cores, marine sediment cores, and lake sediments contribute to establishing an environmental context critical for exploring questions pertaining to human evolution and adaptation.
