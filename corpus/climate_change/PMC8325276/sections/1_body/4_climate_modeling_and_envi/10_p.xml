<p>Climate proxy records, most of which rely on biogenic productivity driven by climate- and nonclimate-related parameters, have their own limitations and uncertainties. The predictive capability of numerical models is constrained by the sensitivity of the models to changes in forcings and boundary conditions, and to their ability to represent climate changes at adequate spatial scales, given the specificities of each climate record. Whereas both proxies and models have their respective flaws, the confrontation of proxy data and model simulations contributes to identifying critical components of the climate and environmental system, improving both approaches. Paleoenvironmental data and paleoclimate modeling are shown to be mutually beneficial, and together they enable more accurate reconstructions of past climate events at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, and a better understanding of these recorded climate changes.</p>
