<p>Another challenge related to the integration of paleoclimatic and archaeological datasets involves their spatial association. To what extent are polar ice core records, for example, representative of climate changes that would be relevant for humans living at low and mid-latitudes? Ice core records provide a detailed, long-term frame of reference for past climate conditions: They record surface air temperature at the top of the ice sheets as well as descriptions of naturally globally averaged characteristics such as greenhouse gas concentrations (e.g., ref. 
 <xref rid="r74" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>), and include indicators such as deuterium excess, related to moisture source conditions (e.g., ref. 
 <xref rid="r75" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>). However, they do not inform us about local- to regional-scale climate parameters outside the ice sheets. These are more readily documented by continental paleoenvironmental records, such as pollen, speleothems, or lake records. Archaeological sites also provide a record of regional and local climate signals that are critical for bridging global-scale paleoclimate data and archaeological datasets (e.g., refs. 
 <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and 
 <xref rid="r76" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>) offering detailed insights into paleoclimate change at fine spatial and temporal scales more suitable for investigating human decision making, in addition to producing controls for climate model outputs.
