<p>Climate science has clearly had an impact on how research into the past is conducted. Multidisciplinary, intersectorial research teams are no longer exceptions and the many teams operating today are mature working partnerships. The benefits of these collaborations flow both ways. Climate modelers are interested in collaborating with archaeologists and other natural scientists who, in the course of their fieldwork, accumulate and date a wide range of climate and environment proxies. The pollen and faunal records, for example, make it possible to test model outcomes and adjust model design accordingly (

 <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr"/>
 <xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr"/>–
 <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). This approach, exemplified by the Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Projects (
