<p content-type="flushleft">The archaeology of climate change is an integrated, multidisciplinary approach that incorporates resilience theory and operates within an evolutionary ecological framework. It uses the archaeological record to model human–environment interactions during past climate change events with the goal of identifying the social and ecological “tipping points” that prompt the reorganization of human systems and ecosystems at different scales and rates of change. The archaeological record also allows us to measure the relative success of past adaptative responses. Finally, it provides narrative anchors in contemporary dialogues about climate change that can be used to promote community-based adaptation. The value of adopting a long-range perspective in climate change research is absolutely essential given the scale of climate-driven global environmental transformations that are likely to occur beyond this century (
