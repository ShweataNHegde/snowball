<p>Much work remains to be done, climate variability is expressed in different ways across the landscape, and other sources of stochasticity, such as rates of community succession of both fauna and flora, need to be investigated more fully. More locally oriented research will be required to make climate research accessible and foster community-based responses, including active collaborations with stakeholders beyond academia (

However, the research described above demonstrates the promise and the value of conducting an archaeology of climate change and the benefits that accrue for the participating disciplines within their own spheres of research. While it has always been notoriously difficult to fund multidisciplinary research focused on the past, the situation has been somewhat alleviated recently through the introduction of new funding streams and growing support from within climate research.
