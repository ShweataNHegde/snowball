<p>The use of archaeological models to predict the impact of future climate change on contemporary societies is a relatively new concept that bridges established theories in the social and natural sciences and rests on recognition of the value of adopting a long-range perspective in climate change research. To return to our generalization with respect to stochasticity, in arctic regions where the pattern of sea ice formation is unpredictable, topographic uncertainty limits the ability to plan safe transportation and prevents people from following ancestral tracks across a landscape transformed by climate change (

This, in turn, affects both food security and the network of social interactions and relations to land that rely on human mobility and form an intrinsic part of Inuit culture. Understanding the role of topographic uncertainty in shaping human decisions could prove useful in planning sustainable development in these regions, helping to ensure the continued survival of local communities that contribute to cultural diversity on a global scale.
