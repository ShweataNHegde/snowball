<p>Other sources of stochasticity linked to long-term patterns of climate change have been identified by researchers working within an archaeology of climate change framework. For example, in a context of rapid sea level and ecological change during the last deglaciation, archaeological settlement patterns show that the ancestors of today’s Cree people had a clear preference for topographically stable locations where the impact of landscape transformations linked to climate change was lessened (

Extreme climate events, such as El Niño events, represent another potentially significant source of stochasticity; while their frequency is difficult to predict, archaeological data have been used to date and understand how farming systems in the Southern Hemisphere adapted to them (
