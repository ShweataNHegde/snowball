<p>Thus, in addition to contributing to our understanding of sustainability, the archaeology of climate change demonstrates the role of cultural diversity as a source of human resilience. It also contributes to the protection of biodiversity (

 <xref rid="r127" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>) and ecosystem-based adaptation and community-based adaptation are increasingly seen as complementary approaches (
 <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Indigenous groups have millennia of experience and an intimate knowledge of the land that is critical to planning and enacting sustainable adaptation. Using traditional knowledge, indigenous communities manage healthy, biodiverse ecosystems, providing key services and increasing adaptive capacity (

Several ancient crops have recently been reintroduced into mainstream Western diets, contributing to the diversity of crop types included in the food chain, which is one way of ensuring the resilience of the global food supply under changing climate conditions (
