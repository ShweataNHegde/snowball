<p>The generalization that can be drawn from this research is that human decision-making is shaped by a sensitivity to environmental stochasticity, which is one of the mechanisms through which climate change affects human populations. This generalization has potential applications for understanding the impact of climate change in contemporary situations as it suggests that stochasticity, e.g., the frequency of extreme climate events, may present a bigger challenge than rising temperatures.</p>
