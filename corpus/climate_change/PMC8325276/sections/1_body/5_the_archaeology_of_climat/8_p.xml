<p>Resilience theory, which addresses the dynamics of change in adaptive systems, has an important role to play in the archaeology of climate change. The dynamic interaction of ecological processes and historical contingency—including human action—results in irregular cycles of stability, change, and eventually transformation (

The study of long-term adaptive cycles in the archaeological record has proved a fruitful avenue of research, highlighting continuities, tipping points, and loci of resilience in past socio-ecological systems, from the Pleistocene to the historical past (
