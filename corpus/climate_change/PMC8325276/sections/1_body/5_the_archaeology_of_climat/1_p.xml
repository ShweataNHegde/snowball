<p content-type="flushleft">The increasing availability of high-resolution climatological and ecological reconstructions allows us to study the impact of past climate change on a human scale, one that is relevant to archaeological data and enables the reconstruction of past adaptive responses to specific types of environmental impact, including sea level change, rapid cooling and warming, climatic instability, and prolonged drought (

 <xref rid="r91" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>) have documented, many past adaptations to environmental change were highly successful and could be readapted to modern contexts. A comparative, cross-cultural study of the human past demonstrates that cultural diversity has been, and remains, a key element of human resilience.
