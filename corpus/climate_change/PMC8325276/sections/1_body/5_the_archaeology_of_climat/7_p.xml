<p>Humans, as a species, are thought to be uniquely adapted to dealing with climate variability (

 <xref rid="r106" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>), but human groups differ in their ability to capitalize on the opportunities offered by environmental change and are not equally successful at adapting to change. The archaeological record provides evidence of a diversity of strategies adopted by different human groups in response to climate change and, more to the point, documents their outcomes. A closer look at the regional archaeological record of Southwest Asia, for example, reveals that the transition to farming was not synchronous across the region during the last Glacial/Interglacial cycle and demonstrates that a single climate event can produce very different outcomes as a result of social and geographic factors (
