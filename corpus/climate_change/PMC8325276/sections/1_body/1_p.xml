<p>Climate change and accelerated warming trigger a complex series of biological feedbacks that pose economic and social challenges for human populations. The dramatic transformation of landscapes is already observable in some regions today and is likely to accelerate in the near future. For example, in subarctic regions, species turnover rates are predicted to exceed 80% in protected areas by the end of the century (

Contemporary indigenous communities and small-scale subsistence farmers rely on their relations to the land and access to its natural resources for their economic and cultural reproduction. Despite their integration into capitalist modes of production and the global economy, for example, foraging activities still play an important economic role for many indigenous groups (e.g., ref.
