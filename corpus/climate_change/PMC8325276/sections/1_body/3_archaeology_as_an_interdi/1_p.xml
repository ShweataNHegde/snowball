<p content-type="flushleft">An archaeology of climate change emerges seamlessly from the long-standing collaboration between archaeology and the natural sciences that has provided climatological, environmental, and chronostratigraphic data critical for archaeological interpretations. Since the 19th century, this information has been used to provide a paleoenvironmental backdrop against which past human activities are studied. More recently, it, along with evolutionary theory (specifically evolutionary ecology), has provided a rich, if often implicit conceptual framework with which to study the dynamics of past humanâ€“environment interactions.</p>
