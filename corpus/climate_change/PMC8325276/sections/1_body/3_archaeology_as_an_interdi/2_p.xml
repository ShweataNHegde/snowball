<p>Unfortunately, archaeology and evolutionary theory have been somewhat uneasy bedfellows since the late 20th century, when the postmodernist movement fostered archaeological “post-processualism.” Postprocessualists specifically criticized archaeological research designed to explore human–environment interactions for adopting a deterministic and reductive approach. This research, they contended, assumes that external environmental processes are the principal drivers of cultural transformation while failing to acknowledge the power of historical contingency and denying human agency (

As a result, while it might be relatively uncontroversial to suggest that early hominin adaptations were shaped by natural processes, the suggestion that the more complex cultural adaptations that characterize modern humans might be driven by environmental factors is far from achieving universal acceptance today (
