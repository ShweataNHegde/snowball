<p>For the most part, current public discourse about climate warming revolves around Western, industrialized societies despite the fact that nonindustrialized societies will likely bear the brunt of climate change (

Furthermore, while maintaining biodiversity is one of the goals of climate change research, maintaining cultural diversity does not occupy the same space in public discourse. However, the loss of contemporary cultural diversity could represent an existential threat for our species. Human adaptations are the result of the dynamic relationship between cultural and biological systems. Natural selection operates on biological variation, but the archaeological record shows us that the long-term survival of our species also hinges on our ability to find cultural solutions to environmental challenges. Given the diversity of biomes currently inhabited by humans and the likelihood that they will respond differently to climate change, a range of cultural responses will be required. Cultural diversity, therefore, is the key to long-term human resilience. It is worth reflecting on the future of Western, industrialized economic/social systems and considering the possibility that other forms of social and economic organization may prove more resilient in the long run. Respecting, documenting, and conserving cultural diversity, as well as biodiversity, is therefore an essential step toward building up the resilience of human systems. Because the archaeological record captures the breadth of past human adaptations, the archaeology of climate change is well situated to highlight alternative strategies that have worked in the past and address the social and economic ramifications of global warming for a diverse global community.
