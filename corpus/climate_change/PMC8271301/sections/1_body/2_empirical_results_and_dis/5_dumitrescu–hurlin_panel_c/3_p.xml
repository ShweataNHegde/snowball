<p id="Par37">Regarding climatic conditions, the null hypothesis that temperature does not homogeneously cause food security was refused at a 1% threshold. Similarly, the study discovered that fluctuations in food security significantly led to changes in temperatures across African countries. The results, therefore, imply a bidirectional causality between temperature and food security. Moreover, at a 1% threshold, the null hypothesis that rainfall does not homogeneously affect food security was rejected. This finding implies that rainfall patterns across the countries better predict variations in food security. However, this study established that variations in food security do not homogeneously cause changes in rainfall patterns across countries. Therefore, given the empirical evidence, there is a unidirectional causality running from rainfall to food security in Africa.</p>
