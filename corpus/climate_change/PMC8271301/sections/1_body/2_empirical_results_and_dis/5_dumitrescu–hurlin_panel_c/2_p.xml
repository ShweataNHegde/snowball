<p id="Par36">The empirical findings indicated that the null hypothesis that cultivated areas, GDP per capita, and population growth do not homogeneously cause food security was rejected at a 1% threshold (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). The results indicated that variations in cultivated areas, GDP per capita, and population growth in African countries significantly influenced food security. Additionally, the results disproved the null hypothesis that food security does not homogeneously cause changes in cultivated areas, GDP per capita, and population growth. The findings infer that food security has a causal effect on cultivated areas, GDP per capita, and population growth in the selected African countries. Thus, the empirical findings imply a bidirectional causality between cultivated areas and food security, GDP per capita and food security, and population growth and food security.
