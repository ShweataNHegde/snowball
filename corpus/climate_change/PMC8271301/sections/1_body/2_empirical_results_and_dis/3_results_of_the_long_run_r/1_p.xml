<p id="Par26">This section presents the empirical results for examining the effects of precipitation and temperature, including critical control variables, on Africa’s food security. Evidence from Hausman test statistics (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>) indicates the acceptance of the null hypothesis of homogeneous long-run estimated coefficients when analysed at a 95% confidence interval. This finding implies that estimates from the PMG technique are more consistent and precise than the MG computations. Thus, the PMG approach is more suitable for the present study as it accounts for short-run heterogeneity in estimations (Pesaran et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">1999</xref>). Therefore, our discussion focused on the PMG results of the long-run relationship (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). We later deployed the ARDL approach for time-series datasets to examine the long-run heterogeneous impacts of climate change on selected African countries’ food security (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>).
