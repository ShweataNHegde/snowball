<p id="Par29">In some regions, rapid population growth and poverty threaten food security (Asian Development Bank,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2004</xref>; Yang &amp; Hanson, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2009</xref>). However, our evidence indicates that population growth (LnPOP) exerts a positive and significant influence on food security in Africa (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). At the country level, our results suggest that rising population growth positively influences food security in Algeria (0.831), Burkina Faso (0.964), Cameroon (0.682), Cote dâ€™Ivoire (1.617), Kenya (0.484), Mali (2.053), Nigeria (0.719), Sierra Leone (0.419), South Africa (1.037), Tunisia (1.128), and Zambia (1.014) in the long run. Thus, the rise in population growth does not impede efforts to promote food security in Africa. The reason is that the current policies adopted by various governments in Africa to promote financial inclusion, coupled with improved disease-resistant varieties of staple crops and reduced land degradation, have imposed favourable impacts on food production. These interventions have allowed food production to remain slightly ahead of population growth.
