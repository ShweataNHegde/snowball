<p id="Par30">Regarding critical variables, temperature (LnTEMP) did not appear to significantly influence food security when examined at standard 1% to 10% significance levels. The study found that the long-run impact of temperature on food security at the regional level was akin to its effects at the country level. Our findings indicate that temperature has a negligible influence on food security in many countries. However, it has either a negative or positive impact on food security in some countries. For instance, the results exhibit a significant negative relationship between temperature and food security in the long term—Egypt (− 4.388), Ghana (− 6.174), Mali (− 3.574), South Africa (− 5.030), and Tunisia (− 5.298). On the other hands, the temperature has a positive impact on food security in Nigeria (6.525) and the Gambia (17.834) in the long run.</p>
