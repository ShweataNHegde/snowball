<p id="Par28">LnGDPPC entered the regression with a significant positive coefficient, suggesting that per capita income supports food security. The long-run impact of GDP per capita on food security at the regional level reflects its effects at the country level. Of the 15 selected countries, GDP per capita directly influenced food security in 8 countries in the long run—Cameroon (0.932), Egypt (0.438), Ghana (0.491), Morocco (1.351), Sierra Leone (0.703), South Africa (1.768), the Gambia (1.491), and Tunisia (0.441). Factors on both the demand and supply sides can explain this outcome. From the demand side, analysis of the income-consumption-production model in Africa suggests that the growth in GDP per capita significantly induces the region’s demand for agricultural output. However, as the proportion of consumer spending on food declines with income growth (Fukase &amp; Martin, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2017</xref>), Africa’s food demand will increase if rising income drives consumers’ purchasing power and food security. From the supply side, both productivity and income growth strongly influence food production.
