<p id="Par27">The positive and significant coefficient of LnCULA suggests that cultivated land under cereal production has improved food security in Africa. Out of the 15 selected countries, 14 reported a significant direct association between cropped areas and food security in the long runâ€”Algeria (1.349), Burkina Faso (0.922), Cameroon (0.617), Egypt (0.693), Ghana (2.094), Kenya (1.006), Mali (0.290), Morocco (2.299), Nigeria (0.513), Sierra Leone (1.093), South Africa (0.946), the Gambia (0.897), Tunisia (0.559), and Zambia (0.757). Indeed, most African economies are driven by the agricultural sector. Nevertheless, low agricultural production in the region results from inadequate farmland access, especially for rural communities. In line with Dogliotti et al. (
