<p id="Par31">In contrast to temperature, rainfall patterns have a substantial impact on Africa’s food security. Specifically, the estimated coefficient of rainfall (LnRAIN) was positive and statistically significant at the 1% level in the long run. The magnitude and significance of precipitation’s effect, on the other hands, differ across countries. As most African countries depend on rainfall for farming activities, food security and productivity may be particularly vulnerable to reduced rainfall conditions (Akinbile et al.,
