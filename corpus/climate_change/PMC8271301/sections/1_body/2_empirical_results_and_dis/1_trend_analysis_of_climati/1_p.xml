<p id="Par23">The present study established significant positive trends in temperature in selected African countries between 1970 and 2015 (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In Algeria, Egypt, and Tunisia, the average annual temperature exhibited significant and increasing trends with corresponding 
 <italic>Z</italic> values of 2.14, 2.14, and 2.34. In addition, except in January and February, the average temperature in Algeria, Egypt, and Tunisia displayed a significant positive trend across the months. Moreover, the annual temperature increased significantly in Cameroon, Cote d’Ivoire, and Ghana, with 
 <italic>Z</italic> values of 3.08, 3.45, and 2.75, respectively. We detected a significant upward trend in temperature on a monthly scale; however, there were no notable temperature trends detected for January in Cameroon, Cote d’Ivoire, or Ghana. Monthly and annual average temperature data exhibited a significant upward trend in Kenya and the Gambia. Similarly, the average annual temperatures in Burkina Faso, Mali, Morocco, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, South Africa, and Zambia showed significant rising trends, given 
 <italic>Z</italic> values of 2.67, 2.14, 2.22, 2.30, 2.51, 2.63, and 2.46, which are higher than

The results again indicated a significant positive trend in monthly temperature except for January and August in Burkina Faso; January, February, August, and September in Mali; January, February, May, August, September, and November in Morocco; January in Nigeria; January and December in Sierra Leone; April, June, and November in South Africa; and April in Zambia.
