<p id="Par25">The study used the LLC, IPS, and ADF stationarity tests. The results of these panel unit root tests revealed that cultivated area, population growth, temperature, rainfall, and food security were stationary at their levels, thereby being integrated of order zero [i.e. 
 <italic>I</italic>(
 <italic>0</italic>)] (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). However, GDP per capita was stationary at its first difference, suggesting that GDP per capita is integrated of order one (i.e. 
 <italic>I</italic>(
 <italic>1</italic>)). These outcomes ensure the suitability of applying the panel ARDL approach for investigating climate change implications for Africaâ€™s food security.
