<p id="Par10">In this study, we collated annual panel data on 15 countries across Africa for 1970–2016. We chose countries based on their history of food insecurity and food emergencies and their significant economic contribution to Africa’s growth. The selected countries were Algeria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cote d’Ivoire, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Morocco, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, South Africa, the Gambia, Tunisia, and Zambia. The data on population growth, GDP per capita, cultivated land under cereal production, temperature, and rainfall were extracted from the World Bank (
