<p id="Par6">Third, the susceptibility of the African continent to climate change requires desperate implementation of adaptation measures. Global attempts to curb climate change and its subsequent consequences have produced little benefit across Africa (Antwi-Agyei, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2012</xref>). Disasters, conflicts; ecosystem degradation; limited access to infrastructure, capital, markets, and technology; and climate change impacts currently inhibit food productivity across the continent (Boko et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2007</xref>; van den Bos Verma et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2020</xref>). Even though Africa commands approximately 60% of the world’s uncultivated arable land, the continent contributes only 10% to world food production (Elbehri, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2015</xref>). The severity of the low productivity situation is exacerbated by a reduced workforce in commercial farming, combined with the expected rapid population growth (Ribaudo et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2011</xref>). Given Africa’s constant struggle with hunger and famine, this raises concerns about the role of climate change in food security. The impact of climate change on agricultural production is a significant point of contention due to marginal environmental conditions in many countries in Africa, scarce resources for adaptation, and subsistence livelihoods (FAO, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2005</xref>). Thompson et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2010</xref>) stated that climate change is an imminent possibility for Africa, but there is no need for food insecurity. However, mitigating food insecurity in Africa requires the implementation of multi-country policy strategies.
