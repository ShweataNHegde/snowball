<p id="Par7">Following the above discussion, we provided new empirical evidence on the impact of climate change on food security in Africa. In this study, our objective was to assess the impacts of climate change on food security in 15 selected African countries, namely Algeria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cote dâ€™Ivoire, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Morocco, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, South Africa, The Gambia, Tunisia, and Zambia. This study sought to answer three key questions. (1) What are the actual trends in climatic variability in these African countries? (2) What are the impacts of climate change on food security? (3) What is the causal relationship between climate change and food security?</p>
