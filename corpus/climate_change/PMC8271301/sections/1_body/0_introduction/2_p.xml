<p id="Par3">Recent evidence reveals an alarming rise in global hunger and undernourishment, alongside increasingly extreme climatic conditions. Approximately 690 million people went hungry in 2019, and this figure is expected to rise by 60 million people in the next five years (FAO et al

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2020</xref>). These sobering figures raise the question: can we still achieve the Sustainable Development Goals of eradicating hunger by 2030? (United Nations, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2015</xref>). While policy consensus is required to mitigate the prevailing symptoms of food insecurity, the underlying drivers of global food insecurity remain complex and inconclusive (Amekudzi et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2015</xref>; Chauhan et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020</xref>; Hossain et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2019</xref>; Owusu et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2021</xref>). A plethora of studies associates hunger with changing farming activities imposed by the cumulative effects of climate change on all dimensions of food security—food access, availability, stability, and utilisation—across regions (Easterling et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2000</xref>; FAO, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2010</xref>; FAO et al
 <italic>.,</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2019</xref>; Hossain et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2019</xref>; McCarthy et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2001</xref>). For instance, extreme climate change and variability will decrease crop output in some African countries by up to 50% by 2030, while crop income may decline by 90% by 2100 (Boko et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2007</xref>). Other studies suggest that climate change has already led to a decline in food security at national and household levels in developing countries (Connolly-Boutin &amp; Smith, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2016</xref>; Nelson et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2009</xref>; Thornton et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2011</xref>). Climate change and variability could adversely affect Africa’s food security in several ways (Boko et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2007</xref>; Kotir, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2011</xref>; Schlenker &amp; Lobell, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2010</xref>; Thornton et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2011</xref>; Yobom, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2020</xref>). First, climate extremes may influence the supply of food in Africa by reducing the area of viable arable land suitable for crop production (Amekudzi et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2015</xref>; Arnell, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2009</xref>; Owusu et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2021</xref>), leading to a surge in the prevalence and number of undernourished people. Second, a rise in temperature by 4 °C or more may have disastrous effects on many farmers’ livelihoods in Africa (Thornton et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2011</xref>). Such a climate event may require higher productivity and more efficient distribution of resources to eradicate hunger across the continent. Brown et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2007</xref>) and Amekudzi et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2015</xref>) identified climate change as a new security threat to Africa. Further, Burke et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2009</xref>) attributed increased civil wars to climate change and detected a strong association between warmer years and past civil wars. Despite many studies conducted to examine the overall impact of climate change on food security in developing countries, evidence on the effects of climate change on food productivity remains inconclusive.
