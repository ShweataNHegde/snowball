<p id="Par2">The role of climate change in economic growth has dominated global policy discussions for many decades (Berrera &amp; Hertel,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2019</xref>; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2001</xref>). Development practitioners and policymakers describe frequent climate variability as a menace and an obstacle to sustainable global growth and development (Boko et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2007</xref>; Murphy &amp; Drexhage, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2010</xref>). Despite these concerns, evidence shows that climate change has become more severe, and the drivers of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, ozone, and nitrous oxide, are still on the rise, even with the global slowdown resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic (World Meteorological Organization, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2020</xref>). While a comprehensive assessment of the risks associated with changing climatic conditions remains controversial (McCarl et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2013</xref>), a growing number of studies examining the effects of climate change argue that upsurging greenhouse gases increase atmospheric temperatures, create extreme weather events, and threaten food production, especially in regions that depend extensively on rain-fed farming (Mendelsohn &amp; Wang, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2017</xref>; Sigh &amp; Thadani, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2015</xref>; Yobom, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2020</xref>). Thus, the relative effect of climate change on food security will be much higher in developing countries if it persists.
