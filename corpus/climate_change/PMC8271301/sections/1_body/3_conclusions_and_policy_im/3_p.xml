<p id="Par40">These findings have numerous policy implications. First, because rainfall plays a crucial role in Africa’s food security, an intervention to reduce the risk of rain-fed farm production is critical, given the extreme variability of rainfall patterns across the continent. Such intervention must involve establishing irrigation infrastructure to assist farmers, especially those in rural areas.

More importantly, further research on the subject must incorporate other dimensions of food security, such as food accessibility, food utilisation, and food stability, to present a broader picture of food security across Africa.
