<p id="Par38">Extreme weather conditions are among the key factors influencing food security in Africa. Temperature variations have imposed numerous repercussions on the continent’s food production as most African economies rely on rainfall for agricultural production. Given the lack of consensus about the actual impact of climate change on food security in Africa, this study examined the roles of rainfall and temperature patterns in food security at the regional level and across countries. Trend analyses of climatic variability detected that the annual average temperature rose significantly between 1970 and 2015 in Africa. Conversely, we did not find significant annual average rainfall trends in most countries, except for Burkina Faso, Mali, and the Gambia. However, on examination of the food security model that accounted for climate change and other control variables, rainfall was found to play a decisive role in Africa’s food security in the long run.</p>
