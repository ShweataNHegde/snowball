<p id="Par39">On the other hands, we did not detect robust evidence that temperature influences food security in Africa in the long run. In the short run, temperature was found to impede food security, whereas rainfall was positively associated with food security. Intriguingly, these climatic conditions had an inconclusive impact on food security overall as their effects varied dramatically among countries when we evaluated magnitude and direction. The study further indicated that a bidirectional causality exists between food security and temperature, cultivated areas and food security, GDP per capita and food security, and population growth and food security. However, the causality between rainfall and food security is unidirectional, with rainfall affecting food security but not vice versa.</p>
