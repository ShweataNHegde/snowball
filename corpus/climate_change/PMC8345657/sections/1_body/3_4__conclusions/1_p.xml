<p>In summary, there is a policy window in the U.S. to advance the science on climate change and health, while centering equity in this work. Several critical questions and uncertainties remain to better understand and help prevent or reduce the health risks associated with climate change, and to better understand the effectiveness of different intervention strategies. The current focus on acute health effects from weather events limits our ability to understand longer-term, population-level health impacts and adaptive change. Large uncertainties in the estimates of the health impacts of climate change exist because of the dearth of research evaluations on a range of adaptation strategies, perhaps somewhat attributable to the diffuse nature of adaptation. Mitigation and adaptation strategies interact to reduce the health impacts of climate change, yet few studies have integrated the analysis of combined strategies. Such studies are critical given the sometimes-conflicting goals and spatial and temporal differences between these two approaches. These gaps in knowledge make it even more difficult for decision-makers to act on climate change despite the large toll that climate-sensitive health risks have taken to date and will continue to take in the future. Research that provides evidence to close such gaps can help policymakers weigh the costs and benefits of interventions and develop clear targets and measures of accountability for climate mitigation and adaptation. </p>
