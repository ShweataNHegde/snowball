<p>Despite these gaps, there are tools and methodologies that climate and health researchers have yet to fully harness. Future epidemiologic studies should focus on climate-sensitive outcomes that have been less studied and incorporate economic valuation. Researchers should collect longitudinal data related to climate variability and health outcomes in specific locations and use quasi-experimental and other rigorous study designs to evaluate the effectiveness of intervention strategies and characterize the uncertainty in those estimates. Climate change and health researchers may benefit from applying detection and attribution analysis to better quantify the benefits of mitigation actions. Decision analysis frameworks have been applied to the evaluation of climate change mitigation and adaptation but not specifically to their health impacts. Decision analysis methods such as MCDA and RDM, combined with systems approaches, can provide more robust information for decision-makers who must weigh the uncertainties in climate-sensitive health risk projection and its multi-sector interdependence when considering policy options. Lastly, public engagement methods such as community-partnered research and citizen science provide fresh approaches to understanding and addressing health risks associated with climate change. They are crucial to aid policymakers in understanding the most equitable ways to minimize the health risks of climate change. </p>
