<p>To minimize knowledge gaps, federal policy needs to ensure that there is a comprehensive strategy to drive a climate change and health research agenda and adequate resources to sustain it. Without federal policy that increases funding directed toward this effort, coordinates resources and activities, and continues to build capacity, research will remain stymied. We encourage the public health policy and research community to take advantage of this opportunity to advance the state of research by prioritizing the application of the methods and tools discussed here to climate change and health. Doing so may provide critical knowledge to further motivate and improve public health-related policies on climate change.</p>
