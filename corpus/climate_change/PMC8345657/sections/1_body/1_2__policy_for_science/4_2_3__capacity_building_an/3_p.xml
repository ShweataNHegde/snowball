<p>In addition to building capacity within the U.S., public health capacity-building for climate change outside of U.S. borders will be of primary importance in the future. Health assessment research does not regularly consider negative externalities of non-U.S. disease burden beyond countries that share physical borders, economic interdependencies, national policies, and programs to mitigate or adapt to climate change effects that are not funded by U.S. development agencies, or the robust research on climate change and health conducted outside of the U.S. In order to effectively combat health inequity and transform resilience both within the U.S. and globally, international coordination is critical for identifying the distribution of risks and disease-burden, as well as sharing experience of effective adaptation and mitigation [
