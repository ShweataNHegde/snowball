<p>Research to characterize the full range of climate change-related health impacts has been limited by fragmented and inconsistent data and health surveillance systems across the country. While multiple efforts have been made to strengthen the capacity of public health surveillance systems to support health-related adaptation to climate change at the federal, state, and local levels, these efforts have largely operated independent from one another, without the benefit of a shared strategy [

Further, data on exposure to climate hazards vary in their precision, accuracy, and availability to health professionals, necessitating cross-sector partnerships with other scientists, practitioners, and members of the public [

Data coordination and the promotion of open data and science could engender trust and expand opportunities for more researchers to engage with the creation, utilization, and exchange of datasets used to support a climate change and health research agenda.
