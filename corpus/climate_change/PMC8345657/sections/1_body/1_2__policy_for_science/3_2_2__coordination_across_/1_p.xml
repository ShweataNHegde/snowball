<p>A long-standing challenge for orienting federal investments in research toward the needs of decision-makers has been coordination among the various research agencies. Since 1990, the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) has been the primary vehicle for interagency coordination on climate research. This includes research on the health impacts of climate change, spanning efforts funded by specific agencies as well as more synthetic scientific assessments sponsored by the USGCRP (e.g., [

 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-18-07868" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Population health was specifically identified as one such urgent risk. Moreover, the report recommended organizational changes to USGCRP to (a) enhance agencies’ level of engagement in the program, (b) encourage greater participation of agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security that historically have not participated in USGCRP, and (c) develop public–private partnerships in support of climate change research and science-to-action activities.
