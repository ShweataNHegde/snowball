<p>Even within the population health and biomedical communities, research efforts are often siloed. Rather than looking at the totality of population health, biomedical research (and funding) is often categorized by the organ system that is affected (e.g., diseases of the respiratory system, cardiovascular system). Recognizing the fault in this framework when dealing with a systemic problem like climate change, with multiple health endpoints, a Trans-NIH Working Group on Climate Change and Health was established over a decade ago.

Establishing an Office of Climate Change and Health Equity within HHS would do the same across the entire family of health agencies in the U.S. federal government and provide a much-needed coordinating body to bolster this effort of cross-system thinking within health research, practice, and policy.
