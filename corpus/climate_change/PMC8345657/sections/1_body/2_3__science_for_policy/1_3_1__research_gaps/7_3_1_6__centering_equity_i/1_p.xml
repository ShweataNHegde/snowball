<p>It is well known that the health impacts of climate change affect different populations differently and the largest burden has fallen on marginalized communities, both within the U.S. and around the world. In the U.S., evidence has shown a higher burden of climate-sensitive outcomes in communities of color and low-income populations. Like most of the public health literature, studies of climate change and health have relied on simple demographic descriptors, including race, to assess which populations are most at risk. However, there is a growing call within research and practice to recognize that race is a social construct and that the continued use of this construct obfuscates the role of racism in determining health [

A serious examination of racism as an explanation for racial disparities is particularly relevant for climate-sensitive health outcomes because of the interactions between policies and social, natural, and built environmental systems that result in unequal environmental burdens for diverse populations [
