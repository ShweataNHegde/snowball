 <xref rid="B68-ijerph-18-07868" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], there are few examples of integrated analyses of mitigation and adaptation strategies. In some cases, these can lead to explicit tradeoffs [
 <xref rid="B69-ijerph-18-07868" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. For example, the most effective adaptation strategy for preventing heat-related morbidity and mortality is to increase access to air conditioning [
 <xref rid="B57-ijerph-18-07868" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. However, without sufficient renewable electricity generation, such a strategy will result in an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, directly conflicting with mitigation goals.
