<p>The complexity in addressing mitigation and adaptation in an integrated way is driven, in part, by different temporal and spatial scales. While adaptation strategies are typically more focused on the near-term (years to decades), mitigation actions focus primarily on longer-term solutions (decades to centuries). In addition, adaptation is implemented on a local scale with a local impact, while mitigation strategies are intended to have a global impact and are more likely to be implemented at national and international scales. Nonetheless, the downstream effects of mitigation and adaptation can interact with each other regardless of the level at which they are implemented [

Identifying the right balance of mitigation and adaptation strategies will depend on methodological tools that can incorporate long and short time-horizons, as well as systems frameworks, into the evaluation of alternative policies. A recently developed conceptual framework [
