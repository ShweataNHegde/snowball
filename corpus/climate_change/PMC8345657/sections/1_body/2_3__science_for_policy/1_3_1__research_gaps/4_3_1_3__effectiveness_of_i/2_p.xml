<p>Empirical evidence on the effectiveness of specific intervention strategies for adaptation is needed to project future health impacts of weather events and help decision-makers assess alternative policy options [

 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-18-07868" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Such evidence, to date, has been limited by the narrow scope of strategies assessed (e.g., heat adaptation plans and alerts for extreme heat events) [

 <xref rid="B39-ijerph-18-07868" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], methodologies not adequate to infer causal effects [
 <xref rid="B40-ijerph-18-07868" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and an incomplete accounting for the full range of health co-benefits that could result [
 <xref rid="B41-ijerph-18-07868" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. A systematic review of the effectiveness of heat adaptation strategies, for example, noted that most studies focused on community heat warning systems, with limited or no attention to other measures such as air conditioning or infrastructure enhancements such as green infrastructure or white roofs [
 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-18-07868" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Relatively few studies have evaluated and compared the effectiveness of the wide range of interventions that have the potential to blunt the adverse health impacts of extreme weather and climate variability, even though this is precisely the type of information that decision-makers need to make investment decisions [
 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-18-07868" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The lack of studies on effectiveness can partially be explained by limitations in the availability of spatially and temporally resolved health outcome data that would be necessary to evaluate adaptation interventions for their health effects. However, with more and more locales enacting policies and interventions to address climate change and with data to estimate spatially resolved weather patterns becoming increasingly available, evaluations (which include an assessment of health impacts and co-benefits) should be prioritized as part of their implementation.
