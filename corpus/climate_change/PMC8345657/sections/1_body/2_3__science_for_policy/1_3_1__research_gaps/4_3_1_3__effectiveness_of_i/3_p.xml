<p>Even when empirical evidence on interventions is available, more rigorous evaluation is needed. Many prior studies have relied upon descriptive preâ€“post approaches (e.g., comparing deaths on extreme weather days before and after the implementation of a specific intervention), which cannot adequately account for confounding due to socioeconomic factors or secular healthcare, demographics, and mobility trends [

 <xref rid="B44-ijerph-18-07868" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], many studies have focused on the health co-benefits of mitigation [

 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-18-07868" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]; however, few studies have examined the health co-benefits of adaptive intervention strategies [
 <xref rid="B41-ijerph-18-07868" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. For example, when urban green spaces have been assessed for their ability to combat the heat island effect [
 <xref rid="B47-ijerph-18-07868" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], their total health benefits and co-benefits (e.g., an increase in physical activity of nearby residents) have not been captured systematically. Pursuing rigorous assessment of co-benefits could help lead to improved, evidence-based adaptation strategies.
