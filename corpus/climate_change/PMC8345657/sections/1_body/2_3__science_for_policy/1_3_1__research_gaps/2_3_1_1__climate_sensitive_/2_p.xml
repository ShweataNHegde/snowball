<p>Although a large body of evidence has accumulated estimating the exposureâ€“response relationship between weather events and some health outcomes, others have been less studied. For example, mental health effects (e.g., suicidality, anxiety, or major depressive episodes) that can occur after population displacement from extreme weather events, as well as neurotoxic effects of air pollution and, more broadly, health effects from air pollution specific to wildfires, which may be different than the impacts that result from air pollution from industrial or mobile sources, are areas where further research is still needed. Further, much of the research to date on climate-sensitive health outcomes has been conducted in adult populations, but there is growing evidence of a wide range of impacts on children, which deserves further attention [
