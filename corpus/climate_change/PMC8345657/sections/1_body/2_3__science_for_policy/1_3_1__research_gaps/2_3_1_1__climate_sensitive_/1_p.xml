<p>Projecting how climate change will either exacerbate existing health threats or give rise to new ones can inform decision-making for public health policy priorities [

The Fourth National Climate Assessment, for example, summarizes climate-sensitive health outcomes including increased mortality and injury from more frequent and severe weather-related events and temperature extremes; more respiratory, cardiovascular, and allergic reactions arising from worsening indoor and outdoor air quality; more vector-borne diseases due to changing vector ecology (and footprint) brought about by rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns; mental health consequences resulting from severe weather-related events (e.g., hurricanes) or prolonged climate patterns (e.g., drought); and compromised nutritional status due to greater food insecurity arising from the effects of rising global temperatures on crop productivity and food distribution systems [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-18-07868" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Evidence for these effects is based on research using data on the “baseline” incidence or prevalence of relevant health conditions, the expected change in weather exposure due to climate change, and the exposure–response function based on historical effects of weather [
 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-18-07868" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The empirical evidence to support these exposure–response relationships is greater for some health outcomes than for others, constraining our ability to project future impacts across the entire spectrum of health outcomes. Therefore, the first data gap we note relates to the breadth of climate-sensitive health outcomes that have been the focus of research.
