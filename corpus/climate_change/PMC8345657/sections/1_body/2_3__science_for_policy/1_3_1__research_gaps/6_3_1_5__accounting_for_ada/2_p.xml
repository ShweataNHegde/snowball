<p>Increasing the accuracy of long-term projections of climate-sensitive health outcomes requires proper attribution of the health effects that are due to long-term climate change and the incorporation of autonomous and planned adaptation (and maladaptation) into the analyses to the extent possible [
 <xref rid="B55-ijerph-18-07868" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. To date, there have been limited attempts to do so through statistical approximations, with little empirical evidence to confirm the magnitude of adaptive response in these assumptions [
 <xref rid="B56-ijerph-18-07868" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. A partial solution would entail evaluating autonomous adaptation and relying on assumptions for acclimatization or behavior changes. A better solution would be to use empirical evidence (obtained from intervention effectiveness studies described in the previous section) to improve assessments of planned adaptation; however, to date, such data have been limited or non-existent [
 <xref rid="B41-ijerph-18-07868" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. For example, declines in heat sensitivity have been attributed to the increased prevalence of air conditioning, the introduction of heat warning systems, and longer life expectancies due to socio-economic development and epidemiologic transitions, among others. However, with few exceptions [
 <xref rid="B57-ijerph-18-07868" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], there has been almost no direct analysis to quantify the intervention effectiveness of these specific measures. Beyond effectiveness, to date there have been no systemic empirical analyses that we know of which look at the affordability and availability of adaptation interventions, and consequently their implications for inequities in climate-sensitive disease burden over the long term.
