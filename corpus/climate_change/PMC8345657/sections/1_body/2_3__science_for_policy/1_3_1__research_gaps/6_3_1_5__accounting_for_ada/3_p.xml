<p>Due to the diffuse and context-specific nature of mitigation and adaptation, there will also continue to be a large degree of uncertainty associated with any given strategy to project health impacts, even with an accumulation of empirical data. Remais and colleagues, for example, have discussed the following uncertainties when modeling health co-benefits of emissions-related mitigation activities that are also relevant when evaluating adaptation strategies: (1) spatial and temporal changes in health-relevant exposures; (2) the time response of the health effects due to exposure changes; (3) alternative interventions in terms of their health effects across populations and time scales; and (4) the assumed time course of future disease-specific burdens in the absence of intervention [

Therefore, it is essential that any evaluation of the health effects of long-term climate change include an explicit characterization of uncertainty, particularly as many long-term trends—frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, frequency of compounding events, and susceptibility and resilience of populations—continue to evolve [
