<p>Even in studies that have examined long-term data series, critics have noted a failure to adequately account for long-term population-level adaptation [
 <xref rid="B50-ijerph-18-07868" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Astrom and colleagues investigated heat-related mortality in Stockholm during two periods, 1900–1929 and 1980–2009, and concluded that mortality rates in the latter period were double what would have been observed in the absence of climate change [
 <xref rid="B32-ijerph-18-07868" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, others have argued that had population heat sensitivity remained constant (i.e., absent an adaptation response or increase in population resilience due to favorable health and socioeconomic development), the effect would have been much larger [
 <xref rid="B50-ijerph-18-07868" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. A limited number of studies that have been able to examine mortality data over decades have reported a decline in heat sensitivity [

 <xref rid="B52-ijerph-18-07868" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. However, as Hondula and colleagues conclude in their review of the literature, this stands in contrast to the projection-based body of literature, which predicts a substantial increase in heat-related mortality in the future [
 <xref rid="B53-ijerph-18-07868" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Further, many projections that leverage long-term data series do not acknowledge the potential for threshold effects, whereby sensitivity can be latent or even be exacerbated after a given threshold (e.g., heat-related morbidity would be sensitive to a wet-bulb temperature of 35 °C) [
