<p>Severe weather events (e.g., heat waves, hurricanes) often occur as initial shocks, which subsequently affect morbidity and mortality. The current literature, which has relied on exposure–response relationships from historical data, has made an important contribution by enumerating and quantifying a range of health effects from these types of acute events. However, it is important to note that most studies to date have not fully addressed the health impacts of long-term climate stressors—for example, the effects of gradually rising temperatures associated with climate change. The distinction between acute weather events and gradual climate change is an important one. On one hand, the frequency of short-term events may make them relevant to long-term projections that predict increased frequency. On the other hand, short averaging periods that describe only acute incidents may not reflect systemic responses to long-term change, nor can they account for either autonomous (e.g., physiologic acclimatization or behavioral changes) or planned (e.g., heat health warning systems) population adaptation [

Assessing the effects of long-term change requires complete, longitudinal datasets that permit observations of changes in both risk of exposure and health outcomes, as well as models that can project plausible future climate changes and associated impacts across appropriate time horizons and geographic scales. Though often not available, such data could also facilitate the understanding of risk from compound climate events, which would help to better characterize the potential effects of such high-impact events [
