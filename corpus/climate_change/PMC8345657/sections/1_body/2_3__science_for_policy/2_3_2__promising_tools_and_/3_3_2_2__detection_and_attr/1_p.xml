<p>Detection and attribution analyses permit an understanding of the role of climate change in current extreme weather events. The research community recognizes the importance of this type of work in building the evidence base for climate risk management and to inform accurate projections of how the health effects of climate change can be minimized through climate mitigation. To date, however, there have been very few examples of detection and attribution methods applied to health research [

Although detection and attribution methods have been rarely applied to health research, and approaches vary widely, early case studies demonstrate their suitability and indicate that they will likely play an important role in the next phase of climate change and health research.
