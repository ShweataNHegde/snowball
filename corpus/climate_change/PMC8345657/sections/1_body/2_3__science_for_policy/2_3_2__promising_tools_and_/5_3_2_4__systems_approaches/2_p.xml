<p>Moreover, a systems approach can aid our understanding of system implications and the risk of unintended consequences that may occur when integrating mitigation and adaptation strategies [

 <xref rid="B82-ijerph-18-07868" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] argue for is an urban systems approach that improves upon traditional risk assessment based on spatial analysis and climate projections. Urban systems approaches can be applied to health risks to estimate how a cityâ€™s public health, emergency management, infrastructure, and vulnerable socio-demographic groups behave and fluctuate as a complex system across multiple temporal and spatial scales in the face of short-term and long-term climate change effects and therefore how to best prepare for them. Systems analysis and complexity studies can be leveraged to demonstrate how structural factors such as technology and equity of information contribute to differential levels of environmental exposure, and how these dimensions may impede or advance climate change and health policy goals [
