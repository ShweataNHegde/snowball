<p>Climate change, like other complex public health problems, is socially complex and difficult to define, has local and global impacts, and requires interdisciplinary solutions [

The basic tenets of complex systems theory, such as non-linearity, adaptiveness, and connectivity, make it well-suited to apply to climate change and health, which must account for dynamic context influencing operations, as well as interactions among system components including the natural environment, infrastructure, economic and social behavior patterns, human subpopulation effects [
