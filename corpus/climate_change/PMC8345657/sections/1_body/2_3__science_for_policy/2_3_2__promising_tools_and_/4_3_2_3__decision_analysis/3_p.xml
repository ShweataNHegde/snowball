<p>Robust decision-making (RDM) is a methodology for decision-making under deep uncertainty (DMDU) that allows stakeholders to consider necessary trade-offs in allocating resources across a broad portfolio of potential interventions. Although quantitative analysis is needed for sound policy decisions, traditional quantitative analysis provides information about the future by making predictions. Since predictions can be wrong, and decision-makers are aware of that reality, quantitative analysis can be discounted. Instead of using models and data to predict the future, the RDM methodology runs models on hundreds to thousands of different sets of assumptions to describe how plans perform in a range of possible futures. Visualization and statistical analysis of the resulting model outputs help decision-makers understand future conditions under which their plans perform well and those under which their plans perform poorly, guiding them to make their plans more robust [

RDM has been applied to a wide variety of policy areas, including resource planning for climate adaptation, coastal resilience planning, and national security. Common uses of RDM for these topical areas include prioritizing policies across time, ranking policies by cost effectiveness, ranking policies by alternative criteria, and understanding complementarities and substitutability (i.e., tradeoffs) across policies. Due to the deep uncertainty associated with the public health impacts and appropriate responses to climate change, RDM is uniquely suited to tackle this challenge.
