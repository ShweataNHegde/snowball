<p>Multi criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is a quantitative method that can be used to rate and compare alternative options against a range of criteria. This can take the form of subject matter experts and decision-makers who subjectively rate all options as well as a median, lower, and upper quartile for each rating in order to inform distribution functions for each of the ratings. MCDA involves the formulation of the problem statement (including the definition of decision options and criteria), building an evidence matrix per criterion, determining the relative importance (weighting) of each criterion and the integration of the evidence matrix and weighting to determine an overall score. The benefit of using MCDA to support public environmental health decision-making has been demonstrated in the context of MCDA to evaluate the impact of different types of interventions to reduce the health burden of four different environmental health hazards, ranging from vehicle emission controls to reduce ambient air pollutants to encouraging active transport and increasing access to green spaces [
