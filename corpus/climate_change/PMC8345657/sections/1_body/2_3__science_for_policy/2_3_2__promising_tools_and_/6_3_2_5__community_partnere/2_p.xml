<p>Citizen science, or scientific research that is conducted in whole or in part by nonprofessional scientists, has become increasingly popular in the last few years. Similar to community-partnered research, citizen science supports local residents to engage in scientific research activities, with levels of engagement ranging from leading the initiative and asking the research questions, to supporting more traditional academic research initiatives by supporting and contributing to data collection [

The internet, mobile technology, and geographic information systems have enabled citizen scientists to collect large volumes of useful data and have contributed to the increased use of citizen science in a wide variety of scientific endeavors. For example, citizen science has commonly been used to enhance public health emergency preparedness during and following extreme weather events [

Despite the rise in citizen participation in policy research, the full potential of citizen science has not been fully realized because of challenges related to the translation and use of the data, the sustainability of citizen science efforts, as well as data quality concerns [

Critical to improving equity in climate and health plans, an additional concern is that citizen science participants may not necessarily reflect the broader population, therefore inadvertently exacerbating inequities in climate change agenda-setting [

Further research is needed to determine how citizen science can optimally be used to help populations mitigate and adapt to the health risks of climate change, as well as ways to include disproportionately affected communities in constructing and executing their own locally relevant research agenda.
