<p>Engagement with stakeholders, including policymakers, health professionals, and the public, is a critical part of preparing for and responding to the health risks generated by climate change. Most crucially, place-based and community-partnered research works to ensure the co-development of climate change policy goals for (often disproportionately) affected populations [

Community-partnered research, when applied correctly, often requires that researchers and community members design and validate research and programming to ensure local relevance, feasibility, and that the proposed approaches are desired by and in line with local communities. Consequently, when research is not community-partnered, the unintended consequences could include low levels of buy-in, misappropriation of resources to not address local issues of priority, disillusionment or skepticism in research, or non-compliance where benefits to communities are not immediately evident. When communities drive their own research agenda and stakeholders facilitate and elevate research, community-partnered research has been demonstrated to effectively promote long-term adaptive capacity [
