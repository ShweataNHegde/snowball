<p>Although quasi-experimental studies are not necessarily of higher quality than non-experimental studies, in some cases, it may be easier to verify their identifying assumptions for causal inference. For example, in non-experimental studies, all potential confounders (time-varying and time-constant) must be measured and controlled for valid causal inference. Verifying that this assumption is met is extremely difficult and often impossible. For quasi-experiments, the set of identifying assumptions may also be very difficult to verify, but in some cases, can be less onerous than non-experimental studies. For instance, in the set of difference studies, one must only assume the absence of bias from time-varying confounders. In the case of assessing the effect of a heat adaptation plan, for example, one would only need to control for other time varying policies, programs or factors that might affect the association between heat and mortality in the exposed and comparison locations (e.g., cities or neighborhoods). By contrast, in a non-experimental study comparing the health impacts of various heat policies across locations, one would need to control for all factors that varied between the exposed and comparison locations, including differences in demographics and other time-constant characteristics. Other types of quasi-experiments have design-specific identifying assumptions that must be verified. We are encouraged that there have been recent additions to the climate and health literature using a quasi-experimental approach [
