<p>Climate change is described as the biggest global health threat of the 21st century [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-18-07868" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], with some estimates that it could lead to approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year by 2050 [
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-18-07868" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and kill more people globally than all infectious diseases [
 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-18-07868" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The health risks posed by climate change are wide-ranging, including a wider distribution of infectious diseases, increased water and food insecurity, declining air quality, increased magnitude and frequency of extreme heat and other weather events, and population displacement [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-18-07868" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-18-07868" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-18-07868" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The literature describing these risks has grown immensely in the last decade and has drawn upon historical health effects of weather phenomena associated with climate change. However, several critical research gaps remain, particularly in translating knowledge about the health risks of climate change to effective interventions.
