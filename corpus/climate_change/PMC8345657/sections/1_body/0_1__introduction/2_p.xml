<p>The new Biden Administration in the United States (U.S.) has made tackling the climate crisis a top priority. As such, there have been several notable initiatives enacted, namely through the issuance of executive orders related to climate change, the establishment of new federal offices, and a spending request to Congress to allocate funding towards climate change, with an emphasis on environmental justice. These developments bring significant potential to advance climate change and health policies in the U.S., as well as an opportunity to build momentum and demonstrate the return of these federal-level investments on population health outcomes.</p>
