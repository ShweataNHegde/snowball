<p id="Par24">Using a fractional counting method, VOSviewer software has been used to perform cluster analyzes with which to build and visualize the bibliometric network [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. This method states that each action, such as co-authoring or citing a population, has the same weighting regardless of the number of authors, citations or references of a publication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The bibliometric analysis followed the following steps (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). It commenced by defining the search criteria, the keywords and the study period. At first, it was decided to use the terms “climate change induced migrat*” OR “climate migrat*” OR “climate refugee*” OR “environmental migrat*” to analyze the impact of climate change on the migratory movements of people.
