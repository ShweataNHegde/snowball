<p id="Par37">For each RCM, the resulting regression model is then applied to estimate wheat and barley yields using the predictors from the respective CORDEX-Historical and CORDEX-Future RCM simulations. Projections of wheat and barley yields for future climates are computed for RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. Since CORDEX GCM-RCM combinations are numerous, a multi-model ensemble is established by pooling the resulting cereal production yields, i.e., reshaping the 29-year by 18 CORDEX GCM-RCM models’ yield time-series in a one-dimensional sample consisting of 522 forecasted values. ECDFs representative of these pooled yields are further displayed with the objective of identifying potential changes in future wheat and barley production relative to the historical period. To assess if yields derived from CORDEX-Historical and CORDEX-Future are statistically dissimilar, (5% significance level) the nonparametric two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test is used.</p>
