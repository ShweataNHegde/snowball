<p id="Par32">Among the Iberian Peninsula provinces with larger percentages of agricultural land-use and dominated by rainfed cropping systems, we selected two clusters for analysis, comprising 10 provinces in Spain. FigureÂ 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the spatial distribution of the provinces which were aggregated in two regionally distinct clusters, each one consisting of 5 neighbouring provinces. The selection criteria of the study area were built on prior works conducted by the authors

 </sup>, to which we added the province of Badajoz that has a slightly lower percentage of rainfed area, but similar climate conditions (in terms of precipitation and temperature), allowing therefore to consider the same sample size in each cluster, and hence, making easier an accurate regional comparison between the two clusters.
