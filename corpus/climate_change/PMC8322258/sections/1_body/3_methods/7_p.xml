<p id="Par38">To understand the major drivers of yield changing in future climates, anomalies of TX, TN and PR are computed. These are estimated for CORDEX RCMs forced with GCMs for the future relative to the historical climate mean (non-standardized). TX and TN are presented as absolute anomalies (ÂºC), while PR is displayed as percentage anomalies (%). Box plots of anomalies for the most relevant predictors are displayed.</p>
