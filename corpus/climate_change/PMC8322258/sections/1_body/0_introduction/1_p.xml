 </sup>. To overcome this cause/effect problem, policy reforms must be applied at the sector, national and international levels

 </sup>. Examples are the implementation and correct execution of the Paris Agreement (COP21 Paris) by the countries’ governments and the promotion of sustainable agriculture by reforming policies that stimulate unsustainable intensification and overuse of natural resources
