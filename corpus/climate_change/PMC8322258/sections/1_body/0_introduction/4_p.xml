 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>
 </sup>. Additionally, several recent studies tackled the issue of wheat and barley yield fluctuations due to climate change, over different regions of the world
 <sup>

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>
 </sup>, which require a high volume of input data, rigorous calibration, and often several in-situ observations
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>
 </sup>. Moreover, previous works for this region assessed the effects of projected maximum temperature extremes on cereal crops
 <sup>

 </sup>, analysed the adaptation measures for managing wheat in a changing climate
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>
