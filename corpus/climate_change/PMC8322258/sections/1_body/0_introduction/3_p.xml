<p id="Par4">The Mediterranean region, and in particular the Iberian Peninsula, has been identified as prominent climate change hot spot

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>
 </sup>. Nevertheless, climate change impacts and hence their consequences are not evenly distributed in space
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
 </sup>, with their magnitude varying from region to region. With the aim of assessing this local to regional spatial variability, experiments to dynamically or statistically downscale Global Climate Models (GCMs) were designed within projects such as the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX)

 </sup>. As a result, a number of studies were developed resorting to these projects with the aim of analysing impacts of climate change on precipitation and temperature during the twenty-first century in regions encompassed within the Iberian Peninsula. These studies have consistently projected a decrease in the mean precipitation, and an increase in extreme precipitation events
