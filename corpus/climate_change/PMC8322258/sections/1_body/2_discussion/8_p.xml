  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>
 </sup> remain unchanged in the future. Naturally, changes in these factors may be considered adaptation strategies to climate change, which are in continuous development as the impacts and consequences of climate change are more notorious
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>
 </sup>. Results presented here assume a scenario of no-adaptation, and thus represent the worst-case hypothesis, which may be softened by adaptation policies. For example, rainfed winter wheat is a difficult crop to implement adaptation measures, being nevertheless possible to effectively adapt by applying a combination of techniques, such as early sowing dates
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>
 </sup>. This may be a viable strategy to overcome climate change impacts in wheat production for the southern cluster, allowing the crop to develop during a cooler period of the year, which may partially avoid water stressed periods
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>
 </sup> may also be applied to mitigate climate change impacts on wheat yields in that region. Conversely, the northward shift of suitable area should make the northern cluster more apt for wheat production, without changing sowing dates
 <sup>

 </sup>. Moreover, it is relevant to stress that projections of wheat and barley yields to the mid-of-century period entail uncertainties due to multiple interrelated biophysical processes
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>
 </sup>. The use of multi-model ensembles should be seen as a tool to reduce these uncertainties. Indeed, the high degree of coincidence between the different GCM-RCM variables implies a robust result. Nevertheless, uncertainties that may arise from model structure and parametrizations of process-based crop models
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>
 </sup> are not addressed in this work. This is because empirical models do not incorporate a detailed formulation of the physical processes that drive crop and climate relations, aiming only at representing large scale impacts of climate in yields, typically showing similar results to process-based models
