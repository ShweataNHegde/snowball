<p id="Par25">In cluster 1, wheat and barley yields are mainly driven by spring precipitation (April and May) with positive coefficient sign. These predictors are expected to have slightly negative anomalies in the future. This would ultimately result in a decrease of cereal yields. However, results show the opposite, with larger yield increases in the mid-of-century. Indeed, other predictors may contribute with an opposite effect, such as TX in November, which is a used predictor in CCLM5-8-17 and RACMO22E for wheat (accounting for circa 40% of the RCMs used), and HIRHAM5 and RACMO22E for barley (almost 35% of the RCMs). Furthermore, changes in TX11 are substantial with respect to those expected in precipitation predictors, which also helps explain such increases in mid-of-century cereal yields.</p>
