<p id="Par31">This study shows that climate change may have a severe impact on the agricultural landscape as defined today. Indeed, the Iberian Peninsula is notorious for being both a major hot spot for climate change and a major region for rainfed wheat and barley cultivation. However, future changes in cereal production do not show a homogeneous behaviour along the peninsulasâ€™ major farming regions. Indeed, there seems to be a dichotomous demeanour between wheat and barley outputs depending on the latitude they are planted. Severe yield losses are projected for both cereals in the southern region mainly due to the increase in maximum temperatures in spring, particularly when assuming the worst-case scenario of greenhouse gas concentration trajectory. On the other hand, wheat and barley situated further north in the Iberian Peninsula show an increase in yield, which may be linked with the warming of early winter months. This agrees with the observed northward shift of agro-climatic zones and the consequent transition of crop growth suitability

 </sup>. These results show that, as it stands, wheat and barley agriculture may no longer be a viable source of food and income to farmers and to the population in general in southern regions of the Iberian Peninsula, which today largely depends on the social and economic benefits of sowing these cereals. Indeed, this study aims at exposing the influence of climate change (impacts in temperature and precipitation) in the future of these crops, and to alert for the need to implement changes, whether these are local (changing the cultivar species of wheat and barley), country wise (implementing sustainable policies that help mitigate climate change impacts), or even global (mitigate greenhouse gas emissions altogether).
