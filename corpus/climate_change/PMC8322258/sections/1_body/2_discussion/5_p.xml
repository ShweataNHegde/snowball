<p id="Par27">Indeed, climate change may negatively affect wheat and barley crops situated in regions where temperatures and precipitation are already ideal to its development, where a small change may largely disturb growing mechanisms

As expected, changes associated with the RCP4.5 scenario are characterized by the same signal and features as RCP8.5, but with smaller magnitudes.
