<p id="Par23">Correlations between climate variables and wheat and barley yields show a very good agreement among RCMs, particularly in terms of precipitation. Here, the growing season cycles show very distinguishable patterns which are in agreement with results presented in another study

 </sup>, stating that a good production year is influenced by precipitation (more pronounced in cluster 2) and warm temperatures (above average in the more temperate north cluster 1, and below average in the drier cluster 2) in late autumn and early winter, which is paramount to prepare the soil to catch-crop. Moderate amounts of precipitation in early spring, more precipitation and below average temperatures in April and May, and a warm and dry June allow for a slow and complete maturation originating filled and well-formed grains
