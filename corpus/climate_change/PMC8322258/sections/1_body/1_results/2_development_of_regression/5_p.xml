<p id="Par18">Comparison between wheat and barley observed and forecasted yields with CORDEX-Evaluation RCM distributions are displayed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> as ECDFs and box plots. After comparing each RCM-derived yield with the observed yield with a two sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, the null hypothesis that both samples come from the same distribution is verified, at 5% significance level, for all RCM-derived yields and for the multi-model ensemble. Nevertheless, box plots show the inherent variability among models, notably for wheat in cluster 1.
