<p id="Par16">In the case of cluster 2, wheat and barley predictors are not similar, with TX04 (5 out of 7 RCMs) and PR04 (5 out of 7 RCMs) selected to forecast wheat, whilst TX04 (6 out of 7 RCMs) and TN04 (5 out of 7 RCMs) are selected for barley. Furthermore, precipitation in winter seems to have some degree of importance in forecasting wheat (5 out of 7 RCMs selected: November (2), December (2), and January (3)), which is on par with results from Fig.Â
