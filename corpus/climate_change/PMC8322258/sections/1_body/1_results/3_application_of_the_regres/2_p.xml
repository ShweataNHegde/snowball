<p id="Par20">Over cluster 1, both wheat and barley mid-of-century distributions are similar to the historical yields for negative anomalies, albeit fewer extreme losses are projected. In contrast, positive anomalies in the future differ significantly from the ones estimated for the historical climate, with a propensity to larger positive extremes. Indeed, there is a shift to the right of the ECDFs representing the mid-of-century, which becomes larger with greater yield. With increasing warming, the yield distribution for mid-of-century RCP8.5 shows the largest shift to the right. As an example, wheat yield anomalies larger than 2 have a probability of occurrence of near 0% in the historical period; whereas in the RCP8.5 future climate, this probability increases to about 13%. On the positive extreme of the wheat yield ECDFs spectrum, historical period never displays anomalies larger than circa 3.5, whereas in the mid-of-century these anomalies may surpass 6.</p>
