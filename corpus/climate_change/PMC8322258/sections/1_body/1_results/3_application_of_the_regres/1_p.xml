<p id="Par19">Coefficients derived from the Evaluation runs are applied to the GCM forced RCMs for the historical (1972–2000) and mid-of-century (2042–2070) climates (see Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> for end-of-century 2071–2100). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows the yield production ECDFs from the multi-model ensemble. Results are similar between cereals, but show different behaviour depending on the cluster. Moreover, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test rejects the null hypothesis that the future (in both RCPs) and historical samples are from the same continuous distribution at 5% significance level.
