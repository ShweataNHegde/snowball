<p id="Par21">Cluster 2 shows rather different results than those of cluster 1. Here, for both cereals the analysis reveals a shift to the left of the ECDFs representative of the mid-of-century period; i.e., higher probabilities of having yield losses, independently of the anomaly sign. Differences between historical and mid-of-century are more severe than in cluster 1. Indeed, the probability of having barley yield anomaly lower than -2 in the historical climate amounts to about 4% and anomalies smaller than -4 are never identified; in the RCP8.5 (RCP4.5) future climate the probability of having barley yield anomalies lower than -2 reaches more than 30% (18%), and anomaly losses may exceed -7. Notwithstanding, such remarkable shift to the left is not found for positive anomalies, particularly on the extreme end of the ECDFs, where wheat gains remain somewhat similar between historical and mid-of-century climates, and barley anomalies show a decrease from 3 (historical) to 1.8 and 2.2 (RCP8.5 and RCP4.5, respectively).</p>
