<p id="Par12">The case of PR is the most striking, showing a large consistency among RCMs for wheat and barley over the two clusters. Moreover, the dependence of cereal yields on climatic variables reveals a contrasting behaviour between the two clusters. In cluster 1, positive anomalies of precipitation in April and May are the most important contributors to wheat and barley yield, while positive (negative) precipitation anomalies in March embody a negative (positive) effect in these yields. In cluster 2, positive anomalies of precipitation in April and May provide an important contribution to the productivity of the two cereals, albeit with a decrease in relevance of May precipitation when compared to cluster 1. Furthermore, winter precipitation proves to be an important factor to harvested yield, with November (wheat and barley) and December (wheat) showing large positive correlations.</p>
