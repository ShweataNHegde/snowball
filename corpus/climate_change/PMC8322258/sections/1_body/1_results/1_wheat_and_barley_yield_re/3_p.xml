<p id="Par13">On the other hand, TX and TN correlations with observed wheat and barley yields show larger variations dependent on the selected RCM. These are most prominent over cluster 1 (northern), where TX and TN show contrasting correlations in April and May, depending on the chosen RCM. The most notable differences are between IPSL-WRF381P TX and TN (correlations of about -0.1 and 0.4) and CNMR-ALADIN63 TX and TN (correlations of about -0.6 and -0.3) with both cereal yields. Due to inter-RCM differences, it is not as simple to define the most important yield-driving factors as with PR. In general, in cluster 1, warm (cold) winters and mild (warm) springs are the most favourable (unfavourable) to wheat and barley growth. While for the case of TN, the most consistently important month among RCMs is March, where mild (warm) minimum temperatures have a positive (negative) contribution to cereal yield. In cluster 2, TX in April and May, and TN in May show a large relation with both wheat and barley yields (with correlations up to -0.8). Thus, for each cluster and cereal a stepwise regression method is applied to select the most relevant predictors for the various CORDEX-Evaluation RCMs.</p>
