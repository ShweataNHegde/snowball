<p id="Par11">Two clusters in the Iberian Peninsula mainly composed by rainfed wheat and barley are selected to perform this study (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Correlations between observed wheat and barley yields and maximum air temperature (TX), minimum air temperature (TN), and accumulated precipitation (PR) simulated by the seven CORDEX-Evaluation RCMs show an overall good agreement (Fig.
