<p>The regional LCDI summaries (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) capture interactions of population density and economic production as well as human modification of the natural landscape. Regions summarized by a positive LCDI are the dominant pattern, with a global LCDI median of +1.11 (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Most frequently, positive LCDI regions are northern latitude regions represented by the Arctic Ocean, eastern Europe, Central Asia. In these regions, model simulations indicate that the warming effects of anthropogenic GH emissions are amplified. Although sparsely populated, these high-latitude regions are critical as they support indigenous communities and are ecologically unique, and their ocean and cryosphere play a pivotal role in global climate regulation (

 </xref>). The regions summarized by negative LCDI are largely located within the densely populated temperate regions such as western Europe, eastern North America, and East Asia. These regions have historically high emissions and relatively small future temperature shifts. Perhaps unexpectedly, several nation states with the most positive LCDI scores are large, sparsely populated countries, where extreme temperature shifts are projected during the 21st century (Russia, Canada, and Finland). Nation states with the lowest LCDI values are smaller, industrialized countries in Europe and the Middle East (Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, and Kuwait). As
