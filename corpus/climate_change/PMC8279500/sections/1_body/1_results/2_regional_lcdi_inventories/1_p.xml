<p>For interpretive value, we summarized the distribution of LCDI values within larger political, geographic, and ecological boundaries. As any such regional assessment is sensitive to the geometry of the underlying spatial units, we expressed the ensembleâ€™s 10th, 50th, and 90th quantiles, also to convey the frequently substantial LCDI variability within boundaries (fig. S12). We ranked units by the 10th quantile to focus on the contributions from negative LCDI values in each unit. This ranking emphasizes areas of extreme emissions and their disproportionate influence on climate change, with large and heterogenous spatial units such as the United States and China in mind. This ranking, however, does not affect smaller or more homogenous spatial units, such as Belgium or the east Indo-Pacific Ocean, respectively.</p>
