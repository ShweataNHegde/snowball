<p>Steep LCDI gradients are found within continents of Europe and Asia (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref> and fig. S15). Considered in geographical order, western Europe has the most positive LCDI and eastern Europe the second lowest, where East and South Asia have the second and third highest LCDI score, respectively, and Central Asia has the lowest. Consistent with previous results at larger geographic scales, smaller and densely populated U.S. states (New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania) exhibit negative LCDI values, while sparsely populated northern states such as Alaska and South Dakota have positive LCDI values (
