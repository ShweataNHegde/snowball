<p>Among the biogeographic groupings, northern high-latitude biomes are generally characterized with positive LCDI scores (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref> and fig. S14). Temperate deciduous forests and mangroves, however, have the most negative LCDI among ecological biomes. This result is likely due to the high rates of land conversion in mangroves and temperate forests and their subsequent economic development (

 </xref>,

 </xref>) combined with relatively modest projected temperature shifts. Densely populated urban environments and intensive agricultural regions (irrigated crops and rice) exhibit the most negative LCDIs among the anthropogenic biomes (
