<p>Why has it been so challenging to develop a global response to anthropogenic climate change? The answer, in part, relates to climate change manifesting a classic problem of collective action (

 </xref>). One obstacle to collective action may be rooted in the public understanding of the complex (

 </xref>) and nonlinear nature of the emissions and climate change relationship. Anthropogenic GH emissions, for example, are concentrated in densely populated regions (see 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), mostly in the northern hemisphere from 30° to 55°N (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and figs. S1 and S2). These emissions, however, disperse throughout the planet’s atmosphere and manifest their warming effects worldwide, although warming is especially amplified above 60°N in the polar arctic (

 </xref>). A result of this pattern of geographic asymmetry is that less than 8% of the earth’s surface area has generated 90% of historical GH emissions (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and fig. S4). While emissions are concentrated, however, more than 51% of the earth’s surface is projected to warm by at least 3°C before the end of the 21st century (
