<p>When combined, geographical asymmetries between emissions and their projected warming reveal steep inequalities. Regions within western Europe and East Asia, for example, emitted 1.6 kg m

 <sup>−1</sup> of combined GH emissions over 1970–2018 for every 1°C of projected warming from 2050 to 2099 (RCP 8.5; results mapped in fig. S5). At the same time, much of the polar arctic has zero GH emissions yet is projected to warm by more than 8°C (

Therefore, the impacts of climate change are not constrained to regions of high anthropogenic GH emissions, and the emission-warming relationship is essentially decoupled and statistically independent at the local scale. This spatial nonstationarity likely masks the far-reaching and transboundary consequences of local GH emissions from the public and contributes to the lasting consensus gap on climate change (
