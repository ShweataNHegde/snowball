<p>To illustrate and inform on these issues, here, we derive a local index of climate disparity using empirical datasets of anthropogenic emissions and simulations of future climate change impacts. The recent availability of reanalysis products from archived observations of the primary GH emission agents—carbon dioxide (CO
 <sub>2</sub>), black carbon (BC), methane (CH
 <sub>4</sub>), and nitrous oxide (N
 <sub>2</sub>O) (

 </xref>)—provides a fresh opportunity to examine the geography of the emission–climate change relationship. We aggregate these emission data and compare them to future climate simulations from the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) to generate an index of local climate disparity with global coverage. Through our analysis, we aim to help clarify the inherent complexity of anthropogenic climate change across ecological and geopolitical boundaries. This study is a contribution to the ongoing climate change dialogue addressing the global equity and collective action problem. We hope that this informs public understanding, which, in turn, may urge collective action on effective climate mitigation and adaptation measures.
