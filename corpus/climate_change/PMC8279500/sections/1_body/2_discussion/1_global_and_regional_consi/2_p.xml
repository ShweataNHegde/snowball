<p>Our global emission dataset combines several individual emission inventories, each of which is subject to sampling errors or a lack of reporting (

  <italic>22</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>23</italic>
 </xref>). While these emission inventories are influenced by the political or socioeconomic stability of the region, the magnitude of impact of any errors on the ensuing emission products will correspond to the underlying magnitude of economic development of the region. Beyond governance, transparency, and data availability, BC emissions have additional uncertainties because of rapidly shifting technology, consumption rates, and fuel types (
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>24</italic>
 </xref>). As BC is an aerosol (an aerial suspension of solid particulate matter), emissions are more easily measured with remote sensing. In addition, our global emission inventory is a first-order description based on local consumption and does not account for emissions embodied in economic trade (

 </xref>). Future analyses may be improved upon by expanding upon the GH emission inventory we compiled here (table S1), accounting for the geographically distant emissions required to support localized consumption, or couching the results in terms of human population density (see figs. S18 to S20) (
