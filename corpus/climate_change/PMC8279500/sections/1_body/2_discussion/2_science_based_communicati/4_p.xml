<p>Communicating climate change impacts on coupled human-natural systems requires a clear understanding of the complex emissionâ€“climate change relationship. To our knowledge, our LCDI presents the first global, regional, and national inventory of spatially resolved human-climate disparity over both terrestrial and marine domains. Efforts to apply empirical approaches to disentangle and explicitly quantify the spatial pattern of geographical disparity of human systems to projected climate change should remain an active research field that is engaged with public communication, policy, and decision makers. Our LCDI is dependent on publicly available information and open-source code and can be easily revised to consider additional data inventories and reproduced for applications at different spatial scales. This may serve as a baseline model to highlight the geographically distant climate impacts from local emissions as well as highlight social, political, and economic inequalities across the planet. We hope that these simple illustrations of the complex relationship between the causes and consequences of climate change may advance solutions that have, to date, eluded global efforts to facilitate collective action.</p>
