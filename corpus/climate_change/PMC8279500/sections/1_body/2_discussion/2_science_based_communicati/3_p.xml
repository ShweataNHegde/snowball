<p>Our LCDI methods are scalable to accommodate additional pollutants and measures of impact as these data become available. Studies have shown that some anthropogenic emissions (e.g., SO
 <sub>2</sub>) are radiatively active yet have minimal or even cooling effects on surface temperature (

Many climate change metrics are available beyond projections of surface warming, but some of these may make more physical or policy sense than others and therefore confer specific interpretive value. Our analysis is based on the ensemble mean differences in surface temperatures, a standard IPCC metric that can be easily translated to general audiences and applied to the temperature target-based climate negotiation framework (

Our combined GH emission layer and LCDI can help to ensure that these dialogues are both policy-oriented and science-based and aligned with the “common but differentiated responsibility” principle established at the foundational 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (
