<p>To these points, recent dialogue on climate change collective action has specifically called for communication tools that bring together a more diverse global community and increase the understanding of broad-scale risks (

The LCDI metric we provide here quantifies the magnitude of local disconnect between GH emissions and temperature shifts, offering a science-based communication tool for transboundary understanding and collective action. This tool may be effective at different geographic scales. At a national level, surveys of adults in the United States (

 </xref>) indicate that consensus belief in global warming is lower in states where our LCDI is high, and vice versa (

At the regional scale, our LCDI may help illustrate the need for consumption-based emission inventories that account for GH emissions embodied in economic production and thereby include the trade-related emissions that local consumption requires and enables (
