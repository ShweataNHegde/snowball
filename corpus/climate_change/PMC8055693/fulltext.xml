Already subtle variations in the timing of stratification onset and break-up (phenology) are known to have major ecological effects, mainly by determining the availability of light, nutrients, carbon and oxygen to organisms. Despite its ecological importance, historic and future global changes in stratification phenology are unknown. Here, we used a lake-climate model ensemble and long-term observational data, to investigate changes in lake stratification phenology across the Northern Hemisphere from 1901 to 2099. Under the high-greenhouse-gas-emission scenario, stratification will begin 22.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7.0 days earlier and end 11.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.7 days later by the end of this century. It is very likely that this 33.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;11.7 day prolongation in stratification will accelerate lake deoxygenation with subsequent effects on nutrient mineralization and phosphorus release from lake sediments. Further misalignment of lifecycle events, with possible irreversible changes for lake ecosystems, is also likely.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Stratification has a considerable influence on lake ecology, but there is little understanding of past or future changes in its seasonality.

Lakes in these northern regions experience strong seasonality in climatic forcing, and, as a result, exhibit a pronounced seasonal variation in temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Temperature has a fundamental effect on nearly all biological activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In lakes, temperature variations are complex, particularly where the phenomenon of thermal stratification adds an additional impact on biological productivity by directly influencing the size of the trophogenic zone in which photosynthesis takes place and also influencing nutrient supply from deep water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Seasonal stratification in lakes results from the interaction of turbulent mixing, forced mainly by surface wind-stress in conjunction with heat exchange at the air&#x02013;water interface. During the spring&#x02013;summer period, the stratifying effect of surface heat input competes with vertical mixing to determine the evolution of water column stability. In all but very shallow lakes (or some very deep lakes where stratification can be almost permanent), a stratified regime develops as heating outcompetes the effects of mixing&#x02014;commonly referred to as the onset of stratification. This stratified regime continues until the autumn period, when lakes begin to lose heat to the atmosphere and both wind-stress and heat loss act to erode stratification and induce the autumnal overturn&#x02014;also referred to as the break-up of stratification. The timing of stratification onset and break-up, collectively referred to as stratification phenology, plays a fundamental role in numerous physical, chemical, and biological lake processes, including population dynamics and interactions of aquatic species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Due to its ecological importance, changes in stratification phenology have been studied in individual lakes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> or a very few lakes within specific regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. However, on a global scale, the influence of climate change on stratification phenology remains largely unexplored. This knowledge gap is of considerable concern given the high vulnerability of lake ecosystems, and the threatened biodiversity that they currently support, to climate change. To fill the fundamental knowledge gap, here we quantify past changes and assess future ones in lake stratification phenology across the Northern Hemisphere. We combined an analysis of long-term observational data from some of the best monitored lakes in the world, with daily simulations from an ensemble of lake models, each forced with climate data from an ensemble of twentieth and twenty-first century climate projections, under different anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)): RCP 2.6 (low-emission scenario), 6.0 (medium&#x02013;high-emission scenario), and 8.5 (high-emission scenario). Using all lake&#x02013;climate model ensembles (see &#x0201c;Methods&#x0201d;), we simulated stratification phenology for Northern Hemisphere lakes from 1901 to 2099.</p><p id="Par6">In this work, we show that climate change during the twenty-first century will have a considerable influence on stratification phenology, with lakes across the Northern Hemisphere stratifying sooner and maintaining their stratification for longer. In turn, our results show that the duration of the thermally stratified period will increase within a warming world, with lakes situated at higher latitudes projected to experience the greatest relative change.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Stratification phenology in Northern Hemisphere lakes</title><p id="Par7">Our long-term daily simulations suggest that thermal stratification in Northern Hemisphere lakes during the historic period (averaged here for all years from 1970 to 1999) typically begins between March and July and ends between June and December (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Using a random forest model (see &#x0201c;Methods&#x0201d;), we investigated the climatic and lake morphological drivers of the simulated mean stratification onset and break-up dates. Predictor variables included seasonal (Northern Hemisphere cold and warm season) air temperature and wind speed, lake depth, and surface area (see &#x0201c;Methods&#x0201d;). Using these predictor variables, we were able to explain as much as 93% of the across lake variation in both the timing of historic stratification onset and break-up (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>). For the timing of stratification onset, we found that the cold-season (November to April) air temperature was the most important driver, followed by the cold-season wind speed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). The role of both air temperature and wind speed on the timing of stratification onset can be explained primarily due to their individual or, indeed, combined influence on lake surface temperature and, in turn, the vertical water density gradient in spring/summer. For example, as heat input acts to increase water column stability by warming the near-surface layer to above the temperature of maximum density (~3.98&#x02009;&#x000b0;C), higher wind speed can both enhance heat loss via turbulent mixing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and/or mix near-surface waters to greater depths, thus eroding any established vertical density gradient. Therefore, if air temperature is high and wind speed is low, one can expect an earlier onset of stratification. Conversely, if air temperature is low and wind speed is high, one can expect later stratification onset. In agreement with our expectations, a regression tree (which explained 85% of the variation in stratification onset) showed that lakes situated within a warmer climate stratified sooner than those elsewhere (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.88; Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>), and the latest stratification onset dates occurred in lakes located in the coldest and windiest regions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). This result was confirmed by satellite-derived estimates of stratification onset for 60 Northern Hemisphere lakes (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>; see &#x0201c;Methods&#x0201d;).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Simulations of lake stratification phenology across the Northern Hemisphere.</title><p>Shown are the historic, averaged over all years from 1970 to 1999, spatial patterns in <bold>a</bold> the day of year of stratification onset, <bold>b</bold> the cold-season (November&#x02013;April) average air temperature, and <bold>c</bold> the relationship between stratification onset, the cold&#x02013;season air temperature, and wind speed.

Specifically, in many large Northern Hemisphere lakes, winter lake surface temperatures are typically below the temperature of maximum density (e.g. during ice cover), resulting in an inversely stratified water column and the formation of a colder, less dense upper mixed layer above denser, warmer bottom waters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Springtime heating leads to the loss of lake ice and warms near-surface waters, increasing water density and resulting in convective mixing through a deep volume of water with large thermal inertia. As a result, springtime heating can bring a more rapid rise in lake surface temperature in shallow lakes with smaller thermal inertia. Also, due to the higher surface momentum transfer from near-surface wind in large lakes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, winds can have a stronger influence on the date of stratification onset. However, across our studied lakes, the across-lake variations in air temperature and wind speed were the dominant drivers (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, c</xref>).</p><p id="Par9">In contrast to stratification onset, wind speed (averaged over the warm season, May to October) was the most important driver of the mean stratification break-up date, followed by lake depth and warm season air temperatures (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Lakes situated in regions with higher mean wind speeds experienced an earlier break-up of stratification (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.81; Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1b</xref>). This result could, again, be verified by satellite-derived estimates of stratification break-up (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Higher wind speeds can result in earlier stratification break-up by (i) enhancing turbulent heat loss at the air&#x02013;water interface and (ii) mixing warm near-surface waters to greater depths and thus reducing the vertical density gradient. A regression tree analysis explained 80% of the variation in the timing of stratification break-up and revealed complex interactions between the warm season wind speed, air temperature, and lake depth in explaining stratification break-up across lakes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Stratification break-up was earliest in lakes shallower than 15&#x02009;m located in warm and windy regions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>) and was latest in deep lakes located in cool, still regions. The depth effect of stratification break-up is primarily due to the presence of a deeper (and thus of higher volume) upper mixed layer in summer, resulting in lake temperatures being less sensitive to day-to-day changes in atmospheric forcing and thus experiencing a delayed break-up of stratification compared to shallower lakes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.

To explain the remaining variability, factors such as water transparency, which can differ across lakes due to changes in land management practices and precipitation patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, could potentially also be considered. Stronger light attenuation (i.e. due to darker surface waters) can increase lake surface water temperature in spring and summer, resulting in earlier stratification onset, but result in faster cooling in autumn<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, thus leading to earlier stratification break-up.

Changes in salinity, notably the within-lake vertical salinity gradient, could have an influence on stratification phenology by influencing the vertical density difference.

For example, an earlier onset of stratification, as our historic and future simulations suggest under climate change, has been found to facilitate phytoplankton growth in lakes through the amelioration of light limitation. In a number of lakes, this has brought forward the onset of the spring bloom<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.

Earlier growth may also open up ecological niches later in the spring that enable the growth of potentially harmful filamentous species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> that may represent a poorer food resource for grazers. The extent to which trophic mismatching is likely to occur between peaks in phytoplankton and zooplankton grazers is unclear, since changes in peak timing in resource and consumer differ between studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, although rates of change at higher trophic levels may be slower<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, with potential for impacts on fish recruitment and survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. The extent to which changes in stratification phenology will influence lake ecosystems will depend on a suite of variables, including trophic interactions and community dynamics, but could potentially lead to abrupt shifts in global lake ecosystems during the current century<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par17">The change in stratification phenology that our ensemble projections suggest are also very likely to have a considerable influence on the interactions between surface and bottom waters, such as the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and carbon. A longer decoupling between epilimnetic and hypolimnetic ecosystem processes will influence some of the key rules of life in lake ecosystems to which temperature, light, nutrient regimes, and habitat succession belong<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. The severity of such impact is also, however, dependent on limiting conditions in a particular lake. For example, an increasing duration of thermal stratification, closely coupled to oxygen concentrations in bottom waters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, facilitates the process of oxygen depletion, by preventing vertical mixing of oxygen from the surface. We suggest that most pronounced ecosystem changes will occur in lakes that will experience hypoxic conditions for the first time and in lakes where the duration of hypoxia will be extended as a response to the projected prolongation in stratification. Generally, it is expected that the projected prolongation in stratification will result in the deoxygenation of productive lakes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, where, in the worst case, the occurrence of fish die-off events will increase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Anoxic conditions at the sediment&#x02013;water interface have the potential to result in substantial nutrient leakage from sediments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> and to have subsequent effects on nutrient mineralization. In particular, declines in redox potential in productive lakes can reduce iron and allow for a substantial phosphorus release from the sediments to the overlying water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Anoxia is also known to favour the production of the potent greenhouse gas methane, which is produced in and emitted from lakes at globally significant rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Thus, the changes in stratification phenology that we have described here, and the resulting decrease in bottom water oxygen concentrations that could occur in many lakes, could contribute to a further acceleration of climate change and thus represents a positive feedback that should be carefully considered in future climate change impact studies. However, it is also important to consider that an earlier onset of stratification can also imply a shorter ice-cover season within a warming climate (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>), and thus less winter hypoxia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.

The longest continuous moored record has been collected by the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, which has had a site occupied in southern Lake Michigan since 1991. Another site in western Lake Superior has been occupied since 2005 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>). Neither of these have sufficient data to explore climate-related changes in stratification phenology. However, there are several sites at which surface water temperature has been measured by meteorology buoys in recent decades. Surface water temperature from these buoys can be a useful proxy for stratification phenology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Specifically, when the surface water temperature reaches the temperature of maximum density (3.98&#x02009;&#x000b0;C at the surface of fresh water lakes), stability considerations require that deep water temperatures must be between the temperature of maximum density for a given depth (this temperature decreases by 0.2&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for every 100&#x02009;m depth) and the surface temperature of maximum density. Therefore, the heat content of the water column is known to a high level of confidence, so that the date of this occurrence is a useful phenological indicator. Reaching 3.98&#x02009;&#x000b0;C at the surface in the spring thus coincides with the onset of positive stratification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>.

Ontario is excluded from the study since data are only available as far back as 2002; Erie is excluded because its surface temperature is typically already above the temperature of maximum density when the buoys are deployed in the spring. At all sites, the buoys are typically recovered before the lake cools through the temperature of maximum density, so there is not sufficient data to examine the break-up of stratification.

Here, the across-lake variability in stratification phenology, as calculated from the model ensembles during the historic period, were compared with those estimated from satellite-derived lake temperatures. Notably, stratification phenology was estimated using lake surface temperatures from the European Space Agency&#x02019;s Climate Change Initiative (CCI) Lakes project (CCI Lakes; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cci.esa.int/lakes">http://cci.esa.int/lakes</ext-link>), which contains daily observations from 250 lakes worldwide. From these lakes, we selected those situated in the Northern Hemisphere (&#x0003e;30&#x000b0;N) and those large enough for the existence of a 10&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10 pixel array of pure water surrounding the lake centre, defined as the maximum distance to land, following the recommendations of ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup> for minimizing land contamination of the satellite retrievals.</p><p id="Par34">Not all lakes within the CCI Lakes data set were suitable for this study. Here, we were only interested in freshwater lakes (due to the temperature&#x02013;density relationship described previously that complicates the identification of stratification from surface observations), and thus we removed all brackish/saline lakes from the analysis. To identify which lakes were freshwater and which were brackish/saline, we first extracted the names of each lake within CCI Lakes, achieved by mapping the CCI lake mask onto the Hydrolakes data set<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>. Lake names were then used within a literature search to identify whether a given lake was freshwater/saline/brackish. For lakes with no available information, we then used the Hydrolakes database to identify which lakes were likely situated in terminal sinks (i.e. with no throughflow) and were thus likely to be brackish/saline. To identify these lakes, we used the average discharge information available in Hydrolakes, and all lakes with negligible discharge (&#x0003c;1&#x02009;m<sup>3</sup>&#x02009;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) were removed from the analysis.</p><p id="Par35">Another criterion for estimating stratification phenology from surface temperature observations is that the studied lakes must experience seasonal stratification, notably that they are characterized as monomictic or dimictic. For example, the 3.98&#x02009;&#x000b0;C temperature threshold would not be an indicator of stratification phenology in polymictic lakes (i.e. those that mix frequently). To identify the mixing regime of each lake, we again used information available in the published literature. For lakes with no information available, we used modelled lake surface and bottom water temperatures to simulate the lake mixing regime following the methods of ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Lake surface and bottom water temperature simulations for each lake were extracted from ECMWF&#x02019;s ERA5 product<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup> for the corresponding grid (0.25&#x000b0; resolution) of each lake centre pixel. ERA5 lake surface temperatures have been shown previously to accurately simulate the thermal environment of lakes at a global scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par36">For all lakes that were considered suitable to estimate stratification phenology from surface temperature observations, notably those that passed the criteria described above, we calculated the lake mean surface temperature time series from the satellite data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, which were then used to identify the first and last day of year in which surface temperature cross the 3.98&#x02009;&#x000b0;C threshold. Only observations from 2007 to 2019, the time period in which most satellite retrievals were available in ESA CCI Lakes v1.0, were used in this study, as the low temporal resolution of retrievals prior to 2007 could bias the calculated stratification phenology. Furthermore, the satellite data were only used to identify the onset and break-up of thermal stratification if the temporal resolution of observations were considered adequate for each year. Specifically, we only used the satellite observations to estimate stratification onset if measurements were available at a temporal frequency of &#x0003c;5 days for at least 75% of the ice-free period, defined using the lake ice cover data from ESA CCI Lakes. Linear interpolation was then used to generate a gap-free time series when each of the previous criteria were met. The onset and break-up of thermal stratification averaged across all years per lake were then compared to the cold- and warm-season climatic data (air temperature and wind speed), respectively. For this comparison, we used climate data from ERA5, extracted from the same lake centre pixels as the lake temperatures described above. ERA5 data were used, as opposed to the ISIMIP2b historic climate projections, because the latter finish in 2005, and the satellite data used do not start until 2007. This also forms an additional validation of the relationships shown between climate and lake stratification, as both independent data sets produced similar results. One additional limitation for this criterion for defining stratification break-up is in shallower dimictic or monomictic lakes, which often mix at significantly higher temperatures than 3.98&#x02009;&#x000b0;C due to the build-up of heat within the hypolimnion during summer.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec18"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="41467_2021_22657_MOESM1_ESM.pdf"><caption><p>Supplementary Information</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Peer review information</bold>
