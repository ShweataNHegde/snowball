The lake model projections are the result of a collective effort from different authors with leadership on different lake models as follows: ALBM (Z.T.), LAKE (A.D., V.S.), SimStrat-UoG (M.P.), GOTM (M.G., D.M.-G.). L.G. analysed the lake ice projections. R.L., J.M., T.N.M., T.S., I.V., J.A.A., C.L.D., M.D., S.L.F., E.B.M., S.G.S., and S.W. contributed to data analysis.

All authors participated in discussions, revisions, and the final production of this manuscript. M.G., R.M., D.P., and W.T. led the ISIMIP Lake Sector.</p>
