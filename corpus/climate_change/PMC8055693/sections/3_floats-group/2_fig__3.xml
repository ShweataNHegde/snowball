  <title>Observations of stratification phenology under historic to contemporary climate change.</title>
  <p>Shown are the temporal changes in stratification 
   <bold>a</bold> onset and 
   <bold>b</bold> break-up in Blelham Tarn, UK. Also shown, in 
   <bold>c</bold>, are the calculated trends in stratification onset and break-up across all lakes with observational data investigated in this study (Supplementary Table 
   <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Note that stratification break-up data are not available for all lakes (see “Methods”), thus are not shown in 
   <bold>c</bold>. Error bars in 
   <bold>c</bold> represent the standard error of the calculated trend.
