  <title>Simulations of lake stratification phenology across the Northern Hemisphere.</title>
  <p>Shown are the historic, averaged over all years from 1970 to 1999, spatial patterns in 
   <bold>a</bold> the day of year of stratification onset, 
   <bold>b</bold> the cold-season (November–April) average air temperature, and 
   <bold>c</bold> the relationship between stratification onset, the cold–season air temperature, and wind speed. Also shown are the spatial patterns in 
   <bold>d</bold> the day of year of stratification break-up, 
   <bold>e</bold> the warm-season (May–October) average air temperature, and 
   <bold>f</bold> the relationship between stratification break-up, the warm-season air temperature, and wind speed. All results are based on the average simulations across the lake–climate model ensemble.
