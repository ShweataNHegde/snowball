  <title>Absolute and percentage change in the duration of stratification during the twenty-first century.</title>
  <p>Shown are the spatial patterns in the percentage change in the duration of stratification by the end of the twenty-first century (2070–2099), relative to 1970–1999, under 
   <bold>a</bold> RCP 2.6, 
   <bold>b</bold> RCP 6.0, and 
   <bold>c</bold> RCP 8.5. Also shown, across the four dominant Northern Hemisphere lake thermal regions, are 
   <bold>d</bold> changes in stratification duration and 
   <bold>e</bold> the percentage difference by the end of the century under RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5. The thermal regions defined include Northern Frigid (NF), Northern Cool (NC), Northern Temperate (NT), and Northern Warm (NW). The distribution of these thermal regions across the Northern Hemisphere are shown in Supplementary Fig.
