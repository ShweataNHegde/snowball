<p id="Par15">The severity of change in stratification phenology by the end of the twenty-first century is explained primarily by the magnitude of change in the climatic drivers investigated. As expected, regions which are projected to experience the greatest change in cold- or warm-season air temperature and wind speed are also expected to experience the greatest change in stratification phenology. We also find a strong relationship between the anomalies in the day of year of ice break-up and the change in the day of year in which lakes stratify during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries (Supplementary Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>), with later ice cover break-up intuitively leading to a later onset of thermal stratification. Furthermore, regions that are projected to experience an increase in near-surface wind speed by the end of the twenty-first century should expect lower changes in stratification phenology compared to lakes in other regions, with increasing wind speeds counteracting some of the global warming-induced changes in stratification phenology. On the contrary, a decline in near-surface wind speed by the end of the century will likely exacerbate the influence of climatic warming on lake stratification in Northern Hemisphere lakes
