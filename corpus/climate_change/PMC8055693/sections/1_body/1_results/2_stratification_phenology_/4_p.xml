<p id="Par14">Given the projected change in both stratification onset and break-up by the end of this century, the duration of the stratified period will increase (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e, f</xref>). Under RCP 2.6, 6.0, and 8.5, the duration of stratification will increase by 13.0 ± 6.0, 21.9 ± 8.5, and 33.2 ± 11.6 days, respectively, on average. The magnitude of change in the duration of stratification differs slightly across the lake thermal regions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). For example, under RCP 8.5, the average change in stratification duration by 2070–2099 across the thermal regions are Northern Frigid: Northern Cool: Northern Temperate: Northern Warm = 29.9 ± 8.4:34.8 ± 5.7:35.7± 11.6:31.9 ± 13.9 days. However, while the magnitude of change will be comparable, the percentage change in stratification duration will be considerably greater in the northernmost thermal region i.e. Northern Frigid (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Under RCP 8.5, the percentage increase in the duration of stratification across the thermal regions are Northern Frigid: Northern Cool: Northern Temperate: Northern Warm = 61.4 ± 15.9%:39.0 ± 15.2%:29.3 ± 11.6%:20.5 ± 12.5% (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Thus, a similar average increase of ~30 days in stratification duration projected in the Northern Frigid and Northern Warm thermal regions correspond to an almost threefold difference in the relative change in stratification duration. This is due to a shorter mean duration of thermal stratification during the historic period at higher latitudes, compared to lakes situated in the warmer southern regions.
