<p id="Par13">In line with the projected changes in climatic forcing, our lake model simulations suggest that lake stratification phenology will change substantially in the near future (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Under RCP 2.6, the onset of stratification will occur 8.8 ± 3.5 days earlier and the break-up of stratification will occur 4.2 ± 2.6 days later by the end of the twenty-first century (averaged over all years and lakes from 2070 to 2099). Under RCP 6.0, stratification onset and break-up will occur 14.7 ± 5.1 days earlier and 7.3 ± 3.8 days later, respectively. The largest change in stratification phenology are projected under RCP 8.5 with stratification onset and break-up, respectively, occurring 22.0 ± 7.0 days earlier and 11.3 ± 4.7 days later, on average across the Northern Hemisphere. To investigate further these long-term projected changes in stratification phenology and to explore their regional variability, we separate the studied lakes according to the thermal regions in which they reside (see “Methods”). Approximately 98% of our studied lakes are situated within the four northernmost thermal regions (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7a, b</xref>): Northern Frigid (31%), Northern Cool (43%), Northern Temperate (16%), and Northern Warm (8%). Within these four regions, our simulations suggest that the change in stratification onset by 2070–2099 will be relatively similar (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7c–e</xref>). For example, under RCP 8.5, the average projected change in stratification onset across the four thermal regions are Northern Frigid: Northern Cool: Northern Temperate: Northern Warm = −21.6 ± 4.9:−22.5 ± 3.7:−22.8 ± 5.7:−21.8 ± 7.3 days. The average change in stratification break-up are 10.2 ± 4.8:12.5 ± 4.0:13.4 ± 5.5:11.6 ± 8.2 days, respectively.
