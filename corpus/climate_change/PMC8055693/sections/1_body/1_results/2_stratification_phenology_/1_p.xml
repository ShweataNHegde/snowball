<p id="Par11">Our model projections during the historic period, from 1901 to 2005, show noticeable temporal changes in lake stratification phenology, particularly since the 1980s (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Monitoring data from lakes across the Northern Hemisphere (see “Methods”) confirm such changes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). For example, Lake Tahoe (California, Nevada) has experienced a considerable change in stratification phenology since the 1960s, with lake stratification onset occurring 2.1 days earlier and stratification break-up occurring 4.4 days later per decade. Similar long-term changes are observed in the United Kingdom with, for example, Blelham Tarn (English Lake District; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) now stratifying 24 days earlier and maintaining its stratification for an additional 18 days, compared to the start of the observational record (here we compare averages between the first [1963–1972] and last [2008–2017] 10 years of observational data available). The upper North American Great Lakes (Superior, Huron, Michigan), which represent some of the world’s largest freshwater ecosystems and contain irreplaceable biodiversity, are also experiencing rapid changes in stratification phenology. For example, from 1980 to 2019 stratification onset has changed at an average rate of 3.5 ± 2.2 days per decade (quoted uncertainties represent the standard deviation across the Great Lakes) and can even vary by up to 48 days between some extreme years (Supplementary Fig.
