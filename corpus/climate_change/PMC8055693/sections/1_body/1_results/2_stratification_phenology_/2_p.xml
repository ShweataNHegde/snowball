<p id="Par12">During the twenty-first century (2006 to 2099), air temperature is projected to increase considerably across the Northern Hemisphere land surface (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Specifically, climate model projections suggest that by 2070–2099 the cold-season air temperature will increase, relative to 1970–1999 (hereafter all future changes are quoted relative to this base-period average), by an average of 2.8 ± 0.9 °C, 5.0 ± 1.4 °C, and 7.5 ± 1.9 °C between RCP 2.6, 6.0, and 8.5, respectively (quoted uncertainties represent the standard deviation from the model ensemble). Similar changes are also projected during the warm season, with air temperatures increasing by 2.1 ± 0.8 °C, 3.8 ± 1.1 °C, and 5.8 ± 1.6 °C between RCP 2.6, 6.0, and 8.5, respectively. In comparison to these projected changes in air temperature, the projected change in near-surface wind speed is relatively minor. Notably, across the Northern Hemisphere land surface, cold-season wind speed is projected to change by −0.03 ± 0.05 ms

 <sup>−1</sup>, and −0.03 ± 0.09 ms
 <sup>−1</sup> between RCP 2.6, 6.0, and 8.5, respectively. During the warm season, near-surface wind speed will change by −0.1 ± 0.06 ms
 <sup>−1</sup>, −0.1 ± 0.08 ms
 <sup>−1</sup>, and −0.14 ± 0.1 ms

 </sup>. Therefore, while the projected changes in wind speed, when averaged across the Northern Hemisphere land surface, are relatively small and cannot, with confidence, be described as either decreasing or increasing under all RCPs, local-scale projected changes in wind speed (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>) could have a considerable influence on stratification phenology this century.
