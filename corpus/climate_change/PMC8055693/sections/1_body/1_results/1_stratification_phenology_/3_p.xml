<p id="Par9">In contrast to stratification onset, wind speed (averaged over the warm season, May to October) was the most important driver of the mean stratification break-up date, followed by lake depth and warm season air temperatures (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Lakes situated in regions with higher mean wind speeds experienced an earlier break-up of stratification (

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1b</xref>). This result could, again, be verified by satellite-derived estimates of stratification break-up (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Higher wind speeds can result in earlier stratification break-up by (i) enhancing turbulent heat loss at the air–water interface and (ii) mixing warm near-surface waters to greater depths and thus reducing the vertical density gradient. A regression tree analysis explained 80% of the variation in the timing of stratification break-up and revealed complex interactions between the warm season wind speed, air temperature, and lake depth in explaining stratification break-up across lakes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Stratification break-up was earliest in lakes shallower than 15 m located in warm and windy regions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>) and was latest in deep lakes located in cool, still regions. The depth effect of stratification break-up is primarily due to the presence of a deeper (and thus of higher volume) upper mixed layer in summer, resulting in lake temperatures being less sensitive to day-to-day changes in atmospheric forcing and thus experiencing a delayed break-up of stratification compared to shallower lakes

 </sup>. In other words, larger lakes stay stratified for longer as both wind-stress and surface heat loss act on a larger volume of water, thus taking longer to erode stratification and induce overturn.
