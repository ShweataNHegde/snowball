<p id="Par8">Lake morphological characteristics (depth and surface area) are also typically considered to be important factors influencing the timing of stratification onset in some lakes, due to the substantial period of convective mixing that typically occurs in large lakes prior to stratification onset in spring

 </sup>. Specifically, in many large Northern Hemisphere lakes, winter lake surface temperatures are typically below the temperature of maximum density (e.g. during ice cover), resulting in an inversely stratified water column and the formation of a colder, less dense upper mixed layer above denser, warmer bottom waters

 </sup>. Springtime heating leads to the loss of lake ice and warms near-surface waters, increasing water density and resulting in convective mixing through a deep volume of water with large thermal inertia. As a result, springtime heating can bring a more rapid rise in lake surface temperature in shallow lakes with smaller thermal inertia. Also, due to the higher surface momentum transfer from near-surface wind in large lakes
