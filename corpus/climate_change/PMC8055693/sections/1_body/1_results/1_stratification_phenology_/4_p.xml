<p id="Par10">Our statistical model was able to explain over 90% of the variability in stratification phenology by a few globally available predictor variables (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>). To explain the remaining variability, factors such as water transparency, which can differ across lakes due to changes in land management practices and precipitation patterns

 </sup>, are not considered in our investigation. Changes in salinity, notably the within-lake vertical salinity gradient, could have an influence on stratification phenology by influencing the vertical density difference. In addition, water residence time is not considered in our study, which could influence the number of days in which a lake is continuously stratified and thus bias our estimates of stratification onset and break-up.
