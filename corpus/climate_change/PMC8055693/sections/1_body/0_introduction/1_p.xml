 </sup>. Lakes in these northern regions experience strong seasonality in climatic forcing, and, as a result, exhibit a pronounced seasonal variation in temperature

 </sup>. In lakes, temperature variations are complex, particularly where the phenomenon of thermal stratification adds an additional impact on biological productivity by directly influencing the size of the trophogenic zone in which photosynthesis takes place and also influencing nutrient supply from deep water
