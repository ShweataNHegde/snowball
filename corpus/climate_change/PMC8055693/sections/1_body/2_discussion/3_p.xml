<p id="Par18">Many of the ecosystem services that lakes provide, ranging from the delivery of drinking water and food to recreation, may be endangered by the projected change in stratification phenology during the twenty-first century, particularly in urbanized and agricultural regions where lakes are already eutrophic. In these regions, a prolonging of lake stratification has been shown to increase the occurrence and intensity of toxic algal blooms

 </sup>, which, as well as influencing the aesthetic appeal of lakes, can lead to mass mortalities of fish and birds, as well as provide a serious health threat for cattle, pets, and humans. Algal blooms rank among some of the main causes of poor water quality issues in lakes and, with the projected increase in water scarcity during the twenty-first century, will become an increasingly important issue in the future as freshwater demands exceed its regional availability. When combined with the host of other human effects on lakes, such as eutrophication

 </sup>, phenological changes in stratification will very likely become a source of additional ecological stress. Immediate actions, such as not only reducing global warming but also mitigating nutrient loads to lakes, are needed to counteract the effects of ongoing and projected fast phenological changes to sustain ecosystem services from lakes worldwide.
