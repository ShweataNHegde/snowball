<p id="Par29">Lake Geneva is a deep (maximum depth 308 m) perialpine lake with a surface area of 580 km
 <sup>2</sup>. Temperature profiles have been recorded at the deepest point of the lake since 1957 by OLA-IS, AnaEE-France, and INRAE, at bi-weekly to monthly frequency. To determine onset and break-up of stratification, we compared the surface water density (i.e. observation closest to the lake surface) with the average water density between 40 and 70 m, the depth at which the lake stratifies seasonally each year
