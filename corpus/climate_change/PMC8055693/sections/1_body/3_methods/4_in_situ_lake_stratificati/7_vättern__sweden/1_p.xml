<p id="Par32">No depth-resolved water temperature data are available for Vättern, the second largest lake by surface area in Sweden. However, long-term daily surface temperature observations, measured at a drinking water intake point in the north-eastern part of the lake, are available since 1955. These data (1955–2017) were published previously by ref.

 </sup> and were updated in this study to 2019. Stratification onset was estimated in Vättern, following the water temperature–density considerations described for the Laurentian Great Lakes, as the first day of year in which the surface water temperature increased above 3.98 °C.
