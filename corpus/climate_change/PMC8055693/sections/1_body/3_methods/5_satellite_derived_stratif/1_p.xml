<p id="Par33">As described above, surface temperature observations can be used as a proxy for lake stratification phenology. Specifically, by identifying the day of year in which lake surface temperatures cross a 3.98 °C threshold, surface temperatures can provide a useful phenological indicator of stratification

 </sup>. Here, the across-lake variability in stratification phenology, as calculated from the model ensembles during the historic period, were compared with those estimated from satellite-derived lake temperatures. Notably, stratification phenology was estimated using lake surface temperatures from the European Space Agency’s Climate Change Initiative (CCI) Lakes project (CCI Lakes;

From these lakes, we selected those situated in the Northern Hemisphere (&gt;30°N) and those large enough for the existence of a 10 × 10 pixel array of pure water surrounding the lake centre, defined as the maximum distance to land, following the recommendations of ref.
