<p id="Par31">Third, we inferred whether the species altitudinal distributions are skewed, that is whether only a small part of the population occurred at high altitudes while the majority of individuals of each species remained downhill or vice versa. A simple approach to this question is to again use a linear regression between the study year and the skewness of the altitudinal distribution within each year (z
 <sub>skew</sub>). To reduce the noise stemming from too low sample sizes when using species records, we calculated the skewness only for study years where a given species occurred in at least five sites of different altitude. The final regression was run over a subset of 28 species, which were recorded in the defined number of sites in at least five different study years. For SDMs we used a skewness weighted by probability in an analogue framework. An uphill shift of parts of the populations should be visible in a decrease of annual skewness values with time. For comparison, we also calculated for each species the total degree of skewness in altitudinal occurrence over all study years. Given that the species distributions are bounded by upper and lower occurrence limits, we expected to see a negative correlation of skewness with the centre of occurrence (approximated by the median) and a negative skewness of uphill and a positive skewness of downhill species.
