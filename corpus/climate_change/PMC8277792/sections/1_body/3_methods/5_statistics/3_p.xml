<p id="Par30">In a second approach, we looked at altitudinal shifts in records and changes in species range sizes along the altitudinal gradient. For each species, we therefore calculated (a) the slope of a linear regression between the year of record and the altitude of the record (z
 <sub>alt</sub>) and (b) the respective slope for the regression between annual range size and study year (z
 <sub>range</sub>). Under the assumption that species shifted their occurrences uphill and their range sizes expand towards higher altitudes, we expected to see a prevalence of positive slopes for both regressions.
