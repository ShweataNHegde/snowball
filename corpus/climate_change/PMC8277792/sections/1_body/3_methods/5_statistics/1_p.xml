<p id="Par28">We use three different approaches to answer our starting questions, each time using the chosen set of 37 species and comparing results obtained from the species records themselves, and the species distribution models. First, we determined for each species the years of maximum (t
 <sub>max</sub>) and minimum (t
 <sub>min</sub>) altitude record for both the species records themselves and the weighted medians of the potential distributions (median altitude weighted by probability). According to our first starting question, we expected to obtain higher altitudinal occurrences in more recent years and lower at the beginning of our analysed time frame. While the species records may be affected by some sort of temporal and spatial sampling biases, SDMs may counterbalance a potential sampling bias by providing annual estimates, but on the other hand be also prone to uncertainties due to climate reconstructions. We expected that both approaches are complementary and thus provide strongest evidence if their results are in concert.
