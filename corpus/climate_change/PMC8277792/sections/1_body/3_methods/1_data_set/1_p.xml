<p id="Par20">We exclusively considered mountain butterflies which have only exceptional occurrences below 600 m a.s.l. in temperate latitudes. Furthermore, we only considered species with sufficient data records for Salzburg over time (i.e. 13). The data used for this study are primarily based on the entomological collection of the “Haus der Natur”, museum of natural sciences in Salzburg (

These data were completed by further records of recent butterfly assessments conducted across our study region, as well as by various literature sources. All species records are stored in the biodiversity database of the “Haus der Natur”. In total, we considered 5836 records from 37 species (i.e. 36 butterfly and one burnet moth species). The data points cover a period from 1960 until 2019. We chose this time window as it contained sufficient local records per year and as it is demarking the onset of Eastern Alpine temperature increase captured by our climate data. We used the following information from each single record: Species name, date of observation, exact location of observation (GPS coordinates), and elevation. Two local entomologists (P. Gros and G. Embacher) recently reviewed the quality of the entire data set. Sources used are compiled in Appendix
