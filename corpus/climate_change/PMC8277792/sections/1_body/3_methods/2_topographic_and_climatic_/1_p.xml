This step was necessary in order to reduce computation time. As we expect only a weak correlation between elevation and precipitation, these variables were downscaled to the same resolution using a bipolar interpolation available in the raster package for R

 </sup>. We acknowledge that the interpolation approach may lead to uncertainties in climate reconstructions. However, due to the strong correlation between elevation and temperature, we are confident to receive realistic scenarios. Furthermore, as we compare the results of our distribution models with those obtained from the species records themselves, we expect to find similar trends using both approaches.
