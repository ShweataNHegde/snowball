 </sup> using the swd-data format as described above. Analogously, random background data were generated by extracting the environmental data from 10,000 records randomly sampled for each year (59,000 in total). For each species, we computed 100 Maxent models randomly splitting the records in 80% used for model training and 20% for model testing using the Area Under the Receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)

 </sup> using a bootstrap approach. Feature classes were restricted to linear, quadratic and product features as initial tests revealed the most realistic, bell shaped response curves. As output format, the cloglog format was used, and final projections of the models to each time slice were rescaled to a range between 0 and 1 using the average 10% training omission threshold across all replicates, i.e. we reclassified all probabilities of occurrence below this threshold to nodata, subtracted the threshold and divided the maximum probability by the score of each gridcell.
