<p id="Par19">Our study provides strong evidence for altitudinal range shifts of mountain butterflies in the eastern Alps. As these changes differ among species, they might result in profound community modifications with possible effects on species interactions and competition among taxa. Our study hereby underlines the high scientific value of long-term data sets to understand past and predict future range changes and biodiversity trends. Nevertheless, we have to consider the limitations of our data set. Thus, our results show strong fluctuations of records over time what might be due to two possible non-exclusive reasons: Firstly, arthropod populations and thus their detectability fluctuate severely among generations and years, as e.g. shown for our study group, the butterflies

 </sup>. Thus, local populations, in particular at the edge of the species’ altitudinal distribution, can easily fall below the detection limit, which may distort results. Secondly, the assessment of butterflies for the here analysed data set has not been performed according to a standardized protocol. Nevertheless, and despite these drawbacks, our study reveals a clear trend in mountain butterfly distributions—towards higher elevations.
