<p id="Par16">Ecological and behavioural aspects (such as species-specific dispersal abilities) are important factors when studying responses on environmental change. In this context, we observed that species with large climatic niches have moved uphill significantly faster than species with narrow niches; species with low dispersal capacity tended to shift their distributions to higher altitudes less than more mobile species. Thus, in general, the species in our survey with more specialised ecological demands have adapted their altitudinal ranges less to the on-going climatic changes than less specialised species. These findings go in line with other studies showing repeatedly that speciesâ€™ responses to environmental changes strongly diverge depending on their specific demands, behaviour and plasticity

 </sup> modelled future distributions of five mountain butterfly species in North America and found that only generalist species (relying on a broad variety of different larval food plants) may benefit from distribution range expansions mediated by climate change. In contrast, the Rocky Mountain Apollo
