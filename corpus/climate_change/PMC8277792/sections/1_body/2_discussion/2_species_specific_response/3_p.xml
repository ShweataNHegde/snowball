<p id="Par18">For these reasons, species-specific responses to climate change may also result in considerable modifications of community structures and may thus shape future community assemblies. Moving to higher altitudes at different velocities may change community composition even within genera

 </sup>. As discussed above, this can disrupt special overlap between herbivores and their food plants, but also may impact interactions among species, such as mutualistic relations between pollinators and flowering plants

 </sup>; however, also the formation of new and intact communities is feasible. In this context, it is also important to emphasise that not only pollinators depend from nectar and pollen sources and phytophages from plant biomass, but that many plant species rely on specific pollinators for their successful reproduction

 </sup>. Consequently, these complex dependencies and interactions underline that not only insects might lack resources, but that also new competitive interactions may be formed, among others by lowland species that expand their distributions uphill into the subalpine and alpine zones with their communities, in addition to the climatic components, potentially deteriorating the living conditions of the mountain species by their competition.
