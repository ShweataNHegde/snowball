<p id="Par17">Coherence between ecological specialisation and dispersal behaviour has been documented repeatedly for European butterflies showing that high mobility is frequently a generalist trait often associated with broad trophic ranges, long flight periods, and other features facilitating survival in changing environments

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup>, as mobility is often inversely related to local population density
