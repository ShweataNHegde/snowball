<p id="Par15">For one of these (i.e. the Purple Bog Fritillary 
 <italic>B. titania</italic>), niche modelling showed that global warming might differently impact the ranges of the butterfly and its most important larval food plant, the common bistort 
 <italic>Bistorta officinalis</italic>. The study predicts a reduction of spatial overlap of the climatic niches of both species, maybe even ending up in an almost complete spatial mismatch with detrimental consequences for the butterfly

 </sup>. This might also apply for other mountain butterflies with larval food plant specialisation, as e.g. shown for the Rocky Mountain Apollo 
 <italic>Parnassius smintheus</italic> and its larval food plant, i.e. several species of 
 <italic>Sedum</italic>, mostly 
 <italic>S. lanceolatum</italic>. Filazzola and colleagues predict a potential distribution expansion of this butterfly in the wake of climate warming. However, by integrating the future distributions of the relevant 
 <italic>Sedum</italic> species (under dry-climate scenarios), a relevant reduction of the realised distribution of the butterfly is more likely in the near future

 </sup>. Severe future geographic mismatches between butterflies and their larval food plants become even more likely against the background of diverging response velocities in both groups: The response of plant species to climate warming is rather moderate and slow if compared with flying insects
