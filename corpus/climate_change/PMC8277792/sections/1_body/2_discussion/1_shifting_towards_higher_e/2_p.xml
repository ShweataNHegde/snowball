<p id="Par14">As one of their consequences, these range modifications may result in spatial mismatches between species on the one hand and abiotic and biotic conditions on the other, thus perhaps leading to disturbances in interactions across trophic levels, such as herbivory, parasitism, and mutualistic relations

 </sup>. This is of particular importance as many of the butterfly species analysed in our study depend on specific habitat types and larval food plants. Thus, the fritillary 
 <italic>Euphydryas intermedia</italic> is restricted to open mountain forest habitats offering the only larval food plant, 
 <italic>Lonicera coerulea</italic>; the Small Apollo 
 <italic>Parnassius phoebus</italic> is mostly found in habitats accompanying fast-flowing mountain streams where the most important larval food plant, 
 <italic>Saxifraga aizoides</italic>, is growing at sparsely vegetated spots; or the Sooty Ringlet 
 <italic>Erebia pluto</italic>, one of the butterflies reaching the highest altitudes, that is mostly restricted to the coarse sandy and sparsely vegetated side and end moraines in the glacier fore-fields (PG, pers. observ.). In addition to these examples of extreme habitat specialisation, several other butterfly species considered in our study are (often strictly) mono- or oligophagous, and thus rely on specific larval food plants for their development, such as e.g. 
 <italic>Boloria titania</italic>, 
 <italic>Pyrgus andromedae</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. warrensis</italic>.
