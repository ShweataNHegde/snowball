<p id="Par13">Our results document significant and constant shifts of butterfly distributions in the eastern Alps towards higher elevations during the past six decades. While the highest altitudinal maxima were mostly observed in more recent years, observations at the respective lowest altitudes are restricted to the period prior to 1980. This translates into an average altitudinal distributional shift of the species of more than 300 m uphill within this comparatively short period of time. These findings correspond with previous studies analysing climate change-driven distributional shifts of butterflies, in altitude
