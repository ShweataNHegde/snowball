<p id="Par9">The potential overall species richness at a given altitude (based on the estimated distributions revealed by their climatic niches) strongly fluctuated throughout the study period. The maximum space covered by the investigated species and hence the highest average species richness throughout the study area was calculated for 1965 with most species finding suitable habitats at comparatively lower altitudes than in 2015, when our models suggested the smallest area occupied by our species (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). These differences are due to a pronounced uphill shift in the potential distributions resulting in shrinking range sizes.
