<p id="Par8">The overall performance of our SDMs was good to very good (AUC
 <sub>training</sub> 0.762–0.980, AUC

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Overall, the temperature related PC1 had the highest contribution, followed by PC2, while the topography related PCs had a low contribution in most models (Supplementary Table
