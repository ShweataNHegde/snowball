<p id="Par6">A species’ niche breadth can be quantified as multidimensional, irregularly shaped volume in the environmental space. Our hypervolume analyses revealed strong differences in realized niche volumina considering both, climate only and climate plus topographic features. Realized climatic niche volumina had the range 5.8–228.8 (mean = 96.1, sd = 53.2, median = 103.9); differences were much more pronounced when topographic variables (i.e. insolation hours and solar irrigation) were included (3.7–25,894.3, mean = 5715.8, sd = 5591.5, median = 3967.7).</p>
