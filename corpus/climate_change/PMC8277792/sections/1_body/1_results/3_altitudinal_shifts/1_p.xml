<p id="Par10">27 of the 37 studied species had their highest observed altitude later than their minimum, resulting in an increase of observations at higher altitudes towards more recent years (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A); the record at the lowest respective altitude was before 1980 for 21 species. The trait distributions did not significantly change along the altitudinal gradient (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref> online). The species distribution models returned qualitatively identical results, predicting higher altitudinal occurrences for 32 of the 37 species in more recent years (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). 22 species were predicted to have their minimum altitudinal occurrences before 1970, while 15 species should have had altitudinal maxima during the last decade (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Although there was no significant correlation between the empirical median altitude and decade, we found a respective high correlation when using the predictions of the species distribution models (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.77; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>F).
