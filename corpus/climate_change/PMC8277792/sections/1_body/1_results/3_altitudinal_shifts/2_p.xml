<p id="Par11">The median altitudes obtained from both data sets were highly correlated (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.82, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A), as were the climatic niche volumes and the environmental niche volumes including both climate and topographic variables (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.72; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). The altitude—study year regression slopes z
 <sub>alt</sub> were positive for all species using both approaches and increased with climate niche breadth (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C, D) implying that particularly species with large climatic niches (i.e. being generalists in this aspect) tended to move uphill more strongly. This trend did not depend on the distribution of the three traits considered, although sedentary species showed the tendency to have comparatively low z
 <sub>alt</sub> values (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C, D). This uphill shift was not significantly related to species altitudinal range sizes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>E, F).
