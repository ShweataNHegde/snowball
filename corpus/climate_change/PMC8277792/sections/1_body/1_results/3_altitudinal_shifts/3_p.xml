<p id="Par12">Species altitudinal range sizes as estimated by Variance-Mean Ratios (VMR) decreased with increasing median altitude using both species records and SDM results (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A, B). In turn, z
 <sub>VMR</sub> slopes increased at higher altitude when using species records (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C), but decreased when using SDM results (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D). However, in both cases the correlations were rather weak. Species occurring mainly at lower altitudes had right skewed and species of higher altitudes left skewed altitudinal distributions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>E, F), but these trends were not sensitively linked to trait distributions (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), although mobile species tended to have comparatively high z
 <sub>VMR</sub> values.
