 </sup>. Climatic conditions have considerably changed all over the world
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>
 </sup>, and major parts of Central Europe are characterised by increasingly hot and dry periods in summer
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
 </sup>. Such changes of climatic conditions modify species community compositions
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>, impacts species interactions
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
 </sup>, and shape species’ distribution ranges, with shifts towards higher altitudes and latitudes
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
 </sup>. Effects from climate change on biodiversity are particularly visible in mountain regions, where species often occupy specific climatic niches, frequently combined with high ecological specialisation, hence making them highly sensitive to environmental changes
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
 </sup>. Most of these species are highly specialized on specific hostplants and to abiotic conditions (e.g. climatic niche); in addition, they are adapted in their evolution to interact with the phenologies of other taxa. Thus, marginal changes of abiotic and biotic conditions can disturb and interrupt inter-specific interactions
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup>. Butterflies are particularly sensitive to environmental changes, such as climatic shifts, because many representatives of this group of species are strictly adapted to certain environmental conditions, and their development depends on certain larval food plants and specific microhabitat structures
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>. Therefore, this group is an ideal study system to investigate recent changes due to climate change. Species respond very differently to changes in their environment depending on their niche breadths
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup>. Studies have shown that species with a broad ecological amplitude can cope significantly better to rapidly occurring environmental changes
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup>. In contrast, specialized species that require very specific resources such as habitat structures, a specific climatic niche, or the presence of a particular larval food plant, may be much more negatively affected by environmental changes
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup>. Dispersal behaviour also plays a central role: Species with a high degree of mobility can respond much better to environmental changes such as habitat degradation and fragmentation or shifts in climate than species with a low propensity to dispersal, which usually remain in one habitat for many generations
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>. To analyse species’ specific responses on climate change, long-term observations in combination with detailed knowledge on species’ ecology, behaviour and life-history are necessary
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup>. Most butterflies are taxonomically and ecologically well understood if compared with other invertebrates
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–
