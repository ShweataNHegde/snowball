<p id="Par3">In this study, we analyse distributional trends of mountain butterflies (also including one burnet moth species) of the Federal State of Salzburg in northern Austria, Central Europe for the past six decades. Our study region represents a pronounced altitudinal gradient ranging from less than 400 m a.s.l. to almost 4000 m a.s.l. This region is strongly affected by climate change during the past few decades

 </sup>, with well-visible effects on biodiversity, as evident by studies on the alpine vegetation

 </sup>. Extensive records of butterfly observations exist over several decades and have been compiled into a database, including exact date of observation and its exact location and elevation. In addition, detailed information on the species’ ecology, behaviour and life history exist for most butterfly species and were compiled from various literature sources

 </sup>. Hereby we paid special attention to the ecological specialization as well as the dispersal behaviour of the butterflies. This compilation of information and records forms the basis to test responses of mountain butterflies to climate warming over time. We address the following research questions:

   <p id="Par5">What are the characteristics (dispersal behaviour, ecological specialisation) of these butterfly species that make them either more resilient or sensitive to climate warming?</p>
