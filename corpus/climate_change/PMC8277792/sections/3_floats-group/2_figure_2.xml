  <p>Relationships between the years of minimum and maximum observed (
   <bold>A</bold>) and modelled (
   <bold>B</bold>) altitudinal occurrences for 37 mountain butterfly species. The black line denotes the 1:1 relationship. Observed (
   <bold>C</bold>) and modelled (
   <bold>D</bold>) numbers of species with their minimum (light grey bars) and maximum (dark grey) observed elevation of occurrence in a focal decade. Median altitudinal shift per decade revealed by the median altitudinal position of each species within a decade minus the median over the complete study period as evident from species records (
   <bold>E</bold>) and species distribution models (
   <bold>F</bold>); this analysis was performed for all species. The coefficient of determination R
