  <p>Relationship between median altitude of species records and median altitude derived from the species distribution models weighted by probability (
   <bold>A</bold>). Relationship between the niche volumes computed based on climatic components only and both climate and topography (
   <bold>B</bold>). Slopes of altitudinal shift z
   <sub>alt</sub> increased with increasing climate niche using both the species records (
   <bold>C</bold>) and the median altitude per species weighted by SDM probability (
   <bold>D</bold>). Slopes of range size shifts z
   <sub>range</sub> showed no correlation with the climate niche volume using both species records and SDM results (
   <bold>E, F</bold>). R
