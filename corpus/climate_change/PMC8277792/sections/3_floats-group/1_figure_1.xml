  <p>Differences in species richness patterns across the most extreme years 1965 and 2015. PC1-3 refer to the climate related principal components, which were used to train the SDMs (for factor loadings see Supplementary Table 
   <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref> online); dTemp refers to the deviation of the annual mean temperature of a specific year relative to the median conditions 1961â€“2019. Density profiles represent the predicted potential distribution per species in different altitudes. Map projection is Lambert Conformal Conic 2SP.
