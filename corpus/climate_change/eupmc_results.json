It is suggested that the diversity of pessimistic and optimistic views is due to the uncertainty of scientific climate models and the influence of evaluative and ideological assumptions.", "Keywords": ["Climate change", "Uncertainty", "Mitigation", "Pessimism", "Optimism", "Ideology"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8265714?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Journal of agricultural & environmental ethics", "title": "Pessimism and Optimism in the Debate on Climate Change: A Critical Analysis."}, "PMC8277792": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "34257364", "source": "MED", "pmid": "34257364", "pmcid": "PMC8277792", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC8277792"}, "doi": "10.1038/s41598-021-93826-0", "title": "Climate change drives mountain butterflies towards the summits.", "authorString": "R\u00f6dder D, Schmitt T, Gros P, Ulrich W, Habel JC.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "R\u00f6dder D", "firstName": "Dennis", "lastName": "R\u00f6dder", "initials": "D", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Zoologisches Forschungsmuseum Alexander Koenig, Adenauerallee 160, 53113, Bonn, Germany."}}}, {"fullName": "Schmitt T", "firstName": "Thomas", "lastName": "Schmitt", "initials": "T", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": [{"affiliation": "Senckenberg German Entomological Institute, Eberswalder Stra\u00dfe 90, 15374, M\u00fcncheberg, Germany."}, {"affiliation": "Department of Zoology, Faculty of Natural Sciences I, Institute of Biology, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, 06099, Halle (Saale), Germany."}, {"affiliation": "Entomology and Biogeography, Institute of Biochemistry and Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Potsdam, 14476, Potsdam, Germany."}]}}, {"fullName": "Gros P", "firstName": "Patrick", "lastName": "Gros", "initials": "P", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Haus der Natur, Museumsplatz 5, 5020, Salzburg, Austria."}}}, {"fullName": "Ulrich W", "firstName": "Werner", "lastName": "Ulrich", "initials": "W", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Ecology and Biogeography, Nicolaus Copernicus University PL-Toru\u0144, 87-100, Toru\u0144, Poland."}}}, {"fullName": "Habel JC", "firstName": "Jan Christian", "lastName": "Habel", "initials": "JC", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Evolutionary Zoology, Department of Biosciences, University of Salzburg, 5020, Salzburg, Austria.

"abstractText": "The Arctic is undergoing rapid and accelerating change in response to global warming, altering biodiversity patterns, and ecosystem function across the region. For Arctic endemic species, our understanding of the consequences of such change remains limited. Spectacled eiders (<i>Somateria fischeri</i>), a large Arctic sea duck, use remote regions in the Bering Sea, Arctic Russia, and Alaska throughout the annual cycle making it difficult to conduct comprehensive surveys or demographic studies. Listed as Threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, understanding the species response to climate change is critical for effective conservation policy and planning. Here, we developed an integrated population model to describe spectacled eider population dynamics using capture-mark-recapture, breeding population survey, nest survey, and environmental data collected between 1992 and 2014. Our intent was to estimate abundance, population growth, and demographic rates, and quantify how changes in the environment influenced population dynamics. Abundance of spectacled eiders breeding in western Alaska has increased since listing in 1993 and responded more strongly to annual variation in first-year survival than adult survival or productivity. We found both adult survival and nest success were highest in years following intermediate sea ice conditions during the wintering period, and both demographic rates declined when sea ice conditions were above or below average. In recent years, sea ice extent has reached new record lows and has remained below average throughout the winter for multiple years in a row.

For Arctic endemic species, our understanding of the consequences of such change remains limited. Spectacled eiders (<i>Somateria fischeri</i>), a large Arctic sea duck, use remote regions in the Bering Sea, Arctic Russia, and Alaska throughout the annual cycle making it difficult to conduct comprehensive surveys or demographic studies. Listed as Threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, understanding the species response to climate change is critical for effective conservation policy and planning. Here, we developed an integrated population model to describe spectacled eider population dynamics using capture-mark-recapture, breeding population survey, nest survey, and environmental data collected between 1992 and 2014. Our intent was to estimate abundance, population growth, and demographic rates, and quantify how changes in the environment influenced population dynamics. Abundance of spectacled eiders breeding in western Alaska has increased since listing in 1993 and responded more strongly to annual variation in first-year survival than adult survival or productivity. We found both adult survival and nest success were highest in years following intermediate sea ice conditions during the wintering period, and both demographic rates declined when sea ice conditions were above or below average. In recent years, sea ice extent has reached new record lows and has remained below average throughout the winter for multiple years in a row. Sea ice persistence is expected to further decline in the Bering Sea. Our results indicate spectacled eiders may be vulnerable to climate change and the increasingly variable sea ice conditions throughout their wintering range with potentially deleterious effects on population dynamics.

We argue that new sequencing technologies and the use of historical samples are opening unprecedented opportunities to investigate genome-wide responses to changing environments. However, there are important challenges in interpreting the emerging findings. First, it is essential to differentiate genetic adaptation from phenotypic plasticity.

food, and fodder in India. It is grown in marginal arid and semi-arid agro-ecosystems with wide yield fluctuations due to spatial variability of rainfall and soil. Climate change, which is predicted to increase the intra- and inter-annual rainfall variability will further constrain the groundnut economy in India besides the global and domestic economic, social and policy changes. Through this study we aim to examine the biophysical and social economic impacts of climate change on groundnut production and prices to provide a comprehensive analysis of how agriculture and the food system will be affected. Using projected climate data for India, we estimated the biophysical impacts of climate change on groundnut during mid-century using representative concentration pathway (RCP 8.5) scenario. We examined the impacts of changes in population and income besides environmental factors on groundnut productivity.

The recent developments and perspectives discussed throughout this review ultimately aim to contribute to increased crop adaptability and yield in the face of heat waves and drought events.", "Keywords": ["Ex situ conservation", "Genetic Adaptation", "Abiotic Stress Tolerance", "Genebanks", "Machine Learning (Ml)", "Genome-Wide Selection Scans (Gwss)", "Germplasm Collections", "Genome\u2013environment Associations (Gea)", "Genomic Prediction (Gp)"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8161384?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Genes", "authorinfo": ["Cort\u00e9s AJ", "L\u00f3pez-Hern\u00e1ndez F"], "title": "Harnessing Crop Wild Diversity for Climate Change Adaptation."}, "PMC7812774": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "33431560", "source": "MED", "pmid": "33431560", "pmcid": "PMC7812774", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC7812774"}, "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2002543117", "title": "Insects and recent climate change.", "authorString": "Halsch CA, Shapiro AM, Fordyce JA, Nice CC, Thorne JH, Waetjen DP, Forister ML.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Halsch CA", "firstName": "Christopher A", "lastName": "Halsch", "initials": "CA", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-1381-1905"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Biology, Program in Ecology, Evolution and Conservation Biology, University of Nevada, Reno, NV 89557."}}}, {"fullName": "Shapiro AM", "firstName": "Arthur M", "lastName": "Shapiro", "initials": "AM", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-1933-9077"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Center for Population Biology, University of California, Davis, CA 95616."}}}, {"fullName": "Fordyce JA", "firstName": "James A", "lastName": "Fordyce", "initials": "JA", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-2731-0418"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996."}}}, {"fullName": "Nice CC", "firstName": "Chris C", "lastName": "Nice", "initials": "CC", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-9930-6891"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Biology, Population and Conservation Biology Program, Texas State University, San Marcos, TX 78666."}}}, {"fullName": "Thorne JH", "firstName": "James H", "lastName": "Thorne", "initials": "JH", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-9130-9921"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Policy, University of California, Davis, CA 95616."}}}, {"fullName": "Waetjen DP", "firstName": "David P", "lastName": "Waetjen", "initials": "DP", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-5817-3279"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Policy, University of California, Davis, CA 95616."}}}, {"fullName": "Forister ML", "firstName": "Matthew L", "lastName": "Forister", "initials": "ML", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-2765-4779"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Biology, Program in Ecology, Evolution and Conservation Biology, University of Nevada, Reno, NV 89557; mforister@unr.edu."}}}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": [{"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-5817-3279"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-9930-6891"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-1933-9077"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-2731-0418"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-9130-9921"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-1381-1905"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-2765-4779"}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": ["supporting_data", "altmetrics"]}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "2", "volume": "118", "journalIssueId": "3080321", "dateOfPublication": "2021 Jan", "monthOfPublication": "1", "yearOfPublication": "2021", "printPublicationDate": "2021-01-01", "journal": {"title": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "ISOAbbreviation": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "medlineAbbreviation": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "NLMid": "7505876", "ISSN": "0027-8424", "ESSN": "1091-6490"}}, "pubYear": "2021", "abstractText": "Insects have diversified through more than 450 million y of Earth's changeable climate, yet rapidly shifting patterns of temperature and precipitation now pose novel challenges as they combine with decades of other anthropogenic stressors including the conversion and degradation of land.

Thus, this study aims to provide a quantitative risk assessment of the impact of climate change on suitability of five premium specialty coffees in Ethiopia. We implement an ensemble model of three machine learning algorithms to predict current and future (2030s, 2050s, 2070s, and 2090s) suitability for each specialty coffee under four Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs). Results show that the importance of variables determining coffee suitability in the combined model is different from those for specialty coffees despite the climatic factors remaining more important in determining suitability than topographic and soil variables.

With ongoing climate change, the frequency and types of snow avalanches may change, affecting the rates of avalanche burial and survival. With a wetter and warmer snow climate, consequences of burial may become more severe. In this review, we assess the potential effects of climate change on the frequency and characteristics of avalanches. We then discuss how these changes might affect the survival rates of subjects buried by avalanches and might influence the responses of search and rescue (SAR) teams and health care providers. While climate change is inevitable, the effects on avalanches remain elusive. The frequency of human triggered avalanches may not change, because this depends largely on the number and behavior of winter recreationists. Blunt trauma and secondary injuries will likely become more frequent as terrain roughness is expected to rise and snow cover to become thinner.

With ongoing climate change, the frequency and types of snow avalanches may change, affecting the rates of avalanche burial and survival. With a wetter and warmer snow climate, consequences of burial may become more severe. In this review, we assess the potential effects of climate change on the frequency and characteristics of avalanches. We then discuss how these changes might affect the survival rates of subjects buried by avalanches and might influence the responses of search and rescue (SAR) teams and health care providers. While climate change is inevitable, the effects on avalanches remain elusive. The frequency of human triggered avalanches may not change, because this depends largely on the number and behavior of winter recreationists. Blunt trauma and secondary injuries will likely become more frequent as terrain roughness is expected to rise and snow cover to become thinner. Higher snow densities in avalanche debris will likely interfere with the respiration of completely buried victims. Asphyxia and trauma, as causes of avalanche death, may increase. It is unlikely that SAR and health care providers involved in avalanche rescue will have to change their strategies in areas where they are already established.
