  <p>Potential threats posed by release of ancient pathogens from permanently-frozen environments. Ancient pathogens (or microbes carrying potentially harmful genetic elements, such as antibiotic-resistance plasmids or integrons), are released massively when ice melts, due to global warming. Once reactivated (or resurrected), these microbes enter natural environments, close to human settlements, posing serious threats to plant-, animal- and human health</p>
