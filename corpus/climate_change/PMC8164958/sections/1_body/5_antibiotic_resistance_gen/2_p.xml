<p id="Par23">Antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) have been frequently detected in ancient bacteria isolated from permanently frozen environments. For instance, Mindlin et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2008</xref>) cultured bacterial strains from Eastern Siberian permafrost sediments, estimated to be up to 3-million-years-old; many of these strains harbored genes encoding resistance towards several antibiotics (e.g. chloramphenicol, gentamicin, kanamycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, and mercury compounds). Similarly, bacteria recovered and cultured from 3.5-million-years-old permafrost samples collected at Central Yakutia (Russia), were also shown to carry multiple ARGs (Kashuba et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2017</xref>). One of them, a 
 <italic>Staphylococcus hominis</italic> MMP2 strain, harbored ARGs &gt; 96% identical to genes conferring resistance to beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, phenicols and MLS (macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B).
