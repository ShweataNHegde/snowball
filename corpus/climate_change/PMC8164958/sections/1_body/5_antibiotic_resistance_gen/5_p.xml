<p id="Par26">Sequence-based metagenomics has been the preferred strategy to detect many of these ARGs or complex genetic elements, and to predict the resistant potential of microbial communities colonizing pristine ecosystems (Schmieder and Edwards 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2012</xref>). Alternatively, functional metagenomics allowed identifying ARGs whose similarity to nucleotidic sequences in databases might not be obvious, by expressing them in heterologous hosts. This experimental approach, althoughÂ more laborious, has also helped to apprehend the diversity of environmental genes, genetic elements and mechanisms behind resistance to antibiotics in ecosystems not subjected to anthropogenic disturbances. Both approaches had permitted to reveal that ancient ARGs predate the use of antibiotics for therapeutic purposes (Perry et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2016</xref>). There is also undisputable evidence that many ARGs, found today in pathogenic microorganisms, have arisen from the environmental
