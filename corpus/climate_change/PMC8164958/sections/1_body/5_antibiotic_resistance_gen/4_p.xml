<p id="Par25">Particularly relevant (and worrying) is the occurrence of bacteria carrying integrons, in samples collected from distant and remote glaciers. These complex genetic elements are capable of capturing genes and gene cassettes, frequently encoding for antibiotic resistance; more importantly, integrons can be transferred horizontally within a microbial community as part of other mobile genetic elements, like plasmids and transposons (Gillings

The transposon, conferring resistance to several antibiotics and chromate, included a class 1 integron, which was considered as the first example of its kind that originated in the “pre-antibiotic” era. More recently, Makowska et al. (
