Hence, it has been proposed that more efforts should be made to test the hypothesis that some of these ancient ARGs might be transmitted to modern microbes by horizontal gene transfer (HGT); it has also been highlighted the importance to measure the rate of these HGT events, as well as to assess the environmental factors contributing to such genetic exchange (Wright
