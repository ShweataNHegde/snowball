<p id="Par28">A landmark in the study of ancient ARGs was the isolation—in 2008—and subsequent sequencing—in 2014—of plasmids extracted from ancient permafrost bacteria, aged 15,000 to 40,000 years-old (Petrova et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2009</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2014</xref>). One of these plasmids contained streptomycin and tetracycline resistance determinants, which were transferred to “modern” plasmids, confirming their ability to spread into contemporary natural bacterial populations. More recently, another study confirmed the presence of ARG-containing plasmids in ancient permafrost bacteria (Kurakov et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2016</xref>).
