<p id="Par13">Permafrost can be defined as a mixture of soil, sediment and gravel bound together by ice, whose temperature remains below 0 °C for at least two consecutive years (Brown et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1998</xref>). It covers approximately one fourth of the terrestrial surface on Earth (i.e. 27%) and is found at high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Alaska, Siberia, Greenland, and the northern regions of Canada, Norway and Sweden (Schaefer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2012</xref>). Permafrost can also be found in Antarctica and in alpine regions of Asia, South America and Northern Europe. Due to climate change, the temperature of permafrost has increased steadily since 1980, melting the superficial layers and shallowing the depth of frozen ground (Vaughan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2013</xref>). It has been estimated that permafrost will melt more rapidly in the coming years, a phenomenon that will seriously modify its stability (Ding et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2019</xref>).
