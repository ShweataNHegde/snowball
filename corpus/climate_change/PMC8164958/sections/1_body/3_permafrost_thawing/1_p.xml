<p id="Par12">On May 29th 2020 an oil tank in Siberia collapsed and released 21,000 tons of oil, polluting the Ambarnaya River and affecting an area of 180.000 m
 <sup>2</sup>. More recently, in September 2020, a giant hole of more than 50Â m deep formed at the Yamal Peninsula and released tons of methane into the atmosphere. Both events were linked by a common phenomenon: the rapid thawing of permafrost.
