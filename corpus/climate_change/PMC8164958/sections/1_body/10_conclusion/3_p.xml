<p id="Par50">Only four years ago, a scientific hypothesis related the extinction of Neanderthal populations with an infection of either viral or bacterial origin (Houldcroft and Underdown 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2016</xref>). Although this hypothesis was received with skepticism at first, it is gaining an unexpected support at a time when humanity faces a pandemic of dramatic consequences. This further reinforces the concern that many feel about the possible re-emergence of infectious diseases, coming from the depths of thawing glaciers and permafrost, and thought to be eradicated from the Earthâ€™s surface thousands or millions of years ago. Without reaching such extremes, it cannot be excluded that if we continue to disturb the stability of these ecosystems by modifying the global climate, the possibility of coming into contact with any of these ice-entrapped pathogens will increase substantially. This will also happen if we continue to go deeper, farther and for longer periods into the frozen territories for scientific, commercial or touristic reasons. Since this seems impossible to avoid, we shall be at least prepared for what might happen.
