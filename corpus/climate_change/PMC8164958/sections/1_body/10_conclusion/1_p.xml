<p id="Par48">Melting of the Earth’s cryosphere is occurring at an unprecedented rate, since the beginning of the 21st century. Despite repeated warnings by international organizations, the tendency of this global disaster seems unstoppable. Thus, tons of microbes immured for millennia in glacial ice or permafrost, many of which are either closely related to human and animal pathogens, are being reactivated and released into aquatic and terrestrial environments. Hence, as shown by recent outbreaks of diseases caused by supposed to be extinct microbial pathogens immured in glacial ice for centuries, there is a serious risk for future epidemics (or even pandemics) to happen more often.</p>
