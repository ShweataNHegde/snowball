<p id="Par36">On the other hand, very limited information has been published about the acquisition of viral auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) by psychrophilic or psychrotolerant microbes. This is particularly relevant from a public health perspective because, in addition to improve resistance to frozen environments, AMGs could also provide microbes with new, potentially virulent genes. For instance, this is the case of the genes encoding the Shiga toxins in certain pathogenic strains of
