<p id="Par37">In addition, efforts should be made to generate critical information to distinguish between the

However, the information about the infectious potential of these viruses is still scarce. In fact, as stated by Rassner et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2016</xref>), frozen habitats are characterized by harsh environmental conditions that may strongly affect the ability of viruses to infect microbes. Also, viral genomes are susceptible to damage caused by high UV radiance and extremely low temperatures, two conditions present in glacial environments. Therefore, the infectivity of viruses entrapped in frozen environments should be demonstrated experimentally and without a doubt, by using rigorous and accurate laboratory methodologies, and proper biological models of infection,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2019</xref>). An example of such experimental approach is the study conducted in 2016 by Filippova and co-workers, to determine the occurrence of bacteriophages on the water column of a permanently ice-covered and oligotrophic lake in East Antarctica. The authors found a high diversity of bacteriophages with the ability to undergo a lysogenic cycle on modern bacteria, which indicated that the phage populations present in this frozen lake were, indeed, infective at extremely low temperatures.
