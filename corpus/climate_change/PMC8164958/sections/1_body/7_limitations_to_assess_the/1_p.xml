<p id="Par35">As we can see, efforts have been made to try understanding the community composition and ecological niches of viruses in glacial ecosystems; unfortunately, we are still far from having a comprehensive knowledge concerning the role played by glacial viromes in frozen environments. Although it does not seem obvious at first glance, it is not an easy task to characterize viromes by culture-independent approaches (like metagenomics). This is because, contrary to what happens in the case of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, there are no universal molecular markers to perform a targeted search of viral genomes.</p>
