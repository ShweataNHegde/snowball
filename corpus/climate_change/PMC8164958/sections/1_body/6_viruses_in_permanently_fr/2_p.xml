<p id="Par31">Pioneer studies about ice-immured viruses were published more than 20 years ago, and relied on visual detection of virus-like particles (VLP) by means of electron microscopy techniques (Wilson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">2000</xref>). For instance, Castello et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1999</xref>) detected tomato mosaic tobamovirus particles in  500 to approximately 140,000-year-old ice cores. A few years later, Priscu et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2006</xref>) discovered viral particles in ice cores collected from Antarctica, at more than 2.5 km depth above Lake Vostok, with an estimated age of several million years. Similarly, Castello et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2005</xref>) detected bacteriophages capable of infecting 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> strains in ice cores collected at great depth in Greenland, with an estimated age of 500–100,000 years. The same year, Zhang et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2006</xref>) reported on the presence of influenza-A virus particles in ice and water samples from three Siberian lakes. This study further demonstrated the ability of viruses to withstand the extreme conditions imposed by cold and/or permanently frozen environments.
