<p id="Par32">In 2015, the presence of a wide variety of viruses in glacial environments was indisputably confirmed. In their work, Bellas et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2015</xref>) used massive parallel sequencing techniques to detect the presence of highly novel and diverse viral sequences in cryoconite holes, on the surface of Svalbard glaciers and also in the Greenland platform. A similar study, conducted by Paéz-Espino et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2016</xref>), allowed the identification of 125,000 partial viral genomes from 3,042 samples collected worldwide, including Antarctica. Further, Rassner et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2016</xref>) demonstrated that viruses carried by glacier streams are resilient to variations in temperature, and remain active during long periods of time, being able to infect bacteria in aquatic environments located downstream. Even more recently, Zhong et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2020</xref>) developed a method to concentrate viral particles from glacier ice samples, and subsequently to extract and purify viral DNA. This allowed them to characterize the viromes present in ice samples from the Guliya glacier, on the Tibetan plateau (with an estimated age of 500 and 15,000 years), by using massive parallel sequencing. Their results revealed the presence of 33 viral populations (including 28 new viral genera, unknown to date), half of which represent bacteriophages likely capable of infecting bacteria.
