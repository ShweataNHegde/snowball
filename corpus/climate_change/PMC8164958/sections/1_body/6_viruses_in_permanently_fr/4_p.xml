<p id="Par33">Giant viruses infecting amoeboids have also been detected and resurrected from frozen environments. Since their discovery in 1992, these viruses, able to infect protists and microalgae, have been isolated from diverse environments (La Scola et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2003</xref>; Aherfi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2016</xref>). Noticeably, it is increasingly acknowledged that giant viruses could have an important impact on human health (Brandes and Linial
