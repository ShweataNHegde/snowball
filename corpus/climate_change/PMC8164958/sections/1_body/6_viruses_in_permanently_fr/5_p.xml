<p id="Par34">In 2014 and 2015, Legendre and co-workers isolated two giant viruses, namely 
 <italic>Pithovirus sibericum</italic> and 
 <italic>Mollivirus sibericum</italic>, from &gt; 30,000-year-old ice samples collected in the Siberian permafrost. Both viruses were shown to be infective by following their propagation in axenic cultures of a modern strain of 
 <italic>Acanthamoeba castellanii.</italic> Approximately at the same time, Ng et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2014</xref>) used metagenomics to detect DNA and RNA viruses, preserved in in a subarctic ice patch in frozen caribou feces. One of them, a DNA virus distantly related to plant- and fungi-infecting viruses, was able to infect the plant 
 <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> when tested using a reverse genetics approach.
