<p id="Par30">Viral communities (= “viromes”) colonizing permanently frozen habitats exhibit astonishing taxonomic- and functional diversities; they also play paramount roles regulating the population dynamics of prokaryotic communities, and consequently, the biogeochemical cycles occurring within frozen environments (Rassner et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2016</xref>). The amount of virus-like-particles (VLP) in different glacial environments have been estimated to range between 0.9 × 10

 <sup>7</sup> ml
 <sup>−1</sup> (Wilson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">2000</xref>). Even though some of them can survive intracellularly within their natural hosts in frozen environments (e.g. the giant viruses of amoeboids mentioned earlier), others can be preserved abiotically in ice, as demonstrated by Shoham et al. (
