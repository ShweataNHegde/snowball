<p id="Par40">In fact, when dealing with permanently frozen environments, contamination of ice cores with modern DNA (or modern microorganisms) can be really hard to prevent. It is therefore essential to follow some strict rules in order to authenticate results from studies of ancient DNA, recovered from any kind of samples. In 2000, Cooper and Poinar summarized nine essential criteria to be followed by any researcher working with this type of genetic material. Even though others called for a more cognitive approach (Gilbert et al.
