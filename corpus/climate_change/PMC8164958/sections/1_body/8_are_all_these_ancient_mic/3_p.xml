<p id="Par41">Processing very old ice samples is also a major issue that requires to follow stringent protocols that guarantee the absence of any undesirable contamination. Several decontamination procedures have been developed by Rogers et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2004a</xref>) and Christner et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2005</xref>) to remove all possible contaminants from the sample’ surfaces; these protocols have been further used by different groups (D’Elia et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2008</xref>; Knowlton et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2013</xref>; Miteva et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2016</xref>). However, no approach is meticulous enough and, recently, some modifications have been introduced to improve the performance of these protocols. For example, a new ultra-clean protocol for ancient glacial ice decontamination was developed by Zhong et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2020</xref>). The three-step procedure included band saw scrapping, ethanol washing and sterile water washing of the ice cores, before reaching non-contaminated-, “inner ice” layers. The same year, Saidi-Mehrabad et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2020</xref>) proposed a slightly different procedure to remove contaminants and extract DNA from permafrost samples with low biomass. Again, it combined bleaching, washing, and scraping of the samples, before conducting further experiments.
