<p id="Par39">Following publication of the discovery of influenza-A viruses in Siberian lakesâ€™ ice (Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2006</xref>), some concerns were raised that disputed the validity of these results. Indeed, by performing a rigorous phylogenetic analysis, Worobey (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">2008</xref>) concluded that these viruses were contaminants derived from the same laboratory and argued against considering glaciers as virus reservoirs or repositories. Even though it was shown later that avian influenza viruses are markedly cryostable (Shoham et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2012</xref>), the debate highlighted the importance of implementing rigorous protocols to avoid false conclusions concerning isolation and reactivation of ancient microbes.
