 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2019</xref>) estimated that, in a 14-year period from 2002 to 2016, continental glaciers lost collectively 199 ± 32 Gt of their global mass per year, contributing to an 8 mm rise in the level of the sea. In the Tropical Andes, a massive decay of glacier ice has occurred so fast that some glaciers have already disappeared (they became “extinct”) and many other will vanish in the next few years (Rabatel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2017</xref>). In this region of South America, glaciers lost 1.0 ± 05 Gt/year between 2000 and 2018 (Dussaillant et al.
