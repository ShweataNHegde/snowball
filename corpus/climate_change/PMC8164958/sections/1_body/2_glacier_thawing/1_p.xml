<p id="Par8">Glaciers cover about one tenth of the land surface worldwide, accumulating approximately 170,000 km
 <sup>3</sup> of ice (Huss and Farinotti 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2012</xref>). Owing to their extreme conditions they were initially thought to be devoid of life. Nowadays, it is acknowledged that glaciers contain myriads of microorganisms, many of which are metabolically active and multiplying, although at very low rates; these microbes are confined to the small veins formed between ice crystals, where they benefit from the presence of liquid water and enough nutrients to sustain their basal metabolism for a long time (Price 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2000</xref>). Glacier ice also harbor a huge diversity of 
 <italic>dormant</italic> or 
 <italic>anabiotic</italic> microorganisms (Anesio et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2017</xref>). This means that, even though these microorganisms perform basal metabolic functions and do not multiply, they may 
 <italic>reactivate</italic> when the environment becomes more 
 <italic>friendly</italic>. The existence of such aÂ vast number of microorganisms in glaciers explains why many consider them as true 
 <italic>repositories</italic> of microbial life, both ancient and modern (Miteva
