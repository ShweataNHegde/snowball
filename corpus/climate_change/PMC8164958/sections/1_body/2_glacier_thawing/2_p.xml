<p id="Par9">On the other hand, glaciers are not homogeneous environments. In fact, at least three different ecosystems have been proposed to co-exist in a glacier: a supraglacial ecosystem, an englacial ecosystem and a subglacial ecosystem. All of them differ in several physicochemical parameters, including water content, solar radiation, nutrient abundance, pH and redox potential (Hodson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2008</xref>; Anesio et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2017</xref>). Due to the technical and logistic difficulties to reach the subsurface layers of a glacier, the englacial and subglacial ecosystems have been much less studied than the supraglacial one. This is regrettable, because the great majority of

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2013</xref>; Fegel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2016</xref>). These microbe-loaded running waters quit the glacier as proglacial streams, and can travel long distances until they reach aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, where they may cause a tremendous impact by disturbing their microbial diversity and community composition (Sommaruga
