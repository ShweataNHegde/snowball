<p id="Par6">The cryosphere is the portion of the Earth where water is permanently frozen, mainly in the form of glaciers and ice sheets (Vaughan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2013</xref>). Thus, the term cryosphere is intimately related to the hydrosphere, but typically refers to poly-extreme environments characterized by extremely low temperatures, high UV radiation index, oligotrophy, and low water activity. This not onlyÂ encompasses sea ice, lake ice, river ice, ice caps, ice sheets, frozen ground, glaciers and permafrost, but also seasonal snow.
