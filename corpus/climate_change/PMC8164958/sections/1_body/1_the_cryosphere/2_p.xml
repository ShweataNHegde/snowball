<p id="Par7">According to the most recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2019</xref>), the cryosphere is experiencing widespread, dramatic and pervasive changes, which can be observed and monitored from high mountains to the polar regions, to coasts and to the deep oceans. More recently, Slater et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2021</xref>) combined satellite observations and numerical models and quantified the global ice loss in about 28 trillion tons, from 1994 to 2017. In the last few years, several major events that occurred all around the world seem to confirm this trend (Table S1). The effects of such a gigantic ice loss on humans will be profound, and the societies will be forced to adapt to new and unexpected threats. As we will see, the consequences of the rapid melting of the cryosphere can go well beyond hydrological and climate changes.
