<p id="Par4">It is a well-known fact that outbreaks caused by emerging pathogens originate most often from (1) the invasion of virgin territories by humans, or (2) close contact between humans and wildlife removed from its natural ecosystems. Nowadays, there is increasing concern about a third form of interaction between humans and potential emerging pathogens: the destruction or disappearance of natural barriers, many of which acted as ecological filters for millennia, isolating pristine and remote ecosystems from humans, animals and plants (Harding et al.
