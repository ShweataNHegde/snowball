From a more rational and objective point of view, the occurrence of outbreaks caused by pathogens hitherto unknown, has highlighted the need to implement new surveillance strategies. In this regard, it is critical to complement the surveillance of “animal reservoirs” of pathogens (both natural and accidental) with the study of “ecosystem reservoirs”. Therefore, studies of microorganisms in glaciers and permafrost could help us to take a glimpse into the future, by understanding and anticipating the potential threats we will face when the confined pathomes, viromes and resistomes are released from their confinement.
