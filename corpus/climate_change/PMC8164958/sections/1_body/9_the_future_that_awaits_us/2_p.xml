<p id="Par43">In 2004, Alvin Smith and his colleagues raised the worrying hypothesis that glacial environments could act as reservoirs of viruses pathogenic for humans. At the time it was formulated, the experimental evidence supporting this proposal was rather circumstantial, and based on the following arguments: (1) the detection of microorganisms in glacial ice cores; (2) the enormous density of viral particles in water and its close interaction with glaciers (particularly at the poles); and, (3) the constant release of micro-droplets containing viral particles, from the sea surface into the atmosphere, and their subsequent transport by the wind over long distances. Nowadays, there is almost no doubt that Smith et al. were right.</p>
