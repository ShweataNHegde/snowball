<p id="Par44">According to Rogers et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2004b</xref>) and Edwards (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2015</xref>), the interaction which is currently taking place between ice-released ancient microorganisms and modern living beings may pose serious threats to other forms of life. Not only because pathogenic microbes are released from melting glaciers and permafrost, but also because their genes and genomes are also being disseminated in natural ecosystems; these genetic elements can be subsequently acquired by horizontal gene transfer by other contemporary species (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). This exchange of genes and mobile genetic elements (plasmids, transposons, integrons, etc.) between ancient and modern microorganisms, has been termed “genome turnover” (Rogers et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2004a</xref>). This turnover normally occurs at a very high rate among microorganisms that co-exist in a given habitat, and may even trespass the barriers that exist between the three domains of life (Soucy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2015</xref>). However, even though the scientific evidence is outstanding, the information concerning the potential threat posed by this “global resistome” is still scarce (Perry et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2016</xref>). Also limited is our knowledge about the role played by glacial environments as natural reservoirs of resistomes. Therefore, there is an urgent need to increase our efforts to better understand the possible consequences of the release of such massive amounts of ARGs (Surette and Wright 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2017</xref>).
