<p id="Par46">Not long ago, the concern about the potential threat posed to global public health by the glacial 
 <italic>pathome</italic> (that is, all potentially pathogenic microorganisms trapped in glaciers worldwide) (Roossinck and Garc√≠a-Arenal 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2015</xref>) received unexpected support from a fortuitous event. In July 2016, an outbreak of Anthrax took place in Yamal, Russia, that decimated a population of reindeers, killed a child and forced the hospitalization of more than a hundred pastors (Hueffer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2020</xref>). The 
 <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> strain at the origin of this outbreak was shown to be identical to other strains isolated from the tissues of dead animals immured for centuries in the Siberian permafrost, until it thawed due to global warming (Timofeev et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2019</xref>).
