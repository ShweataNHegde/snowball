<p id="Par45">A few outstanding examples, that clearly illustrate the threat posed to native communities by non-native pathogens, have been recently highlighted by Howenhyuse et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2018</xref>). In all of them, the effects on animal biodiversity (e.g. amphibian, crustacean), or else on human health were catastrophic. However, almost nothing is known concerning the consequences of biological invasions of native microbial communities by ice-released microbes. Thus, microcosm and mesocosm experiments—designed to mimic the natural conditions these microbes will encounter once liberated from their confinement—are crucial to characterize the infectivity and virulence of these extremotolerant microbes, as well as their potential to act as donors of genetic elements. Looking for past events of HGT by means of bioinformatics can also bring some important clues to understand genetic exchanges within natural communities colonizing glacial ice, as already suggested by Klassen and Foght (
