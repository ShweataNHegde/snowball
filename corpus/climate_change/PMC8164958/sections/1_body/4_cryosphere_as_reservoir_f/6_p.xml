<p id="Par20">Even though their viability is highly variable, other eukaryotic microorganisms have also been detected in ancient ice and resurrected with relative ease. For instance, in 2005 a group of Russian researchers found viable protozoa (including amoeboids, ciliates and flagellates) in permafrost samples collected from the Eastern sector of the Arctic tundra, with an estimated age ranging between 28,000 and 35,000 years old (Shatilovich et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2005</xref>). Since then, many more protozoa have been discovered in permanently frozen environments and further reactivated. These studies confirmed that microbes may survive for long periods of time (sometimes, up to one million years) at subzero temperatures, and in the absence of any oxygen and liquid water (Shatilovich et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2020</xref>). Following a different approach, García-Descalzo et al. (
