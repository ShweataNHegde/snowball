<p id="Par16">For instance, 
 <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> yeasts and bacterial coliforms have been detected in ice cores or meltwater runoff in different regions (Goodwin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2012</xref>; Turchetti et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">2015</xref>). Also, emerging pathogens like 
 <italic>Aureobasidium melanogenum</italic>, 
 <italic>Naganishisa albida</italic>, and 
 <italic>Rhodotorula mucilaginosa</italic>, have been isolated from Arctic environments in Greenland and Svalbard (Perini et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2019</xref>). The yeasts exhibited several virulence-associated traits such as hemolytic ability, growth at 37 °C, resistance to antifungal agents, and production of siderophores. Recently, Mogrovejo-Arias et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2020</xref>) demonstrated the presence of hemolytic bacteria, potentially pathogenic, in environmental samples (including glacial meltwater) collected in the Svalbard archipelago, in the Norwegian Arctic. Further, a Brazilian group have also detected drug-resistant fungi, in Antarctic samples of rocks, soils, and seawater (Alves et al.
