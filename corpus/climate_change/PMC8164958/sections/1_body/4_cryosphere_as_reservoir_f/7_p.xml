<p id="Par21">Some of these amoeboids have been shown to be infected by giant double-stranded DNA viruses, identified as members of previously unknown families (Legendre et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2014</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2015</xref>) and potentially infectious to humans and animals (Tokarz-Deptula et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2019</xref>). Incidentally, as strange as it may seem, nematodes are also able to survive for thousand years in anabiosis, and have been resurrected from ancient glacier ice (Shatilovich et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2018</xref>).
