<p id="Par17">All of these pathogens are closely related to modern microbial strains. However, several studies also report on the presence of potentially pathogenic microorganisms in very old ice samples. While in many cases these ancient microbes have been detected only by microscopy (either optical or electronic) or by molecular methods, many other have been reactivated (“resurrected”) by culturing them in the laboratory under controlled conditions. In the case of bacteria, the ability to sporulate can account for this long-term persistence in a dormant state; this is also the case of cyst-forming protozoa or spore-forming fungi.</p>
