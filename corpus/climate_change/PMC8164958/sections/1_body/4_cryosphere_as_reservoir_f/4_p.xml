<p id="Par18">The existence of viable microbes in ancient ice is far from new. In 1982, a Russian group led by Sabit S. Abyzov reported the finding of numerous and highly-diverse viable bacteria in ancient ice cores collected from several kilometers deep above Lake Vostok (the largest subglacial lake in Antarctica) (Abyzov et al.

In 2013, Knowlton and his collaborators used culture-dependent and molecular methods (such as metagenomics and metatranscriptomics) to detect the presence of bacteria and fungi in Greenland’s and Antarctica’s glacial ice cores, ranging from 500 to 157,000 years old (Knowlton et al.
