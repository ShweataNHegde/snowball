 <italic>Cryptococcus deuterogattii</italic>, previously named 
 <italic>Cryptococcus gattii</italic> VGII, was recently elevated to a species within the 
 <italic>Cryptococcus gattii</italic> species complex [
 <xref rid="ppat.1009503.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>gattii</italic> complex species were traditionally associated with tropical and subtropical climates [
 <xref rid="ppat.1009503.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]; however, in recent years, 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>deuterogattii</italic> has emerged in the temperate regions of western Canada and the Pacific northwest of North America where it caused hundreds of infections in people and animals [
 <xref rid="ppat.1009503.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Interestingly, 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>deuterogattii</italic> has a higher level of thermal tolerance than other 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>gattii</italic> complex members, indicating that it may have a greater capacity for thermal adaptation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1009503.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The spread of this fungus has been attributed to anthropogenic dispersal through vehicle wheel wells, footwear, construction and forestry activity (leading to aerial dispersal), and water [
 <xref rid="ppat.1009503.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], with climate change suggested as a potential driver [
