 <italic>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</italic> (
 <italic>Bd</italic>) is an emerging pathogen of amphibians. An environmental chitrid fungus, 
 <italic>Bd</italic> is responsible for the most spectacular loss of amphibian diversity in history [
 <xref rid="ppat.1009503.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and since 1998 has spread to all continents where amphibians are found, decimating populations in Australia and North and South America [
 <xref rid="ppat.1009503.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. 
 <italic>Bd</italic> has also spread to Africa, with the first report in North Africa in 2011 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1009503.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. IPCC data forecasts an increased spread of 
 <italic>Bd</italic> across the northern hemisphere, particularly in the higher-latitude regions that are experiencing warming temperatures [
 <xref rid="ppat.1009503.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition to the increased global range of the pathogen, a shift from cold to hotter temperature has been shown to increase the susceptibility of the amphibian host [
 <xref rid="ppat.1009503.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Increasing climate change is therefore predicted to cause an ongoing decline in amphibian populations.
