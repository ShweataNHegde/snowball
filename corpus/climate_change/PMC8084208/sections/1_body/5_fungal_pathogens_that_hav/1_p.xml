<p>Climate change affects rainfall causing floods and drought and can increase tropical cyclone and tornado severity, leading to far-reaching human health impacts. The link between natural disasters and subsequent fungal infections in disaster-affected persons is increasingly recognized, with an excellent review of this area by Benedict and Park [
 <xref rid="ppat.1009503.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Disaster-associated fungi can be violently displaced and widely disseminated, leading to pulmonary and soft tissue infections by fungal species that may otherwise be uncommon. For example, a severe duststorm in the southern San Joaquin Valley of California in 1977 dispersed 
 <italic>Coccidioides immitis</italic> from Bakersfield, an area of high endemnicity, to Sacremento County, where it is rare, resulting in more than 100 infections [
 <xref rid="ppat.1009503.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. While this predates the era of significant climate change, it demonstrates the ramifications of acute environmental disruption, particularly as climate change modelling predicts that the range of 
 <italic>Coccidioides</italic> could expand from 12 to 17 states, with infections increasing by 50% [

 <italic>Apophysomyces trapeziformis</italic>, a thermotolerant saprotroph that is an extremely rare cause of mucormycosis caused a cluster of cases in patients wounded following the 2011 tornado in Joplin, Missouri [
 <xref rid="ppat.1009503.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Various other soil-borne fungal pathogens have been speculated to have increased in frequency or range due to climate-induced disruptions, including 
 <italic>Talaromyces marneffei</italic> [
 <xref rid="ppat.1009503.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], 
 <italic>Blastomyces</italic>, 
 <italic>Histoplasma</italic> [
 <xref rid="ppat.1009503.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and 
 <italic>Paracoccidioides</italic> [
 <xref rid="ppat.1009503.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Outside of their normal range, these fungal infections can be challenging to diagnose and they are often refractory to treatment, frequently resulting in poor patient outcomes [
