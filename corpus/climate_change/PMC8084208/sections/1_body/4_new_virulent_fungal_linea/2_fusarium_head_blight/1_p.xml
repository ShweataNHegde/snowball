 <italic>Fusarium</italic> head blight (FHB) is a disease of great concern for wheat and for other cereal crops [
 <xref rid="ppat.1009503.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Caused by members of the 
 <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> species complex (FGSC) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1009503.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], infection leads to reduced cereal yield and quality, thereby negatively affecting food security. Outbreaks occur particularly in years with warm and humid weather conditions, resulting in yield losses of up to 75% [
 <xref rid="ppat.1009503.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Over the past approximately 20 years, some temperate regions have seen a shift from 
 <italic>Fusarium culmorum</italic>, which is associated with cooler and wetter conditions, to 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>graminearum</italic>, which favours warmer, humid conditions [
