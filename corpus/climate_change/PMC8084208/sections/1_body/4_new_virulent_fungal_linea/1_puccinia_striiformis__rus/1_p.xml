<p>Stripe rust is one of the most devastating global diseases of wheat and is caused by the fungus 
 <italic>Puccinia striiformis</italic> [
 <xref rid="ppat.1009503.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1009503.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Wheat yellow (stripe) rust, caused by 
 <italic>Puccinia striiformis f</italic>. sp. 
 <italic>tritici</italic> (
 <italic>Pst</italic>), has previously shown preference for cold areas but has recently been seen to invade warmer regions [
 <xref rid="ppat.1009503.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Since 2000, 
 <italic>Pst</italic> has been reported to have adapted to increased temperatures, with novel strains Pst1, Pst2, and “Warrier,” which are more aggressive and thermotolerant, replacing older strains and spreading to new regions [
 <xref rid="ppat.1009503.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. These strains have now been reported worldwide [
 <xref rid="ppat.1009503.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], with major outbreaks occuring in south central United States [
 <xref rid="ppat.1009503.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1009503.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and Australia [
 <xref rid="ppat.1009503.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Microsatellite genotyping and virulence phenotyping have detected a high degree of variability within the Pst1 and Pst2 lineages, demonstrating an ongoing evolutionary potential of this pathogen [
