<p>Climate change produces a confluence of factors that can act together to drive the emergence of new pathogens (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009503.g001">Fig 1</xref>). In the clinical setting, it may become increasingly necessary to consider infection by novel or uncommon species, or adapted strains within species, which might otherwise be considered unlikely to be endemic or capable of breaching the mammalian thermal barrier. The era of HIV-AIDS and immunosuppression rewrote the textbooks on medical mycology and what may or may not be considered a potential fungal pathogen; it is likely that climate change will do this again.
