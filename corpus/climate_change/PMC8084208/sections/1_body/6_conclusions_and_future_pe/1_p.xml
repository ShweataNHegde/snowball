<p>Unless action is taken to drastically reduce carbon emissions, the global temperature will continue to rise, and the impacts of climate change are predicted to become increasingly severe. Fungi are likely to continue to affect crops and native plants, with expanding ecological range and long-distance dispersal events producing new risks. The threat of novel fungal infections of humans and other mammals is less predictable, and there is a need to understand more about the nexus between ecology and medical mycology, which have traditionally been studied in relative isolation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1009503.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. It is now recognised that many clinically relevant fungal pathogens, including those traditionally considered to be human commensals like 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, can be found in the environment [
 <xref rid="ppat.1009503.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], with environmental pressures affecting the evolution of novel traits including virulence and antifungal resistance [
