However, some of the negative effects of heat stress observed in a controlled study appeared to be mitigated by prophylactic yeast and yeast cell wall supplementation in nearly finished beef cattle. Heifers supplemented with a combined live yeast and yeast cell wall product had decreased vaginal temperature and respiration rate and increased water intake in comparison to non-supplemented control heifers (
