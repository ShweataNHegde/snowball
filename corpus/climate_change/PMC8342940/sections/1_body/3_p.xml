<p>Heat abatement by physical modification of the environment is an effective and profitable strategy to manage heat stress in dairy cattle leading to successful outcomes that minimize the negative impacts of heat stress on animal health. Although heat abatement for mature dairy cows, especially those housed in barns, has been extensively studied, additional effort is needed to develop effective and affordable cooling strategies for grazing dairy cattle, preweaned calves, and growing heifers to maintain immune function and optimal performance of these animals under field conditions.</p>
