<p>Alterations in immune responses are observed in many species under heat stress; in broiler chickens, a particular sensitivity of lymphoid tissues to heat stress has been observed, with a depression of antigen-specific humoral immune responses, a substantial decrease in the number of splenic lymphocytes, and a decrease in immature B cells in bursal follicles.

As a matter of fact, the maintenance of tissue-specific homeostasis requires sufficient amounts of nutrients (e.g., glucose, fatty acids, amino acids, minerals, and vitamins) to meet the specific tissue requirements. The insufficient nutritive supply to primary and secondary lymphoid tissue induced by heat stress may cause pathological atrophy of tissues, reducing lymphocyte number and degrading functional structures.
