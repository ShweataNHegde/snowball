<p>Livestock production and welfare currently face critical challenges from climate change and global warming that will continue in the future with the predicted increase in the frequency and intensity of heat waves.

Climate change contributes to the impairment of animal welfare and health both by the spread of vector-borne diseases and by its impact on the immune system of the animals, inducing immune suppression and increasing the susceptibility of animals to infections. In livestock, high-yielding animals, characterized by an accelerated metabolism and genetic selection based on production level in near-optimal conditions, may be the most endangered by climate change and the least resilient (
