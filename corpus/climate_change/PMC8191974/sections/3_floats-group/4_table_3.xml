      <break/>✓ Included additional images to accompany the text
      <break/>✓ Added more information on Lyme disease symptoms and illness representation

     <td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">✓ Added more of the messengers that participants found most engaging (e.g. person with lived experience and medical doctor)
      <break/>✓ Added specific visuals that participants requested (e.g. comparisons of different tick species, pets, and tick habitat)
     </td>
     <td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">✓ Changed the colour ramps to use less red and make the colours less bright
      <break/>✓ Eliminated technical terminology and simplified the language in the map caption and legend
      <break/>✓ Changed the language around the time periods shown and removed the 2015 Lyme disease risk areas
      <break/>✓ Added a map to visualize a lower carbon pathway (RCP 4.5) to show how climate action could lessen the spread of Lyme disease

     <td align="left" colspan="3" rowspan="1">• Creative, visual mediums of communication are most effective, but diversity is important. Incorporating elements of storytelling and relatable visuals into communication products are most effective at engaging people.
      <break/>• Climate communicators should explore how to better integrate content into platforms and contexts that are already relevant to audiences (e.g. share information through outdoor magazines, parks, hunting and fishing guides, TV commercials, doctors’ offices, etc.).
      <break/>• Climate communicators should be reflective of when and how maps of climate projections are and are not useful for communicating to lay audiences versus professional users. There is a need for further user testing of maps and other climate visuals created for CIWs.
