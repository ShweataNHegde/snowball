<p>Over the past two decades, Lyme disease has emerged in Manitoba as the blacklegged tick (

 <xref rid="pone.0252952.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In this way climate change is expected to increase the risk of Lyme disease in endemic areas, as well as well as bring the risk to new areas. Illness representation of Lyme disease can vary widely between individuals; common symptoms may include a circular “bulls-eye” rash around the bite area and flu-like symptoms, such as fatigue, fever, headache, and hot and cold sweats, while in the minority of cases the disease can cause serious neurological effects. In addition to the provincial and federal Lyme disease surveillance efforts to track the disease spread [
