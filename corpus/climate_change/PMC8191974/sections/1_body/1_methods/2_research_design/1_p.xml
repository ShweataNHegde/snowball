<p>A qualitative design based on the focus group method [
 <xref rid="pone.0252952.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] was used to explore responses to visual and written communication materials about Lyme disease and climate change. These focus groups were divided in two parts, with the first exploring baseline public perceptions of climate change and Lyme disease, and the second exploring responses to communication materials. The present article focuses on findings from the second part of the focus groups (i.e. materials testing); results from the first part as well as a detailed description of the method are shared elsewhere [
