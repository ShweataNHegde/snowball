<p>Participants were divided into focus groups according to level of concern about climate change as indicated in the pre-screening questionnaire, with one “high” climate concern and one “low” climate concern group per community (

 <xref rid="pone.0252952.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>)). Discussions were structured in two parts: (1) to explore participants’ perceptions of each of the three communications materials (video, map, and article); and (2) to allow for comparison of the materials. In the first part, the facilitator presented one material at a time and allowed participants to become familiar with it. Afterwards, the facilitator prompted participants to discuss their impressions of this first material (e.g. 
 <italic toggle="yes">“What’s the key message of this material</italic>?
 <italic toggle="yes">”</italic>, 
 <italic toggle="yes">“What did you like or dislike about it</italic>?
 <italic toggle="yes">”</italic>). They proceeded in the same way for the two other materials. The materials were presented in randomized order across focus groups. For the second part of the discussion, the facilitator prompted participants to discuss the comparison of all three materials (e.g. 
 <italic toggle="yes">“Which material was the most and least effective</italic>?
 <italic toggle="yes">”</italic>, 
 <italic toggle="yes">“How does the focus of all materials compare</italic>?
 <italic toggle="yes">”</italic>).
