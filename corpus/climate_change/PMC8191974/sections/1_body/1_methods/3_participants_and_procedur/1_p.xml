<p>This research received ethics approval from the University of Winnipeg Human Research Ethics Board. Two focus groups were held in each of the three communities over November and December 2019, for a total of six focus groups with 61 participants. The research team collaborated with Probe Research, an independent third-party research firm who assisted with recruitment and discussion moderation. Because the focus groups were specifically testing materials developed by the research team, it was preferable to have an independent moderator to avoid any potential bias. Participants of a range of demographics and concern about climate change were recruited at random from Probe Researchâ€™s panel of over 6,000 people in Manitoba. During recruitment, a short screening questionnaire was conducted by phone which asked: age, climate concern, gender, city or town of residence, ethnicity, education, occupation, and time spent working outdoors. People who had participated in a focus group at any point in the past year, or who worked for media, advertising, in the field of climate science, or at the University of the researchers, were excluded.</p>
