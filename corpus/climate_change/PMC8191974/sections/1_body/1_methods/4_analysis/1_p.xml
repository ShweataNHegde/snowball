<p>We conducted qualitative thematic analyses on the discussion transcripts in a qualitative analysis software (NVivo 11.4). The coding procedure was developed jointly by the four authors and two researchers independently coded all the data, with a third researcher being consulted in case of disagreements. First, we organised the segments into categories according to if they discussed a) the article, b) video, c) map, or d) the comparison of materials. Second, we identified themes describing participants’ responses to each material separately. We coded themes describing participants’ initial reactions to materials (e.g. confusion, skepticism, interest), attitude and behaviour change, and their perceptions of the key message of the material. These themes were compared across all three materials to identify similarities and differences in responses across the materials. Third, we coded the segments in which participants were explicitly asked to compare the materials, by identifying key themes emerging from the discussions. To guide our identification and interpretation of key themes, we calculated frequency counts of each theme and compared them across materials and across levels of concern for climate change (high vs. low concern, as indicated on the pre-screening questionnaire).</p>
