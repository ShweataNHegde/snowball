<p>This research is among the first to test audience responses to climate change visualizations in Manitoba, and more research is needed to further test tools such as these from this and other CIWs. It illustrates the importance of user-driven, evidence-based approaches to climate change communication and associated development of CIWs, with a strong, continuous feedback cycle between developers/users and theory/practice. This paper demonstrates that a continuum of climate communication materials–from video, text to maps–may increase salience and emotional response with each subsequent intervention. Indeed, it is paramount that climate communicators evaluate, interrogate, and revise their approaches and tools to ensure information is appropriate for different audiences and their concomitant worldviews. By taking this type of evidence-based approach, climate communicators and CIW developers will ideally increase both climate knowledge and action across various audiences within society.</p>
