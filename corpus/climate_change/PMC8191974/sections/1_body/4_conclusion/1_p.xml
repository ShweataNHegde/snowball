<p>The intersecting crises of climate change and public health demand communication approaches that bolster public engagement in these issues for urgent and far-reaching action. The findings from this focus group study in central Canada shed light on benefits, challenges, and considerations in communicating about the relationship between climate change and climate-affected Lyme disease, with implications for the use of different mediums and frames within climate communications. The results illustrate the efficacy of the use of video as a climate visual, while another visual material, a series of climate maps, was less effective and less understood across audiences. It was clear that the video successfully translated scientific information through narrative elements, visual storytelling, and relatable messengers, while the climate maps required prior audience knowledge and ability to engage with more complex scientific information. Based on the results here, we suggest video, and to a lesser extent plain language articles, may be better mediums of communication for audiences with lower levels of knowledge or concern on climate change, which may prime these individuals and communities for subsequently interpreting more complex materials such as climate projection maps.</p>
