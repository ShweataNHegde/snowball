<p>The present study explores the use of visuals and health framing in climate change communication, by testing audience responses to various communication materials on climate change and the climate-affected infectious disease Lyme disease. Communication materials were created by a university-based research team responsible for a Canadian CIW–the

 <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.climateatlas.ca/" ext-link-type="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.climateatlas.ca</ext-link>)–to enable testing of various frames and mediums employed in climate communications. Focus groups were conducted in southern Manitoba, an area of recent establishment of Lyme disease, to test public understanding and perception of communication materials. This research offers insights for improving evidenced-based approaches to developing materials on CIWs as well as communications at the nexus of climate and health impacts more broadly.
