<p>People from high and low climate concern groups suggested either separating the Lyme disease and climate change messages, or prioritizing one so that there is a clear focus. Multiple people said that if Lyme disease is the focus, then climate change should be excluded or minimized in the materials so as not to lose interest from climate skeptical audiences. A participant from one of the high climate concern groups explained: “I think most of us here agree with climate change, [but] a lot of people out there don’t, so as soon as you try to frame this as ‘you better be scared of climate change because of ticks’ you’re going to have people ignore your information on ticks.” Others noted that if climate change is the main focus, then the materials should focus on other impacts because “there’s bigger issues than…ticks with climate change”. A few people argued that it is important to discuss both Lyme disease and climate change together to give context to why the ticks are spreading and increase awareness of climate impacts. As one person expressed, “I think it’s helpful that the climate change part of it is in there…it helps us understand why it’s increasing or where it’s coming from.”</p>
