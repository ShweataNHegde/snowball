<p>Many participants across groups reported enjoying the video and finding it engaging. A key message identified was that blacklegged ticks and Lyme disease are not abating and thus people must learn to adapt and take preventative measures. Other key information reported was how Lyme disease is spreading, how ticks survive in warmer weather, and the increasing risk in Manitoba. As one Winnipeg participant described their key takeaway: “Lyme disease is growing a lot faster than I thought. It’s going to become more and more of a threat.” People found the visuals particularly helpful, such as the images of the bullseye rash common after a tick bite, the blacklegged ticks themselves, and researchers sampling for ticks in suitable habitat. People in several groups also commented that they liked the story element; as one Brandon participant described, “It was good how they went from… a personal story and then kind of backing it up with some of the research.” The preferred messengers from the video were the community member who had contracted Lyme disease, the medical doctor who actively sees Lyme patients, and the field researcher who sampled ticks, as opposed to the scientists in labs and offices.</p>
