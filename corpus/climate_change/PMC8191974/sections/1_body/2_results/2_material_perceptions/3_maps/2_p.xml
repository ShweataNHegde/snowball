<p>There were many criticisms of the maps, with people in every group saying that the language used in the map caption was too complex and technical for an average person. Participants expressed not understanding climate models and projections, degree days, high carbon emissions scenarios (RCP 8.5), and down-scaled climate data. Another point of confusion was the timeframes of the past, near future, and far future used on the maps; many people in five of the groups wanted to see the present represented (i.e. 2019). People in two of the groups mentioned that the map of the far future (2051–2080) had no effect on them because it was not relatable. One person mentioned, “…by 2080, I’m sorry, I’m not going to be around. How can I relate to that last picture?” Additionally, some people in three of the groups took issue with the use of climate projections, suggesting that they are not accurate or reliable. One person described scientific projections as “guessing”. As another person mentioned, “Well…it’s such a huge timeframe and as I said, you look at the history of forecasting weather… they’re accurate to a degree, but never exact. And so, I look at this and okay, well, yes, they are true to a degree, but how accurate?” A few people across two of the groups simply did not understand the map at all, with one stating “It’s a pretty picture. It looks like it’s getting worse, but we don’t understand why.”</p>
