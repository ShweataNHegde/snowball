<p>Across all three low climate change concern groups, there were many people in each group who remained skeptical of the link between climate change and Lyme disease after reading the article. Many said that the article did not show proof that the rise in Lyme disease is related to climate change, while others said they simply “don’t buy it”. In one low climate concern group, someone declared that the article was “propaganda,” and in another someone noticed that amongst the peer-reviewed literature there were also news articles and grey literature cited, and said that the article was not credible because of its sources. Among those in the high climate concern groups, some people wanted more information on the implications of the connection between action on climate change and Lyme disease. As one participant in Winnipeg stated: “Do you think reducing emissions–which I agree is needed and a must–do you think it’s going to change anything about Lyme disease? Even if we stop producing any emissions tomorrow, [the ticks] are here.”</p>
