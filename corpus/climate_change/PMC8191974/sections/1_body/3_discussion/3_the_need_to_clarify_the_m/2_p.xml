<p>The results here suggest that marrying public health and climate change information is not as straightforward as it may seem, as the association of the two topics may draw skepticism from those already unconvinced or skeptical of climate change. In this context, it seems that “strategically decoupling” the two issues in communications might be more effective in some cases, especially if the primary goal is to motivate adaptive health behaviours among skeptical or mixed opinion audiences [

However, if the goal is to increase awareness regarding the human dimensions of climate change, reframing climate change from an environmental to a human health issue is essential. At present, there is a need to critically evaluate what a health frame in climate communications looks like, and these results suggest a broader approach that has the widest connection to the health of the target audience is likely most effective (i.e. a focus on Lyme disease alone was not convincing for many). In this regard, health officials and climate communicators may approach and present the content differently–by separating or connecting climate and health risks–according to their respective goals and audiences (
