<p>Most participants expressed a preference for the video, as it related visuals and stories. This finding aligns with previous research which suggests that visuals can make climate change impacts more concrete, relatable, and engaging (e.g. [

 <xref rid="pone.0252952.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]) and further suggests that video in particular can change public attitudes on climate change (e.g. [

 <xref rid="pone.0252952.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], the medium of video can allow both impact and action-oriented visuals to be woven together to produce a message that provides a balance of hope and urgency to motivate viewers. Similarly, some have argued that effective climate imagery should capture the depth and complexity of both the problem and its solutions to engage a wide audience [

 <xref rid="pone.0252952.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The results here suggest that both visuals of the problem (e.g. animated map of disease spread) and the solution (e.g. scientists conducting field surveillance) resonated with participants.
