<p>The final key finding shows that materials were interpreted differently by participants based on their previously-held beliefs and cultural values, and that self-reported attitude and behaviour change was limited. These results are consistent with previous research [

 <xref rid="pone.0252952.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and may be explained by the high social costs and barriers of updating and changing one’s beliefs [

Specifically, those already skeptical of climate change often expressed skepticism about the communication materials and brought up other factors that are affecting the spread of ticks, or shifted the conversation to an unrelated topic. Yet, many of the participants who believed in the risks were not willing to change their behaviour. Most participants said they would not take extra precautions to prevent tick bites after seeing the materials, either because they do not perceive the risk as great enough or because they already enact these behaviours. Aenishaenslin et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0252952.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] found similar results in a national survey following a Lyme disease communication campaign by the Government of Canada, showing high awareness of Lyme disease but low rates of adopting preventative behaviours. Indication of participants adopting behaviours to mitigate climate change after seeing the materials was even lower, indeed, no participants said they would change their behaviours to act on climate change. The shift from attitudinal change to behavioural change is a well-known challenge in psychological research, and communication materials must stimulate deeper engagement with the issue, particularly through an emotional connection, which seemed to best demonstrated through the use of video in our study.
