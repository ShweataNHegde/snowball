<p>Temperature is considered one of the most important factors affecting the distribution and abundance patterns of plants due to the physiological limits of each species [
 <xref rid="B19-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It is a factor that limits the geographical areas where different crops can be grown, as well as a factor that affects the rate of development, growth and crop yields [
 <xref rid="B20-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Agricultural crops have basic temperature requirements to complete a particular phenophase as well as the entire life cycle. In addition, extremely low and high temperatures can have detrimental effects on crop development, growth, and yield, especially during critical phenophases (such as anthesis) [
 <xref rid="B21-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It is predicted that the springâ€“summer season will have higher air temperatures, which would be beneficial for crop production in northern locations where the length of the growing season is currently a limiting factor [
 <xref rid="B22-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The effects of temperature increase are generally associated with other environmental factors such as water availability, the occurrence of strong winds, and the intensity and duration of sunlight [
 <xref rid="B20-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The direct negative temperature influence on yield could be additionally impacted by indirect temperature influences on these environmental factors. For example, the rise in temperature increases atmospheric water demand, which may lead to additional water stress due to higher water pressure deficits, which subsequently reduces soil moisture and eventually decreases yield [
