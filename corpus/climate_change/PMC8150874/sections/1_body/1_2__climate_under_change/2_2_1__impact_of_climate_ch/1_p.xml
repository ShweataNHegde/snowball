<p>Agriculture, often referred to as an open-air factory, is an economic activity that depends heavily on climate and certain weather conditions to produce food and many other goods necessary to sustain human needs. Moreover, agriculture is an activity that is exceptionally vulnerable to climate change and the impacts of climate change are characterized by various types of uncertainty [
