<p>The extent of the responses of most native and non-native insect species to global warming is still unknown, and certainly the new warmer conditions would not be beneficial to all of them [

 <xref rid="B134-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. Once a new species arrives in a new habitat, the other stages of the invasion process could be positively or negatively influenced by existing climate and climate change [
 <xref rid="B142-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. Climate change can directly affect the transport and introduction of invasive insects. Extreme climate events (e.g., storms, high winds, hurricanes, currents, and swells) could shift pests to new geographic areas where they may find environmental conditions favourable for establishment [

 <italic>Cactoblastis cactorum</italic> Berg), was blown from the Caribbean islands to Mexico during the 2005 hurricane season, where it posed a significant ecological and economic threat to more than 104 prickly pear species (
