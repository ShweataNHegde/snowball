<p>Invasive species usually have a wider range of tolerance or bioclimatic range than native insects, allowing alien insects to find a wider range of suitable habitats [

Because plasticity is a trait of the individual, it is often touted as a responsive mechanism that allows organisms to adapt to new environmental conditions in the rapidly changing world (also referred to as “plastic rescue”) [
