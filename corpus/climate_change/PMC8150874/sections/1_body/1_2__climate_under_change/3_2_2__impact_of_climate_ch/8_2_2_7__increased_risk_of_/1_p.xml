<p>Invasive alien species (IAS) are defined as taxa that are introduced either intentionally (e.g., food, crops, ornamentals, pets, livestock) or unintentionally due to human activities outside their natural habitat [

 <xref rid="B133-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. The spread of species to regions outside their original range has accelerated exponentially over the last millennium due to international travel, the global trading system and agriculture [

 <xref rid="B135-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>] describes invasive alien species as the greatest threat to global biodiversity with high costs to agriculture, forestry and aquatic ecosystems [
 <xref rid="B6-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It is commonly assumed that only a small proportion of introduced IAS become established and only a small proportion of these species spread and become economic pests. This is often referred to as the “rule of 10,” according to which approximately 1 in 10 introduced species escape into the environment, 1 in 10 of these introduced species become established in the environment, and 1 in 10 of these established species become economic pests [
