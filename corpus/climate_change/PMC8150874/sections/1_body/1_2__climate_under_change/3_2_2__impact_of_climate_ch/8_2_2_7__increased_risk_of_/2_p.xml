<p>For invasive insect pest species, many authors in recent studies predict expanded geographic range and increased population densities and voltinism under predicted climate change scenarios [

To become invasive, alien insects must successfully arrive in a new habitat, survive the given conditions, and thrive. Climate change could positively or negatively influence the components of this invasive pathway. Climate, in combination with landscape features, sets the limits for the dispersal of such species and determines the seasonal conditions for their development, growth and survival in a new habitat [

 <xref rid="B141-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. All biological systems have thermal limits, so temperature increase will have a huge impact on ecosystems and the species that live in them.
