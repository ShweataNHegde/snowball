<p>Adaptations can take the form of phenotypic, behavioural, developmental, or physiological traits. Physiological or behavioural plasticity may result from differences in environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, photoperiod), available diet, or pressure from predators or competitors [

 <xref rid="B156-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. Behavioural responses can be adaptive and improve fitness, such as finding host plant species when invading new environments. One of the plastic responses of foraging insects to new environments is to change or expand their food choices. For some species, such as 
 <italic>D. suzukii</italic>, which shows extreme plasticity in its diet choice with more than 30 plant species, diet breath is probably the most important trait responsible for its invasion success [

 <xref rid="B153-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. Snell-Rood et al. [
 <xref rid="B153-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>] predict that general mechanisms that evolve through selective processes within an individual are very likely to lead to survival in new environments, especially when conditions exceed the typical range of the native environment in extreme ways, such as large temperature shifts. In ectotherms such as insects, thermal adaptation may occur, for example, through behavioural traits that control energy metabolism [
