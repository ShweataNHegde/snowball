<p>As mentioned earlier, temperature is the most important environmental factor for insects, affecting mainly their phenology. The ambient energy hypothesis suggests that growth and reproduction are greater at high temperatures. Therefore, higher temperatures or global warming leads to higher population sizes, which in turn can lead to a higher number of species in dynamic equilibrium [

 <xref rid="B120-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. Under a global warming scenario this makes it possible to accelerate reproductive rates within a certain preferred range, leading to an increase in the number of generations of many insect species and to more crop damage [
