<p>As mentioned in the previous section, increased CO
 <sub>2</sub> levels are likely to affect plant physiology by increasing photosynthetic activity, resulting in better growth and higher plant productivity. This in turn would indirectly affect insects by changing both the quantity and quality of plants and vegetation. A common feature of plants grown under elevated CO
 <sub>2</sub> is a change in the chemical composition of leaves, which could affect the nutrient quality of foliage and palatability to leaf-feeding insects [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00440-f002">Figure 2</xref>). In addition, such crops often accumulate sugars and starches in their leaves, which reduces palatability by altering the C (carbon) to N (nitrogen) ratio [
 <xref rid="B65-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Nitrogen is the key element in the insectâ€™s body for its development, and therefore increased CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration leads to increased plant consumption rate in some pest groups [
 <xref rid="B66-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. This can lead to increased levels of plant damage, as pests must consume more plant tissue to obtain an equivalent level of food. Increased consumption rates are a common response in foliage feeders, such as caterpillars, miners, and chewers, to a reduction in nitrogen, as predicted by CO
 <sub>2</sub> fertilization, with compensatory feeding [

 <xref rid="B67-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] conducted an experiment in which soybeans were grown at elevated atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentrations. During the early season, soybeans exhibited 57% more damage from insects such as the Japanese beetle (

 <italic>Empoasca fabae</italic> Harris), Mexican bean beetle (
 <italic>Epilachna varivestis</italic> Mulsant), and Western corn rootworm (
 <italic>Diabrotica virgifera virgifera</italic> Le Conte) than soybean grown under ambient atmospheric conditions. This study concluded that the measured increase in simple sugars content in soybean foliage may have stimulated compensatory insect feeding [
 <xref rid="B67-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Under these conditions, insect herbivores tend to consume more plant material and thereat cause more plant damage [

 <xref rid="B69-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Increased feeding rates do not always compensate for reduced diet quality, and consumption of plants growing under elevated CO
 <sub>2</sub> conditions could reduce the efficiency of the arthropods that feed on them [
 <xref rid="B70-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Responses to CO
 <sub>2</sub> fertilization vary depending on the type of pest feeding. Whole-cell feeders such as thrips show an increase in population size [
 <xref rid="B66-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Phloem-feeding insect pests, including whiteflies and aphids, have combined responses of increased population growth rates and a decrease in population density [
 <xref rid="B71-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. There are inconsistent reports on the effects of elevated CO
 <sub>2</sub> on sucking insects, although in some cases abundance and fecundity may increase [
 <xref rid="B60-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Stiling and Cornelissen [
 <xref rid="B72-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] conducted a meta-analytic study and reviewed study documentation on the indirect effects of a CO
 <sub>2</sub> increase on life history parameters of herbivores. The results of their study showed strong responses of insect pests to increased CO
 <sub>2</sub> compared to ambient CO
 <sub>2</sub>; (I) an increase in consumption rates of about 17%; (II) a decrease in pest abundance of about 22%; (III) an increase in development time of about 4%; and (IV) a decrease in relative growth rate of about 9% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00440-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Stronger effects of the increase in atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub> were also found for chewers in contrast to other feeding guilds, such as sap-sucking herbivores (e.g., aphids, leafhoppers, scale insects). Thus, it has been shown that despite the numerous studies conducted to assess aphid responses to elevated atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub> levels, it is still not possible to predict future response in general or to establish general rules for different aphid populations to changes in climate [
