<p>Elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub> can affect the distribution, abundance, and performance of herbivorous insects. Such increases can affect consumption rates, growth rates, fecundity, and population densities of insect pests [
 <xref rid="B61-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Currently available data suggest that the effect of elevated atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub> on herbivory is not only highly specific to individual insect species, but also to particular insect pestâ€“host plant systems [
 <xref rid="B62-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The effects of increasing CO
 <sub>2</sub> levels on insect pests are highly dependent on their host plants. Increased CO
 <sub>2</sub> levels would have a greater impact on C3 crops (wheat, rice, cotton, etc.) than on C4 crops (corn, sorghum, etc.). Therefore, these differential effects of elevated atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub> on C3 and C4 plants may result in asymmetric effects on herbivory, and the response of insects feeding on C4 plants may differ from that of C3 plants. C3 plants are likely to be positively affected by elevated CO
 <sub>2</sub> and negatively affected by insect response, whereas C4 plants are less responsive to elevated CO
 <sub>2</sub> and therefore less likely to be affected by changes in insect feeding behavior [
