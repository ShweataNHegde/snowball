<p>Insect physiology is very sensitive to changes in temperature, and their metabolic rate tends to approximately double with an increase of 10 °C [
 <xref rid="B48-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In this context, many researchers have shown that increased temperature tends to accelerate insect consumption, development, and movement, which can affect population dynamics by influencing fecundity, survival, generation time, population size, and geographic range [
 <xref rid="B49-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Species that cannot adapt and evolve to increased temperature conditions generally have a difficult time maintaining their populations, while other species can thrive and reproduce rapidly. Temperature plays an important role in metabolism, metamorphosis, mobility, and host availability, which determines the possibility of changes in pest population and dynamics [

 <xref rid="B50-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Given the distribution and behaviour of insect pests, it can be hypothesised that an increase in temperature should be associated with increased herbivory [
 <xref rid="B50-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], as well as changes in the growth rate of insect populations [
 <xref rid="B51-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Thus, insect populations in tropical zones are predicted to experience a decrease in growth rate as a result of climate warming due to the current temperature level, which is already close to the optimum for pest development and growth, while insects in temperate zones are expected to experience an increase in growth rate [
 <xref rid="B51-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The same authors confirmed this theory by estimating changes in the growth of pest populations in the production of the world’s three major grain crops (wheat, rice and maize) under different climate change scenarios. According to the study, for wheat, which is normally grown in temperate climates, warming will accelerate the growth of pest populations. For rice grown in tropical zones, they predict a decrease in the growth of pest populations, and for maize grown in both temperate and tropical regions, mixed responses to the growth of pest populations could be expected [
