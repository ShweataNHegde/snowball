<p>Another study of about 1100 insect species found that climate change due to global warming will drive about 15â€“37% of these species to extinction by 2050 [

 <xref rid="B60-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].The general consequences of global warming on insect dynamics include: expansion of geographic range, increased survival rates of overwintering populations, increased risk of introduction of invasive insect species, increased incidence of insect-transmitted plant diseases due to range expansion and rapid reproduction of insect vectors, reduced effectiveness of biological control agents such as natural enemies, etc.
