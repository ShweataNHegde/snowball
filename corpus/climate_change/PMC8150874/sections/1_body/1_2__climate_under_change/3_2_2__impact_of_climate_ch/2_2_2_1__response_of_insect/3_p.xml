<p>Future changes in insect population dynamics depend on the level of global temperature increase in coming years. Climate models predict that the average temperature of the globe will increase by 1.8–4 °C by the end of the current century [

 <xref rid="B56-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. As ambient temperatures generally increase toward optimal temperatures for growth and development of many insect pest species, potentially reducing thermal constraints on population dynamics, the severity of pest infestations is expected to increase under global warming scenarios [
 <xref rid="B57-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. However, given the narrow ecological niche requirements, physiological tolerances of insects, and variable effects of temperature on their phenology and life history, global warming may not uniformly increase pest abundance and thus economic crop losses [
 <xref rid="B58-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In their analysis, Lehmann et al. [
 <xref rid="B58-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] showed mixed responses to climate warming in different insect pest species. The results of their analysis indicate that temperature rise leads to increased pest severity in most of their insect case studies. However, 59% of all species analysed showed responses that could reduce their harmful impact, mostly via reduced physiological performance and range contraction.
