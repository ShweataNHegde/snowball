<p>Crop distribution ranges are predicted to shift due to climate change. As an outcome, herbivores may track changes in crop distribution and migrate to areas where they may or may not be tracked by their predators or parasitoids, resulting in spatial desynchronization [
 <xref rid="B73-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. The final outcome depends partially on the competence of corresponding natural enemy species to expand their geographic range or on the possibility of new natural enemy populations that could control the pest in its new habitat [
 <xref rid="B69-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. In the absence of these conditions, herbivores may be able to escape predation and build large populations in their new habitat [
 <xref rid="B164-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>]. The potential for natural enemies to pursue their hosts depends primarily on their environmental tolerance relative to their herbivorous hosts, as well as their movement rates [
 <xref rid="B69-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Gilman et al. [
 <xref rid="B165-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>] suggested that natural enemies that are specialists are more likely to be affected by climate change than generalists because they are less able to adapt to spatial desynchronization with their host communities. In such a case, biological control in food webs composed of many generalists might be more resilient to climate change [
