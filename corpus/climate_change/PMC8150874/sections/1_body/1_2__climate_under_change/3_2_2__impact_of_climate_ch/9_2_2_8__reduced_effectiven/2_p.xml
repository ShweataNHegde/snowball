<p>Aphids are among the insect pests that are controlled by many natural enemy species, such as parasitic wasps, which lay their eggs in the bodies of aphids, and predatory species, such as ladybirds. All of these species are affected by the effects of global warming and could respond differently to temperature changes [

 <xref rid="B107-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. Hance et al. [
 <xref rid="B60-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] reported that if a natural enemy starts to develop at a slightly lower temperature than the prey (e.g., aphid) and develops faster than the prey when the temperature rises, a too early and warm spring leads to its early emergence and a high probability of death from lack of prey. If this phenomenon is repeated over several years, it may lead to the extinction of the natural enemy. Evans et al. [
 <xref rid="B163-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>] showed that a rise in temperature disrupted the biological control of the Cereal leaf beetle (
 <italic>Oulema melanopus</italic> L.). In this trophic system, the development of 
 <italic>O. melanopus</italic> was more affected by warming than that of the natural enemy, resulting in a phenological shift between enemy and prey and a weakening of biological control.
