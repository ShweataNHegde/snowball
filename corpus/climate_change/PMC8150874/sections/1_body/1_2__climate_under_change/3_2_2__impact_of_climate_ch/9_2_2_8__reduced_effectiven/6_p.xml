<p>Ultimately, climate change and global warming affect higher trophic levels directly, by altering the behaviour of natural enemies, or indirectly, by altering physiological traits in host plants and behavioural traits in herbivorous insects. Given all these facts, it is important to assess the trophic system as a whole. A challenge for the future is to develop models based on knowledge of phenological processes obtained through long-term monitoring of herbivores, their associated natural enemies and host plants, and their response to current climate and climate change [
