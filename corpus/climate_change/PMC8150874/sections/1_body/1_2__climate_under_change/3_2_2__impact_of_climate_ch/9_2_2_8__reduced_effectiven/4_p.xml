<p>Elevated CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration, altered precipitation patterns, and temperature increase modify plant phenology and productivity, which in turn affect the growth and abundance of herbivore populations (host insects) and indirectly influence the supply of prey and hosts available for predation or parasitism [

 <xref rid="B69-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Thomson et al. [
 <xref rid="B69-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] also found that plants grown under elevated CO
 <sub>2</sub>, temperature extremes, and reduced precipitation provide diverse nutritional resources for herbivores, indirectly affecting the fitness of parasitoids and predators that feed on these herbivorous hosts. Bezemer et al. [
 <xref rid="B66-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] studied the effect of temperature increase and elevated CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration on the synchronized population of a tritrophic system consisting of the host plant annual bluegrass (
 <italic>Poa annua</italic> L.), the pest green peach aphid (
 <italic>M. persicae</italic>) and the parasitoid wasp (
 <italic>Aphidius matricariae</italic> Haliday). They showed that aphid populations built up under both elevated temperature and elevated CO
 <sub>2</sub>. There was no information on an effect of elevated CO
 <sub>2</sub> on parasitism success, but parasitism increased in correlation with elevated temperature. Another study examining the efficiency of the parasitoid wasp (
 <italic>Aphidius picipes</italic> Nees) feeding on the English grain aphid (
 <italic>Sitobion avenae</italic> F.) showed that parasitism increased in correlation with elevated CO
 <sub>2</sub>, but the same elevated CO
 <sub>2</sub> level resulted in lower fecundity of the wasps [
