<p>Increased survival during overwintering period could lead to an increase in overwintering population and therefore to a greater abundance of insects on plants during the warmer period of a year. Consequently, global warming would increase the build-up of insect populations, early infestations and resultant crop damage from insect pests [

 <italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic> Hubner). Consequently, this appears to be a significant threat to yield loss and a major challenge for pest management in corn, a fundamental food crop in the United States [
