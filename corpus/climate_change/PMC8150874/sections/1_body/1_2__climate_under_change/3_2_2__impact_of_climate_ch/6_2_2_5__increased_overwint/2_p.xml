<p>Diapause is a fundamental requirement for overwintering success of many species in temperate and colder climates, and it confers increased cold hardiness (an organismâ€™s ability to survive at low temperatures) in the absence of acclimation to low temperatures, which usually occurs naturally during the transition from summer to fall and winter [
 <xref rid="B100-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Some insect species enter diapause during the inactive egg or pupal stages, while others do it as larvae, nymphs, or adults. When diapause occurs in the inactive stages, it is often accompanied by a sharp drop in metabolic rate that is accompanied by an increase in cold hardiness [
 <xref rid="B96-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. During larval diapause, which is likely more common in subterranean herbivores that are protected from low temperatures, feeding may continue and forward development may slow down rather than stop [
