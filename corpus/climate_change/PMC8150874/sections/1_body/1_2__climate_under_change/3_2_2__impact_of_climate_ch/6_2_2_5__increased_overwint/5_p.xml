<p>Good synchronization with the environment and host plant means that insect herbivores are well adapted to their habitats [
 <xref rid="B106-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. However, climate warming can disrupt the metabolic balance during diapause, which can significantly affect the timing of emergence, so any change in spring emergence could lead to a loss of synchrony with the environment or host plant [

 <xref rid="B106-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. For example, many insects rely on synchrony between the timing of bud burst (or flowering) and emergence of feeding stages. It is quite conceivable that under current predictions of climate change, synchrony between trophic levels could become uncoupled as a consequence of subtle environmental differences in the phenology of individual species [
 <xref rid="B107-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. One of the best-studied examples of this is the Winter moth (
 <italic>Operophtera brumata</italic> L.), in which egg hatching is markedly advanced compared to bud break on its host plant, the Pedunculate oak (
 <italic>Quercus robur</italic> L.). It is unlikely that a 2 Â°C increase in temperature will dramatically alter the timing of bud burst, but the timing of larval hatching is likely to be significantly advanced, possibly leading to larval hatching before bud burst, which is dangerous for the moth and could reduce this specific pest problem [
