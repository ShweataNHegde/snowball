<p>It appears that univoltine temperate species respond differently to warmer winter conditions, making it difficult to predict the precise effects of climate change on overwintering insect species [
 <xref rid="B109-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. Non-diapausing, frost-sensitive species and those that can overwinter in their active stages appear to have increased survival rates under warmer winter conditions. These insect pests are expected to build up their populations and expand their geographic ranges to higher altitudes as average temperatures there increase [
 <xref rid="B49-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Extremely low winter temperatures increases winter mortality, which is considered a key factor in the dynamics of many temperate insects, especially those that do not go into diapause but are active throughout the winter when temperature permits [
 <xref rid="B108-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Warmer winters or a reduction in the frequency of extreme cold periods may, therefore, improve the survival of such species, as they are not exposed to low lethal temperature extremes [
 <xref rid="B96-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. However, insects exhibit a variety of strategies in relation to the threat of lethal low temperatures and these will partly determine the impact of warmer winter conditions [
