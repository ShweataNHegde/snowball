<p>The flight phenology of aphids can be an accurate biological indicator of climate warming [
 <xref rid="B114-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. Many authors have shown that an increase in temperature promotes the survival of overwintering anholocyclic aphid species in the United Kingdom and in some cases brings forward their flight onset by up to one month. Such changes caused by climate warming will increase aphid outbreaks and cause earlier spring migrations, giving populations a better chance to build up to damaging levels in the subsequent growing season with a prolonged virus infection period [

Horticultural pests of plants grown in and restricted to greenhouses will have more opportunities to survive outdoors as average temperatures increase. For instance, warmer winter conditions are likely to increase the probability of the invasive South American leaf miner (
