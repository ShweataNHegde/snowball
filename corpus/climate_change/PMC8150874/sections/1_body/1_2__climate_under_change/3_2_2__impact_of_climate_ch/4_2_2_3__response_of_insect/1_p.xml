<p>Changes in the amount, intensity, and frequency of precipitation are very important indicators of climate change. As observed in most events, the frequency of precipitation has decreased while the intensity of precipitation has increased. This type of rainfall pattern has favoured the occurrence of droughts and floods. Insect species that overwinter in the soil are directly affected by overlapping rainfall. In short, heavy rainfall can lead to flooding and prolonged stagnation of water. This event threatens insect survival and at least affects their diapause (

 <xref rid="B76-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] studied the effects of increased summer rainfall and drought on the Soil-dwelling wireworm (
 <italic>Agriotes lineatus</italic> L.) in grassland plots. Wireworms are very damaging pests of crops such as potatoes, corn, sugar beet, etc., especially when grown in grassland plots, and there are predictions that they are likely to become a much greater problem with the effects of climate change [

 <xref rid="B76-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] found rapid growth of wireworm populations in the upper part of the soil as a result of increased summer rainfall events as opposed to ambient and drought conditions [

Herbivorous insects are affected by drought through several mechanisms; (I) dry climates may provide suitable environmental conditions for the development and growth of herbivorous insects; (II) drought-stressed plants attract some insect species. For example, when plants lose moisture through the process of transpiration, water columns in the xylem break apart or cavitate, producing an ultrasonic acoustic emission that is detected by harmful bark beetles (Scolytidae); (III) plants stressed by drought are more susceptible to insect attack because of a decrease in the production of secondary metabolites that have a defense function [
