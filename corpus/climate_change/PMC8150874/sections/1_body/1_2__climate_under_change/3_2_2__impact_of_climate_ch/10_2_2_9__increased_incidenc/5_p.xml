<p>Among whiteflies, the Greenhouse whitefly (
 <italic>Trialeurodes vaporariorum</italic> Westwood) and the Silver leaf whitefly (
 <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic> Gennadius) are most important virus vectors. Moderate precipitation and high temperatures are generally favourable for 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> and lead to population increases [
 <xref rid="B186-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>]. Environments with dry and hot climates with installed irrigation systems provide favourable conditions for 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic>. Considering their short generation time, large populations can develop in summer. The same conditions could lead to an increase in the rate of evolution of the virus, resulting in more efficient strains with broader host range, greater transmission efficiency, and larger virus reservoirs in crops. Extreme winds and increased cyclonic activity in the tropics, as predicted by climate change scenarios, could promote the spread of 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic>. Drought could decrease its survival rate and disrupt its development, as well as restrain population size and dispersal [

 <sub>2</sub> levels, it is predicted that many more geographical regions worldwide will be suitable for outdoor tomato production. These regions may also become suitable for the establishment of 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> populations and thus for the increased incidence of the highly damaging pathogen of tomatoâ€”tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) [
