<p>Global warming may favour the occurrence of insect-transmitted plant diseases due to geographic expansion and increases in populations of insect vectors [

 <xref rid="B176-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>]. The main order of insects that transmit plant viruses are the sap-feeding Hemiptera. Within this order, the families of aphids (Aphididae), leafhoppers (Cicadellidae) and whiteflies (Aleyrodidae) are the major vectors of viral diseases [
 <xref rid="B177-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>]. Among these, aphids are the largest group of vectors, transmitting more than 275 virus species, and the majority of aphid species are capable of transmitting some plant viruses. Aphids are crucial virus vectors in temperate zones of the world, while whiteflies are restricted to warmer areas and thrive in temperate regions in crops grown under greenhouse conditions [
 <xref rid="B174-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>]. The short development time and high reproductive capacity of aphids and whiteflies make them particularly sensitive to responses to climate change [
 <xref rid="B60-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The migration potential and long-distance dispersal of virus vectors could also be affected by climate change. Aphids can travel long distances when they encounter favourable thermal conditions that launch them upward, where atmospheric air movements expose them to horizontal translocation [
 <xref rid="B178-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>]. This long-distance transport has been linked with severe viral epidemics caused by aphids transported by extremely persistent low-pressure winds from the Great Plains of North America in the south to corn-growing areas in Minnesota [
