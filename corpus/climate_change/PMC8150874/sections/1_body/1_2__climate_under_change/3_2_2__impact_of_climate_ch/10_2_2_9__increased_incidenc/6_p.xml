<p>Grapevine yellows are grapevine diseases associated with phytoplasmas. They show notable differences in epidemiology due to the different life histories of their associated insect vectors [
 <xref rid="B188-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>]. One of the most important grapevine diseases in Europe is Flavescence dorée [
 <xref rid="B189-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>], and its main vector is the American grapevine leafhopper (
 <italic>Scaphoideus titanus</italic> Ball) [
 <xref rid="B190-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>]. As average temperatures increase during the growing season, 
 <italic>S. titanus</italic> is expanding its range northward [
 <xref rid="B191-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>]. While short summers are considered a barrier to the northern spread of 
 <italic>S. titanus</italic> due to the insect’s inability to reach its full life cycle [
 <xref rid="B192-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>,
 <xref rid="B193-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>], climate change with longer and hotter summers should favour the spread of 
 <italic>S. titanus</italic> in northern vineyards such as in Germany by extending the favourable development period [
 <xref rid="B191-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>]. Currently, 
 <italic>S. titanus</italic> is widely spread in many vine growing areas across the Europe. Mirutenko et al. [
 <xref rid="B193-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>] reported the occurrence of 
 <italic>S. titanus</italic> in Ukraine, which is currently its northern limit of distribution in Europe. However, climate warming at the southern limit of its current range could lead to insect declines or extinctions of small populations in areas such as southern Italy [
