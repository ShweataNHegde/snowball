<p>It has also been reported that an increase in temperature in Northern Europe, especially at the beginning of the growing season, increases the rate of viral diseases in potato due to earlier colonisation by aphids, the main vectors of potato viruses [

 <xref rid="B180-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">180</xref>]. The severity of viral diseases is highly dependent on the timing of infection and the amount of inoculum. The amount of viral inoculum is influenced by the overwintering of its insect vectors and their (alternative) host plants [
 <xref rid="B181-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>]. Aphids are expected to have higher survival rates in milder winters, and higher spring/summer temperatures increase their development and reproduction rates. The final outcome is a higher incidence of viral disease transmission and spread [
