<p>Insects are important vectors that transmit many plant diseases such as viruses, phytoplasmas and bacteria [
 <xref rid="B169-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>]. Viruses are a major cause of many plant diseases in global food production. The estimated economic loss from these diseases exceeds $30 billion per year [
 <xref rid="B170-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>]. Outside their vector or host insect, viruses are immovable and therefore heavily dependent on their vectors for transmission and spread. Some viruses and vectors are host generalists and others are specialists with a specific mode of transmission. Vectors can vary in their transmission efficiency, so the persistence, spread and prevalence of viruses depend on the particular vectors, their host plant and the climatic conditions in which they thrive [

 <xref rid="B173-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>]. Most viruses of agricultural crop species are messenger RNA viruses and single-stranded DNA viruses. Their main host-to-host transmission strategy is the use of insect vectors with mouthparts for piercing and sucking [
 <xref rid="B174-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>]. In the previous sections, we have described the effects of climate change on various insect pests, some of which act as vectors of viruses. As climate directly affects insect physiology, phenology, etc., it could indirectly affect the viruses they transmit. This influence could have positive, negative or neutral consequences for the emergence and development of viral diseases in crop production [
