<p>Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) causes a very damaging disease in the Poaceae family and is transmitted by various aphid vectors. In Central Europe, the temperature minimum for migration of the Bird cherry oat aphid (
 <italic>Rhopalosiphum padi</italic> L.), the main vector of BYDV, is 8 °C, based on long-term monitoring. In addition, population build-up in summer is determined by temperatures in autumn, and population build-up in autumn is dependent on precipitation patterns and extremely low temperatures in winter [

In summer, warm temperatures and low rainfall reduce host availability, which poses various challenges for viruses and their insect vectors. Temperatures above 36 °C in warmest summer months result in decreased survival of aphids, reducing the spread of BYDV [
