<p>Currently available pest management strategies such as detection, prediction, physical control, chemical control, and biological control could be intensified to control pests in response to climate change [

Due to the transboundary nature of many insect pests, a global management approach is needed for monitoring and risk assessment to be effective. A global system for sharing information between regions, including important information on insects, invasive alien species, diseases, and ecological conditions, including weather data, is needed. Therefore, it is important to improve cooperation between countries and regions, including national, regional, and global organizations [

Entry point monitoring and rapid eradication, as exemplified by the US Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Early Warning and Rapid Response Program and the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization’s (EPPO) Early Warning and Information System for IAS, will continue to be important when addressing invasive species [
