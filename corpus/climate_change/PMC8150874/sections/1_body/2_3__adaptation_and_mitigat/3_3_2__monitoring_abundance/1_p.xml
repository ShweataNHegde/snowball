<p>One of the most important prerequisites for determining whether climate change is altering the population dynamics of insect pest species is access to long-term data [
 <xref rid="B206-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>]. Without these important baseline data, it is extremely difficult to fully assess changes in pest populations under changing climate regimes and also to predict future population dynamics [
 <xref rid="B201-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">201</xref>]. Long-term monitoring of pest populations and behaviour, particularly in climate change-sensitive regions, may provide some of the first clues to biological responses to climate change [
 <xref rid="B207-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">207</xref>]. Changes in the dynamics of vectors, diseases and host populations at the local level need to be monitored, as do changes in their geographical distribution. New invasive species are being introduced in many parts of the world, aided by climate change. Effective monitoring and management systems are needed to prevent invasive species from becoming an economic pest in new geographic regions [

 <xref rid="B208-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">208</xref>]. Therefore, adaptive responses in both pest management and biosecurity will be required.
