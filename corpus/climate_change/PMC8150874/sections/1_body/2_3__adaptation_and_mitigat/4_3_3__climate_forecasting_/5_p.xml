<p>Mechanistic species distribution models differ from correlative models in that they examine how the environment constrains physiological performance in a given region. Future species distributions are then predicted through a process of elimination, whereby regions that constrain physiological performance to the extent that they affect the ability to survive, grow, or reproduce are excluded from the final distribution [
 <xref rid="B216-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">216</xref>]. It has also been argued that mechanistic models are the preferred approach to most management questions because they are able to extrapolate beyond known conditions and isolate traits that determine biogeography [

CLIMEX is an example of a semi-mechanistic modelling software tool that uses the physiological and behavioural parameters of species and the values of climate variables to make predictions about suitable habitats or regions for specific species [

In addition, comprehensive analysis of climate and historical weather records, together with development of the models described above, will facilitate prediction of pest risks. This could be reflected in the development of proactive strategies for pest prevention and control strategies in a changing climate [
