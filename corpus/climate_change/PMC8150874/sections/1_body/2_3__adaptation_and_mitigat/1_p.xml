<p>Climate change adaptation can be viewed as an ongoing process of implementing existing risk management strategies and reducing the potential risk from climate change impacts [
 <xref rid="B194-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>]. Climate change is widely expected to make pest infestations more unpredictable and increase their geographic range. Coupled with the uncertainty of how climate change will directly affect crop yields, the interactions between insects and plants in ecosystems remain unclear [
 <xref rid="B78-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. The adaptive capacity of agricultural production systems will depend on several biological, economic, and sociological factors. The ability of local communities to adapt their pest management practices will depend on their physical, social and financial resources [
 <xref rid="B71-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. With climate change and the acceleration of global trade, uncertainties and frequency of occurrence of existing and new pests will increase. Increasing the ability to adapt rapidly to disturbances and climatic changes will therefore become all the more important [
 <xref rid="B195-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">195</xref>]. Potential adaptation strategies have been identified to reduce the risks of spreading new pests and diseases, and to mitigate the negative impacts of existing pests. The most commonly mentioned strategies are modified integrated pest management (IPM) practices, monitoring climate and insect pest populations and the use of modeling predictions tools [
