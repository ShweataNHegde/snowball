<p>Many IPM programs have focused on decisions based on extensive knowledge of how many insect pests can be tolerated before economic yield losses occur, also known as economic or intervention thresholds. IPM has historically evolved in the pest management field where the use of established thresholds has yielded good results. Although intervention thresholds play an important role in IPM, they are not always relevant, sufficient, or possible. When decision support systems are not available or appropriate, the use of thresholds is neglected [

Understanding how the environment affects plant and pest development is critical, and understanding their interactions with the environment allows crop advisors to respond to climate change. Environmental factors such as drought stress affect crop protection recommendations. When a crop is under drought stress, it is less able to cope with the additional stress caused by herbivorous insects, which can easily lower the economic threshold [

Due to the faster development of insects at higher temperatures, populations develop faster and crop damage occurs earlier than currently expected. Therefore, treatment thresholds based on the number of insects per plant must be lowered to prevent unacceptable yield losses [
