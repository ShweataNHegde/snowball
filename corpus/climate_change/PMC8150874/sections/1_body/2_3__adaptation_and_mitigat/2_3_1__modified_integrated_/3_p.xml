<p>Mainly, growers and researchers design IPM strategies to minimize negative impacts on the environment while maximizing crop yields and economic returns [

Many authors have discussed the problem of pest management in a novel environment with a changing climate and the need to reconsider existing preventive agricultural practises and IPM strategies to improve heterogeneous agroecosystems that are resilient enough to tolerate weather variability [
