<p>The use of pheromones and allelochemicals is an important method by which insects sense their environment. They play a substantial role in various IPM techniques such as biological control, mating disruption, push-pull strategies, monitoring and trapping [
 <xref rid="B202-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">202</xref>]. As the climate warms and microclimates become more variable, the use of pheromones and allelochemicals in their current form is expected to become less effective and may require a synergist or other adjuvant to reduce their volatility under high temperature conditions [
 <xref rid="B201-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">201</xref>]. In addition, some biopesticides based on enthomopathogenic viruses, fungi, bacteria, and nematodes are extremely susceptible to environmental changes. An increase in temperature and a decrease in relative humidity may cause some of these management techniques to be less effective, and a similar result is expected for synthetic insecticides [
 <xref rid="B203-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">203</xref>]. In this context, the focus should be on the development of new pest management strategies and possible new formulations of insecticides as well as attractants and repellents. For example, Wenda-Piesik et al. [
 <xref rid="B204-insects-12-00440" ref-type="bibr">204</xref>] in their study, investigated the behavioural response of confused flour beetle (
 <italic>Tribolium confusum</italic> Du Val) to different concentration of environmentally friendly volatile organic compounds (VOC) in terms of their repellent and attractive properties. As a result, they confirmed that highest concentration of applied VOC repelled individuals of given species significantly. This research can serve as a basis for the development of new sustainable and environmentally friendly pest control agents.
