<p id="Par4">Despite the excellent body of research that has being amassed further work remains. Gond et. al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2017</xref>) presented six research deficits through their insightful review of psychological microfoundations of corporate social responsibility. This article will seek to address two of these challenges relating to “mechanisms of reactions” and “new and more relevant individual differences that operate as drivers”, while seeking to establish why managers remain complacent on the issue of climate change despite the clear imperative for action. Informed by the work of Gond et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2017</xref>), Gond and Moser (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2019</xref>) and Groschl et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2019</xref>) our research, through a systematic review, will establish a clear understanding of the theoretical constructs of cognition, sensemaking and managerial interpretation, their relation to each other and to the issues of climate change, before examining the complexity of factors shaping these constructs. The scope of the research presented in our paper will be broadened beyond that of Gond et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2017</xref>) to consider both positive and negative influences that herein have been termed ‘factors’ rather than ‘drivers’. A systematic review is appropriate to establish a synthesis of existing literature based on the rigourous assembly, analysis and interpretation (Rousseau et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2008</xref>) of the three foundational cognitive research areas to provide an understanding of the current state of research.
