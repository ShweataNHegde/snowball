<p id="Par5">Through this research we will make three key contributions. Our first contribution will be to develop a systematic analysis of research on cognition, sensemaking and managerial interpretation linked contextually to sustainability and climate change with concept clarification as it relates to levels of analysis (the individual, organisation or general population). The second contribution is through the development of a construct specific, multilevel review of the factors which shape each of these cognitive foundational areas grouped into individual, organisational and societal levels. Our third contribution is a framework demonstrating the interplay between the cognitive perspectives, their construction and their relationship to outcomes (further cognitive change or behavioural action). Finally, a discussion based on this research presents three key issues leading to complacency and three paths to overcoming the inaction of decision makers on climate change.</p>
