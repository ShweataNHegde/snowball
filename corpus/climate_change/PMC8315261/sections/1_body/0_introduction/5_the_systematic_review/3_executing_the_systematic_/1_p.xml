<p id="Par21">Conducting the initial review returned 724 articles within the Scopus database. Details of these articles (including title, abstract, author, journal, year of publication) were downloaded into an Excel file. This initial number of articles was examined for duplication of entries. There were multiple instances where articles contained references to both sustainability and one or both of the other search references. Once duplicates were removed 567 articles remained to be considered for analysis. All 567 articles were downloaded and reviewed to verify that they actually contained the search terms in the appropriate context. Articles were excluded from the data set for several reasons including not actually relating to sustainability (e.g. content about sustainable competitive advantage) or containing a general reference to cognitive/cognition without any depth (e.g. a mention of cognitive bias) or where the concept was not a key aspect of the article.</p>
