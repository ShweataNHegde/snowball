<p id="Par34">These 61 articles have been the subject of further focussed analysis with details provided in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> below. Examining the distribution of the 61 articles shows that the Journal of Business Ethics and the Journal of Cleaner Production have dominated the discussion in question consistently over the last decade. Consistent with the larger data set just 10 out of the 61 (16%) were theoretical in nature highlighting the need for further theoretical investigation to support this growing research focus.
