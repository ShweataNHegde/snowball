<p id="Par33">Of the 219 articles coded, 61 were found to contain either cognition, sensemaking or managerial interpretation as a key conceptual focus (34 cognition; 22 sensemaking; 5 managerial interpretation). Originally only two articles were located with a focus on managerial interpretation. Due to the low numbers of articles being returned a second separate review was completed examining the articles which referenced the original Sharma article from the year 2000. Of the 966 articles which cited Sharma (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2000</xref>) in Scopus, 299 articles came from the journals considered in this review. The abstracts of each of these 299 articles were then reviewed to establish whether they were in fact about managerial interpretation or whether it was a minor citation within the text. Only two of the articles contained the complete term ‘managerial interpretation’ in their abstract, title or key words in addition to containing content on a sustainability-related topic; however, the simplified term ‘interpret’ identified 14 articles. The sustainability-related topic verification resulted in five remaining articles of which two were already contained in the data set. This process resulted in an additional three files which were included in the review.
