<p id="Par6">The research problem addressed within this article has been examined through a systematic review of business and management literature.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2003</xref>; Williams et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2017</xref>). The methodology applied within the systematic review followed an established process based on the structure of past reviews by Williams et. al. (
