<p id="Par19">Consistent with the necessity for literature included in the systematic review to be of the highest academic rigor a list of quality journals was completed. To identify appropriate journals initially a list of 49 potential journals was compiled based on past high quality reviews (Kaplan, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2011</xref>; Williams et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2017</xref>). This list was then compared to the Australian Business Dean’s Council (ABDC) quality list. Where journals were ranked A or A* they were automatically included. Five journals received a lower rank on the ABDC list so their Scientific Journal Ranking (SJR) was examined. Where the SJR was over the level of one the journal was included; however, three of the five fell below this level and were excluded from the analysis. The final list is provided in Table
