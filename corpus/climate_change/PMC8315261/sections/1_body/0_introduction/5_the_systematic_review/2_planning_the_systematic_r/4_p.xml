<p id="Par20">The management database Scopus was selected as the search engine to be used to locate the appropriate articles based on its potential to include high ranking, peer-reviewed journals. Search terms were expanded beyond cognition to include sensemaking and managerial interpretation to capture core cognitive process literature in the review. The initial search included the terms cognit*; sensemak*; or manager* interpret* within the title, abstract and keywords and the results for these searches were then further filtered for terms of sustain*; natural environ*; or climate change within the article.</p>
