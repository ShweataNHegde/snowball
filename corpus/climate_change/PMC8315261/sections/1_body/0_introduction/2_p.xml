<p id="Par3">Management studies has evolved over the last 75 years to include cognitive perspectives in addition to the dominant economic view (Fassin et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2011</xref>). Increasingly management researchers are looking to the foundations of strategy which focus not on the actions and strategies themselves but on individuals and their interactions to comprehend the decision-making process (Felin et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2015</xref>; Gond &amp; Moser, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2019</xref>; Gond et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2017</xref>; Groschl et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2019</xref>; Hahn et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2014</xref>). A branch of CSR research has recently emerged termed micro-CSR to capture research in these areas with streams identified as psychological or sociological (Gond &amp; Moser, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2019</xref>). Reaching back for over three decades academics such as Weick (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">1988</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">1993</xref>), Sharma (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2000</xref>), and Kaplan (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2008</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2011</xref>) have provided insight into the cognitive processes that occur when decisions are made in complex environments through research on cognition, sensemaking and managerial interpretation. Linked to Herbert Simon’s (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">1957</xref>) concept of bounded rationality, research on cognitive processes acknowledge the difficulty in accounting for multiple factors from a diverse array of areas (Fassin et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2011</xref>) including, operational, financial, strategic and stakeholder factors when making a decision.
