<p id="Par73">Often studied in the context of managers, sensemaking is regularly followed by a process of sensegiving, thereby enacting the realisation of the frame constructed through the sensemaking process (Fontana, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2019</xref>). Sensegiving occurs when an individual seeks to convey their sensemaking to relevant others (Tisch &amp; Galbreath, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2018</xref>), a social interaction creating a shared meaning. Managers play a significant role in the change process as sensemakers and sensegivers as they are both in the position to promote their sensemaking to achieve a dominant frame but also more likely to have access to the slack resources required to invest in change (Schaltenbrand et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2018</xref>). Hahn et. al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2014</xref>) highlight the connection between sensemaking and cognitive framing where an individualâ€™s frame influences their scanning and in turn their interpretation of a given situation.
