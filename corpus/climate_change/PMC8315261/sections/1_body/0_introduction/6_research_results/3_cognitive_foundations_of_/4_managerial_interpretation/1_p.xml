 <italic>Managerial interpretations and organisational context as predictors of corporate choice of environmental strategy</italic>. Within the article Sharma outlines a model where managerial interpretation is linked to

 <italic>employee performance evaluation</italic> with feedback loops between 
 <italic>environmental strategy</italic> and 
 <italic>issue legitimation </italic>and 
 <italic>managerial interpretation</italic>. Based on data from firms within the Canadian oil and gas industry, the overall findings of the article proposed an association between the way managers interpreted an issue as a threat or opportunity and the strategies taken by the firm. Examining interpretation in greater detail literature proposes that managers apply frames, or categories to uncertain events or issues, shaping the ongoing process (Haney,
