 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2018b</xref>) find that dynamic capabilities support the managerial interpretation process. Haney (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2017</xref>) examined the proposed link between threat perception and innovation in relation to climate change, with interpretation associated with the microfoundations of dynamic capability development. The article finds that two mechanisms positively impact the association between these factors, responsibility to society and moral legitimacy (Haney,
