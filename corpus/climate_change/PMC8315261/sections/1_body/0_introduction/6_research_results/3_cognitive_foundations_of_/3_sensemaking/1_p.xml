<p id="Par72">The concept of sensemaking was first proposed then popularised by Weick (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">1988</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">1993</xref> and Weick et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2005</xref>) to describe the process by which individuals develop cognitive structures around the complex and unknown so that it can be acted upon (Ancona, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2011</xref>). The theory has become highly influential to researchers within the field of organisational studies (van der Heijden &amp; Cramer, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2017</xref>). Managing to promote sustainability meeting the challenges of a climate change transition is defined by complexity and trade-offs. Events may occur contrary to an individualâ€™s existing formation of meaning (Bien &amp; Sassen, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2020</xref>). Sensemaking is a process of interpretation where organisational actors attach meaning to events to mediate uncertainty (Fontana, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2019</xref>; Tisch &amp; Galbreath, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2018</xref>; Weick, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">1993</xref>) forming a foundation frame for individuals to use as an established point of reference (van der Heijden et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2010</xref>). Three key sequential processes are reported to occur through sensemaking, specifically scanning, interpreting and responding (Hahn et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2014</xref>). When faced with a new situation to which they have no prior frame individuals cannot develop an interpretation without first understanding its content (van Der Heijden et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2010</xref>), in turn determining the adequacy of the response. The greater the level of sensemaking the higher the chance that the individuals involved will be able to successfully manage effects that arise, the reverse is also true that poor sensemaking may equate to suboptimal management (Tisch &amp; Galbreath, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2018</xref>).
