<p id="Par39">Combined within this section two theoretical concepts will be presented, that of cognition and cognitive framing. The concept of managerial cognition has been defined in a variety of ways from the simplistic view of “how and what managers think about and understand various firm issues that require action” (p533) by Madhavaram et. al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2011</xref>). This prior research supports the assumption that managers are limited by bounded rationality when making sense of complex, unpredictable environments and that managerial cognition is subjective to factors such as prior experience and individual characteristics which shape cognitive frames of reference (Lin &amp; McDonough, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2014</xref>; Shang et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2010</xref>). Similarly managerial decision-making on climate change is defined by just such complexity and uncertainty.
