<p id="Par40">Cognitive frames, shaped by managerial cognition, have been presented by academics as a concept to represent the generalised views used by managers to understand their environment (Barr et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1992</xref>; Goffman, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1974</xref>; Hahn et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2014</xref>; Kaplan, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2011</xref>; Walsh, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">1995</xref>). Within research examining cognition of individual managers it can be viewed as a process combining subconscious and directed attention shaped by an array of elements from an individual’s background and experience including factors within the organisation in which they work and the society in which they live. An individual’s cognitive frame shapes their view of a given situation in terms of the way they look for and assimilate knowledge (Kaplan, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2008</xref>). A manager’s frame dictates their ability to manage potentially conflicting management pressures or issues. Research has been conducted into the orientation of a manager’s cognitive frame and its implications for strategic management styles such as the degree of ambidexterity (Hahn et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2014</xref>; Sharma &amp; Jaiswal, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2018</xref>). The greater the experience of an individual in a given organisational environment, the greater the complexity of frame, directing their search for information under the scanning process of sensemaking (Hahn et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2014</xref>; Schaltenbrand et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2018</xref>). Further, recent studies have specifically considered the direction of an individual manager’s cognitive frame for making sense of sustainability issues, consequences for action and the management of tensions in decision makers (Hahn et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2014</xref>; Sharma &amp; Jaiswal, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2018</xref>). For a given change event a series of frames are possible dependent on factors such as an individual’s knowledge, prior experience and alliances. These links between frame complexity and the path dependency of frame development have considerable implications for understanding managerial complacency on climate change issues. The question remains as to whether managers with little experience of the complex and transformational nature of changes arising through climate impacts and decarbonising reform have the complexity of frame to consider solutions to act.
