<p id="Par126">Organisations themselves were also found to shape managerial decisions. A manager’s experience guides their perception of a given situation, their ability to accommodate new knowledge and their likelihood of action. The organisation shapes action through its systems, culture and availability of slack resources, a factor often dependent on financial performance. The managers ability to scan the environment is proposed to increase in complexity the longer the individual is employed in a single industry (Schaltenbrand et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2018</xref>). Scholars have suggested that experienced individuals, with more advanced cognitive structures, approach a problem in a different way to their less experienced counterparts (Schaltenbrand et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2018</xref>). Factors including the company’s financial situation (Peng &amp; Liu, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2016</xref>; Schaltenbrand et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2018</xref>), CSR policies (Aguinis &amp; Glavas, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2019</xref>), and an individual’s work orientation (Eberhardt-Toth &amp; Wasieleski, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2013</xref>) contribute to cognition, sensemaking and cognitive framing. Research has suggested that managers within different positions within a company differ in their cognitive development (Eberhardt-Toth &amp; Wasieleski, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2013</xref>; Hahn et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2014</xref>). Eberhardt-Toth and Wasieleski (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2013</xref>) were surprised to find that contrary to their expectations, the financial managers scored higher in their cognitive moral development than their non-financial counterparts. Other researchers have proposed that when a manager’s functional background in internally focussed areas such as engineering or accounting they may be more interested in internal factors, whereas managers from externally focussed areas such as marketing are more likely to look to stakeholder demands (Hahn et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2014</xref>). Considering the high cognitive moral development in financial managers Eberhardt-Toth and Wasieleski (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2013</xref>) identified that they may have underestimated the boundary spanning activities of the individuals.
