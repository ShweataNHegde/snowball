<p id="Par51">Many articles have specifically examined cognition through the lens of framing. Research has defined frames as cognitive ‘‘knowledge structure that directs and guides information processing’’ (Cornelissen &amp; Werner, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2014</xref>, p. 184; Haney, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2017</xref>). Formed by and informing the process of cognition and sensemaking, cognitive frames are an integral part of the interpretations and overall decision-making process relating to sustainability and climate change. Frames play a central role in directing strategic decisions within organisations (Kaplan, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2008</xref>). Hahn et. al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2014</xref>) found, when regarding sustainability issues, managers may take either a business or a paradoxical frame. They further proposed that these frames shape decision-making in terms of its scope, level of innovation, speed and risk intensity. Under cognitive framing theory once managers have interpreted a situation based on their individual frame, they will adopt a certain decision with regards to an issue. A manager’s frame may alter over time due to the influence of experience (Bergman et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2019</xref>; Grewatsch &amp; Kleindienst, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2018</xref>; Liao, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2016</xref>; Zuzul, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2019</xref>) on the complex combinations of factors which form cognition. Research suggests that managerial responses to given situations highlight how the frames used and the decisions made by management are highly dependent on previous experience (Hahn et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2014</xref>). Again, raising the role of experience, this time with reference to frame formation, strongly supports the connection between complacency and inexperience of climate change/sustainability action.
