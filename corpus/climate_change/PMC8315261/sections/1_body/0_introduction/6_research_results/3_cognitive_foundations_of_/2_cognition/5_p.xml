<p id="Par49">Articles describing cognition at a managerial level focus on the role of cognition in shaping the decision-making process and outcomes, and factors shaping cognition itself. The existence of tensions and trade-offs in the management of sustainability issues has been well established (Hahn et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2014</xref>; Pinkse &amp; Kolk 2010). Cognition has been presented in the articles reviewed as shaping the way individuals deal with tensions. Examples can be identified in the development of a corporate climate change strategy where a multistage process was adopted balancing local knowledge and capabilities in a multinational organisation (Lei et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2017</xref>), or, where managerial cognition on environmental factors was balanced with external resource acquisitions in the development of eco-innovation activities within a company (Peng &amp; Liu, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2016</xref>). These two examples demonstrate the complexity of factors challenging corporate action on climate change, including variations in knowledge, culture and resources, as well as the temporality of progress on sustainability.
