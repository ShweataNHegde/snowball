<p id="Par84">The social context plus the leader’s self-identity shape the selection of sensemaking cues (Bien &amp; Sassen, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2020</xref>). Once an executive manager has constructed meaning, potentially framing a new vision for the company, a process of sensegiving may follow through which the individual seeks bring the vision to reality through communication (Bien &amp; Sassen, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2020</xref>; Fontana, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2019</xref>). Fontana (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2019</xref>) in their research on diffusing environmental innovations in Bangladesh apparel companies provided an interesting analysis linking “patterns” of sensemaking, which we consider could be interpreted as frames, contextually shaped by past individual, environmental and social factors to investment decisions. While the situation was shaped by contextual events such as the Rana Plaza collapse disaster the study linked investment to the executive’s emotions and social status desires. Critically the results of the article found that although 90% of the 30 executives did not associate investment in environmental innovation to positive financial performance, or the expectation of any direct financial benefit, 70%, however, did associate the investment with higher social recognition (Fontana, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2019</xref>). Understanding this perceived lack of association between action on sustainability issues and financial benefit may elucidate part of the reason for managerial complacency particularly when considered through the traditional business lens of profit maximisation.
