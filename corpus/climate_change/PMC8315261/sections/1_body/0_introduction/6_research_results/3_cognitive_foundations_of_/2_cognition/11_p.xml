<p id="Par71">Examining the core concepts defining the process of developing and applying cognition and cognitive framing three key descriptive areas emerged from the analysis.

To this end they are shaped by factors at an individual level, through the organisation in which the individual works and the society in which they live, they also act to reduce complexity managing tensions and paradox. Understanding the core concepts of cognition and cognitive framing provides insight into potential reasons for complacency while also providing direction on intervention points to drive progress.
