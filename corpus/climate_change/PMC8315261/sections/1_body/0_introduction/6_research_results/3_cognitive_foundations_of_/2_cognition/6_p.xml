<p id="Par50">Further tightening the lens on processes forming cognition on sustainability/climate change several articles discussed the dual process shaping an individual’s cognition. Researchers Eberhardt-Toth and Wasieleski (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2013</xref>) and Zollo (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2021</xref>) highlighted the two aspects of cognition in the explicit (conscious and effortful) and the implicit (effortless automatic) aspects that combine to shape an individual’s cognition. The implicit aspect is actioned automatically to evaluate a problem with the explicit aspect able to override the automatic reaction through effortful thought and problem solving (Eberhardt-Toth &amp; Wasieleski, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2013</xref>). Both studies link decisions to moral development with Zollo (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2021</xref>) presenting the role of moral intuition and intuitive moral judgement (affect laden intuition), including emotion processing, underlying ethical decisions. Although factors (individual, organisational and societal) shaping cognition are often considered in academic literature the intuitive process including emotions is only occasionally included presenting an avenue for future research in progressing decision-making on sustainability and climate change. Gond et. al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2017</xref>), also identified the knowledge deficit relating to the role of affective processes and emotions in engagement with CSR, further supporting continued research in this area.
