<p id="Par130">Decisions made by managers on issues and investments linked to climate change have been broken down into foundational factors and cognitive processes within this review, with components linked through a dynamic and interactive process. Commencing with foundational factors, individual, organisational or societal in nature, the model presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, illustrates the influence of experience and an individual’s background on cognitive processes related to climate change. These processes, represented as an interconnection between cognition, cognitive framing, sensemaking and interpretation (discussed further below) have been reported to shape each other determining the eventual managerial decision, the outcomes of which may either be behavioural or cognitive, either facilitating or inhibiting further action on climate change (demonstrated in the model through dashed feedback lines). These feedback loops are supported by the references to temporal and spatial aspects impacting an individual’s cognitive process (Haider &amp; Mariotti, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2016</xref>; Plewnia &amp; Guentha, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2018</xref>). We now discuss each model component further before raising issues that may be leading to a lack of action, identifying intervention points and potential tipping point characteristics.
