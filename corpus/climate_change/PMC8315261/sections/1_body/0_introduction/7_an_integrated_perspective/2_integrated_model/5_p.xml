<p id="Par136">Unpacking the role of each cognitive process in decision-making can be challenging. From the systematic review we can see the concept of cognition underpins all aspects of the process, cognitive framing shapes sensemaking and ultimately interpretation, which is followed by a process of decision and sensegiving. An example from the authors professional experience is provided below to demonstrate the interactions and evolution within the cognitive process. The case is of a manager within an electricity utility. Where a manager has experience in the realities of managing carbon emissions within its organisational environment, experienced exposure to market trends and opportunities to purchase the credits from or work with developers of large-scale renewable generation assets, they will have an existing cognitive frame which they will apply when exploring another similar opportunity. This cognition and frame will assist them in knowing where to scan for information, make sense of it, interpret the option, and eventually decide whether or not to act. As decisions such as this are not made in isolation the process will also involve sensegiving prior to action. The outcome of this process will evolve the individual’s cognition and initial cognitive frame on the issue. The evolved frame will then shape the individual’s future strategic choices.</p>
