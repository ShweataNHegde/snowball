 <italic>Factor Foundation:</italic> The factors shaping an individual’s cognitive process are linked to the individual themselves, through their inherited traits and their lives to date; their organisational environment; and, the society in which they live. Each area is represented as overlapping within the model, to demonstrate the interconnection and influence of factors on one another, for example societal norms will shape both organisational and individual values.
