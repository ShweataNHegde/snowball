<p id="Par129">Although a theoretical link between knowledge, engagement and the commitment of managers on climate change with action, has been made by prior research (Furrer et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2012</xref>; León &amp; Arana, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2015</xref>; Linnenluecke et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2015</xref>; Okereke et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2012</xref>) a thorough examination of the state of research on the topic has been lacking to date. This article has set out to establish underlying reasons for managerial inaction on climate change despite a recognition of the seriousness of the issue and the imperative for action. An integrated, dynamic, multi-conceptual model will now be presented (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> below) synthesising the review results (summarised in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref> below) to identify interactions and potential intervention points. The concept of sensitive intervention points and tipping points has become recognised in natural and socioeconomic systems linked to climate change (Farmer et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2019</xref>; Lenton et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2019</xref>) and provides a lens through which to interpret our review results.
