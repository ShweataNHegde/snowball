 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) depicts FYMS´ characteristics. A total of n = 75 FYMS were invited to participate in the survey. Of these students, n = 65 (response rate: 87%) participated and all of them completed the questionnaire. Cronbach’s alpha for the 12-item questionnaire used in this study was 0.9, and sampling adequacy was high (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin = 0.8). Three eigenvalues were greater than 1, accounting for 69% of all variance. Factor 1 consisted of professional responsibility (five items; α = 0.9); factor 2 of expected consequences (four items; α = 0.9); factor 3 of individual responsibility (three items; α = 0.7). Items of the factor professional responsibility showed the lowest level of agreement (mean = 47.2, SD = 21.2), while the two other factors showed higher levels of agreement (expected consequences (mean = 75.6, SD = 18.4), individual responsibility (mean = 75.1, SD = 20.6)).
