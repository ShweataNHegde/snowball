<p>The one-way ANOVA with repeated measures was conducted to compare the mean sum scores of the three factors (expected consequences, individual responsibility, professional responsibility). There was a significant effect of factor, Wilks’ Lambda = 0.3, F [2,63] = 73.9, p &lt; .001, η
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.7. Pairwise comparisons using the Bonferroni correction showed that the mean scores for the three factors were statistically significantly different between factor 1 professional responsibility and factor 2 expected consequences (p &lt; .001), and factor 1 professional responsibility and factor 3 individual responsibility (p &lt; .001), but not between factor 2 expected consequences and factor 3 individual responsibility (p &gt; .05).
