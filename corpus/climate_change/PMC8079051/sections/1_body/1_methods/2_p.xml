 <bold>Context</bold>: In Germany, it is extremely competitive to apply for a degree course in medicine. A diploma from a German secondary school (‘Abitur’/A levels certificate) is required for matriculation. Only very good school-leaving certificates guarantee the student a direct start at the university. The earliest age for starting a degree course in medicine is usually 18 years (with a few exceptions), although a study published in 2019 (characterizing n = 3511 medical students) indicated that over one-third of students are 21 and older [

 <xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and is divided into three clinical rotations (internal medicine, surgery, and an elective), lasting 4 months each. These rotations can be served in any order. Hence, all FYMS must attend 16-week internships in internal medicine and surgery.
