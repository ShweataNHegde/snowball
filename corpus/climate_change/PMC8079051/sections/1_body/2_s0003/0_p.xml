 <bold>Procedure and data analysis:</bold> Data were analysed using the software package IBM SPSS Statistics 25 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). First, to describe characteristics of the study group (demographic data, such as age, sex, etc.), descriptive statistics, such as means, standard deviations, frequency counts, and percentage distributions, were generated. Second, to validate the structure of the developed questionnaire, we examined its component correlation. Therefore, we ran a factor analysis using oblique (promax) rotation in order to assign the items to the emerging factors. Then, we calculated Cronbachâ€™s alpha to measure internal consistency of the new scale. Within this step, only items with factor loadings greater than 0.4 were retained in the respective factor [

For the purpose of our main research question (i.e., are there differences among FYMS in the expected consequences vs. perceived individual responsibility vs. professional responsibility?), we conducted a one-way ANOVA with repeated measures to compare the mean scores in order to detect possible differences between these mean scores of the three emerging components (i.e., factors) within the study group (i.e., expected consequences, individual responsibility, professional responsibility). In post-hoc pairwise comparisons, the mean scores of the three factors were compared with each other and examined for differences (i.e., professional responsibility vs. individual responsibility; professional responsibility vs. expected consequences; individual responsibility vs. expected consequences). A p-value &lt;.05 (two-tailed) was considered statistically significant. To control the familywise error rate, post-hoc analyses (pairwise comparisons) were conducted using the Bonferroni correction.
