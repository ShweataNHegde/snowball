<p>We are not aware of any representative survey on the attitudes of (German) medical students, this new generation of potential educators, with regard to global climate change. Up to date there are only data on the attitudes of (American) physicians. A large majority of family medicine and community health physicians surveyed in an American study stated that they believe climate change is happening and 64% claimed they had witnessed climate change affecting their patientsâ€™ health.
