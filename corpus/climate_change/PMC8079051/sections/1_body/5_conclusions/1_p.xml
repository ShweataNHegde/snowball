<p>Young people in particular, i.e., those generations who will have to suffer the consequences of a warming world the longest, are taking an active part in raising awareness for climate change. Our study suggests that young people at a German university hospital (future doctors) recognize the threats and consequences connected to a global climate change and accept their individual responsibility as global citizens. However, the medical students seemed to be unsure of their professional responsibility, i.e., of the social role that the medical profession might play in tackling climate change. For the medical schools, there is a great opportunity to educate future doctors about the topic of climate change and health. We are hopeful that one day medical doctors will see themselves as ecological role models, especially since data from other researchers suggest that medical studentsâ€™ attitudes towards climate change are mutable.</p>
