 <xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] - cannot be answered by the present study. In a model that summarizes the results of this study and identifies further research needs we assume that some unknown factors seem to influence the development of this additional form of responsibility (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2</xref>). The question derived from this model, why some medical students develop professional responsibility in addition to the knowledge of the expected consequences and the feeling of individual responsibility, while this additional responsibility is not perceived by other FYMS, should be addressed in future studies.
