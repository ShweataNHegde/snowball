<p>This study was the first to assess FYMS’ understanding of the effects of global climate change on people’s health, the FYMS’ sense of personal responsibility regarding global climate change and finally, the FYMS’ opinion of a professional responsibility as a role model and educator regarding climate change. The questionnaire´s items of the factor professional responsibility showed the lowest level of agreement, while the two other factors (expected consequences and individual responsibility) showed higher levels of agreement. While the majority (mean &gt; 50) of FYMS agreed with their function as social role models as well as their function as role models for patients regarding climate change, fewer students (mean &lt; 50) recognized their social responsibility, educational role, and informational role regarding climate change. This reflects that although FYMS are aware of their important role as future physicians, they do not translate this responsibility into direct action, such as educating patients about the consequences of climate change and the impact on patients’ medical health. Nevertheless, we are hopeful that this next generation of doctors could play an active role in educating society about global climate change, as future doctors at Heidelberg University Hospital are generally well-informed about the expected health consequences of global climate change, recognize human contributions to climate change and make personal decisions to mitigate the impact.</p>
