<p>In summary, our results suggest that awareness of the consequences of global climate change and the recognition of our personal or individual responsibility could be prerequisites for the development of a professional sense of responsibility as doctors, but this additional level of responsibility is often not perceived by medical students. Several limitations exist in this study. The sample consists of German FYMS from a single university and therefore cannot be considered representative. While the gender ratio in our study is not atypical of the situation in final year medical education at Heidelberg University Hospital, it does not represent the general gender distribution in medical school. It is also important to point out that the study only gives an impression of the students’ reflections on climate change and their role in this context, and the results cannot be generalized. Although the response rate was high (87%), it is still possible that those who completed the survey had a higher interest in the subject matter. Despite the anonymous processing of the questionnaire, it cannot be ruled out that individual subjects felt a sense of obligation towards the researchers or felt the urge to behave politically correctly. Finally, it should not go unmentioned that the questionnaire used is not yet established – it was developed especially for this study.</p>
