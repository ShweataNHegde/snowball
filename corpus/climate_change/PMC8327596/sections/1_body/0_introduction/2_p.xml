Among the legal questions involved, there is an event attribution question at the heart of the case. Climate scientist Kevin Trenberth gave testimony using the causal, conditional, “storyline” attribution method (Shepherd

The US Government used integrated assessment modeler John Weyant to rebut Trenberth’s analyses, essentially arguing that a fully quantitative modeling chain down to the scale of the specific harm, including the human-managed element, was necessary to establish causation.
