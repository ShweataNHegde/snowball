<p id="Par2">Increasingly, claims concerning damage from anthropogenic climate change are reaching the courts, where they fall under tort law (Marjanac and Patton 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2018</xref>; Burger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2020</xref>). At the heart of liability under tort law is the concept of causality, for which expert testimony is crucial (Cranor 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2005</xref>). Climate-related damage generally arises from extreme weather and climate events, whose causality is the subject of what is called extreme event attribution (NAS 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2016</xref>). The question thus arises of how the science of extreme event attribution can be used to establish the causality of climate-event-related harms within the specific context of tort law.
