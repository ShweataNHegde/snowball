<p id="Par6">Weyant’s demand for an attribution study 
 <italic>of a matching geographic and temporal scope</italic>, down to the scale of a specific ski resort or road or cabin, is clearly going to be difficult to achieve. Moreover, as Hulme et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2011</xref>) have argued, the connection between hazard (the weather or climate event) and impact or harm is “always mediated through complex political, social, and economic structures”, which would need to be considered in any assessment of liability (Lusk 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2017</xref>). Thus, the question posed by Burger et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2020</xref>) is whether, given the challenges of performing such a detailed study in a comprehensive way, it is nevertheless possible to reason from the general to the specific, taking account of the specificity in a contingent, conditional manner. Were this possibility to be excluded, it would largely preclude the use of tort law to address climate damage from individual extreme events. Because 
 <italic>Juliana</italic> has now been dismissed on unrelated (standing and justiciability) grounds (see Burger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2020</xref>, section III.C.1.b.vi), the question has yet to be tested in court, but clearly has implications beyond the specific case of 
 <italic>Juliana</italic>. The purpose of this article is to review the basic principles of tort law, and assess how the science of extreme event attribution can be aligned with those principles. Our target audience is attribution scientists, as well as those working in the space between climate science and tort law. We do not address questions of standing and justiciability, which will depend on the specific legal context of the claim.
