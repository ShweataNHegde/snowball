  <p id="Par17">e. Dr. Trenberth states: “Plaintiff Nathan has experienced thawing permafrost and wildfires around his home in Fairbanks, Alaska, especially in 2015. Thawing permafrost is uneven and more likely on sunlight (sic) slopes, and has led to tilted and broken buildings and frost heaves in roads. Wildfires were widespread in Alaska in the summer of 2015. These harms are made worse by human-induced climate change.” As with his other examples, Dr. Trenberth does not address any 
   <italic>confounding factors</italic> that might have contributed to the specific weather outcomes in Alaska in 2015, 
   <italic>the analysis of which is essential to reach a scientifically valid conclusion about any causal role</italic> played by human-induced climate change on plaintiff Nathan. (emphasis added)
