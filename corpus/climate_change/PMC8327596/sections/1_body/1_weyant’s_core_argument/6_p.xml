<p id="Par14">It turns out this “logical leap” consists in the standard logical inference of 
 <italic>taking an instance from a generalization</italic>: that is, Trenberth taking a general statement, generalizing over many individual cases, about a phenomenon applying to an area of the world, or a season, or a pattern of the physical world, and then picking out 
 <italic>one</italic> of those cases as an example or instance of that phenomenon, which Weyant describes as an illegitimate “leap” of logic. Not even in formal logic is this deductive inference illegitimate. It is like considering a basket of red apples, taking one out of the basket without looking at it, and saying that we have a red apple. This is not fancy logic.
