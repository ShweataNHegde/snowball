  <p id="Par9">The reports of Plaintiffs’ experts Dr. Trenberth and Prof. Running do not and cannot reliably tie global climate change due to the Defendants’ conduct at issue to the claimed injuries they allege affected Plaintiffs . . .because the current state of our scientific understanding is not sufficiently developed. This is because: These climate and climate impact models generally cannot determine the regional effects of global climate change to the degree of specificity necessary to causally link to specific weather events, let alone to individuals and any claimed injuries.</p>
