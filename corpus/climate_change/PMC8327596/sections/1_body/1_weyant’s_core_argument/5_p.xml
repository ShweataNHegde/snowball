<p id="Par13">Weyant specifically critiqued climate scientist Kevin Trenberth’s detailing of the causes of the damage suffered by the plaintiffs in his testimony for the defense. Trenberth had used the “storyline” approach to attribution, taking the region-specific factors as contingent and assessing the role of climate change conditional on those factors. Weyant has a provocative section title in his testimony: “C. Unsupported Logical Leap of Dr. Trenberth’s Analysis”, which is followed by a claim that Trenberth had failed to make his case for the plaintiffs. Specifically, “The analytical support that Dr. Trenberth provides for each Plaintiff varies, but all his conclusions of the injuries to Plaintiffs suffer from the same failure to 
 <italic>connect his conditional approach conclusions to Plaintiffs’ local circumstances</italic>.” (emphasis added).
