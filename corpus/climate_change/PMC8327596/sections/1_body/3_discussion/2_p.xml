<p id="Par38">The principle of considering the totality of the evidence implies that in a tort law context, evidence from both the probabilistic and the more singular storyline approach to extreme event attribution should be considered, and furthermore should be set within the context of physical understanding of climate change, since the latter fundamentally underpins the reliability of extreme event attribution (NAS 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2016</xref>). In other words, any particular line of evidence should not be considered in isolation. The probabilistic and storyline approaches are highly complementary in terms of their strengths and weaknesses. For example, the probabilistic approach can consider alternative aspects of climate change not considered in the storyline approach, providing an overall statistical context, and sometimes establishing “but for” causation. On the other hand, it is challenging to connect the probabilistic approach to impacts, because extreme hazard does not necessarily correspond to extreme impact (van der Wiel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2020</xref>), although this issue can perhaps be mitigated to some extent if the case involves an aggregated set of impacts (Frame et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>). If the probabilistic approach suggests that the known thermodynamic aspects of change are the main drivers of change in hazard (as is often the case), then the storyline approach could be used to more reliably quantify impacts and harm, since it does not need to blur over what might be essential details of the event in order to create a sample population for the probability estimates. In this way, the storyline approach can establish deterministic “but for” causation, albeit in a conditional manner.
