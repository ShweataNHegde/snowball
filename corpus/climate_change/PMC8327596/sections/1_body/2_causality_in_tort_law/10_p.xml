<p id="Par35">The first factor on the right-hand side is a ratio of conditional probabilities, representing the change in probability of the hazard 
 <italic>for the given dynamical conditions</italic>. Its calculation corresponds to the conditional, storyline approach discussed earlier, which quantifies what may be considered the thermodynamic aspects of change, for which there is high confidence. It can be calculated in a variety of ways, e.g., through a conditional statistical analysis (Cattiaux et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2010</xref>) or by constraining a climate model (van Garderen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2021</xref>). Such a calculation is most naturally expressed in terms of the magnitude of the effect of climate change, and can be directly compared with the magnitude of the natural variability.
