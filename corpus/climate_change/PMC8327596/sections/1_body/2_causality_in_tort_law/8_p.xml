<p id="Par33">The reference to “confounding factors” reflects the fact that Cranor (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2005</xref>) is mainly considering the case of toxic substances, where the physical understanding of the causal linkages is generally quite weak and correlational evidence (which can be prone to the influence of confounding factors) is thus crucial. As mentioned earlier, in the case of climate impacts that are closely tied to robust consequences of global warming, the causal chain is based on physical knowledge and the reasoning is more deductive than inductive. Hence, the concept of a confounding factor is not relevant, and the issue is instead that of mediating or contributing factors. The role of non-meteorological factors has already been discussed under the third step, so we focus here on the alternative climate explanations of the hazard that led to the climate impact. In any extreme event, there is invariably a significant role played by unusual dynamical conditions, e.g., a blocking anticyclone for a heat wave. Thus, the traditional way (NAS 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2016</xref>) to quantify the change in probability of a hazard due to climate change (exactly what is needed in the third step) is by the risk ratio 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>f</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>H</italic>, 
 <italic>D</italic>)/
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>c</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>H</italic>, 
 <italic>D</italic>), where 
 <italic>P</italic> is the probability, 
 <italic>H</italic> is the hazard, 
 <italic>D</italic> is the dynamical condition that is conducive to that hazard, and the subscripts 
 <italic>f</italic> and 
 <italic>c</italic>, respectively, denote the factual conditions (with climate change) and the counterfactual conditions (without climate change). The relative roles of climate change and natural variability, or chance, are captured in the risk ratio. This calculation can sometimes be done from observations alone (using the past as a proxy for the counterfactual), but is generally done with a climate model (NAS 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2016</xref>; Stott et al.
