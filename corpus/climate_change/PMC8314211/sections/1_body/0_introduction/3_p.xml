<p>Historical samples can also inform long-standing debates in evolutionary biology, such as whether adaptation is limited by the supply of mutations (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Karasov et al., 2010</xref>) or whether migration can facilitate adaptation (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Pennings and Hermisson, 2006</xref>). With historical samples, it would be possible to watch the sweep of beneficial mutations in action. If adaptation is limited by mutations, then we would expect swept alleles to be rare before they sweep through the population (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Feder et al., 2021</xref>). If multiple populations are sampled, then you could ask whether alleles that sweep through one population were already present in other populations. Both of these questions are essential to understanding the impact that climate change will have on species, and can be useful for designing conservation strategies (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Matz et al., 2018</xref>) or predicting speciesâ€™ responses to climate change (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Fuller et al., 2020</xref>).
