<p>Variation in environmental conditions across space can result in local adaptation, where populations are more fit to the environment in which they evolved (

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Diffenbaugh et al., 2018</xref>), populations will need to migrate to more favorable climates, modify their phenotypes via plasticity or evolutionary change, or face extinction (
