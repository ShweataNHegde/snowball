<p>A promising way to understand climate adaptation lies in the use of historical samples. Given the historical nature of the evolutionary process, samples from multiple timepoints can help better identify the targets of selection. Combined with recent advances in sequencing technologies, it is now possible to compare entire genomes of present and past populations (

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Alves et al. (2019)</xref> used modern and historical rabbit specimens to identify the genetic basis of resistance to myxoma virus, which decimated rabbit populations in the 1950s. Likewise,
