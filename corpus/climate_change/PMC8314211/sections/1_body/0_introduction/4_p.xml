<p>Although these advances present exciting opportunities to understand local climate adaptation and better predict responses to climate change, there are important challenges in obtaining and interpreting historical genomic datasets. First, it is critical to discern between genetic adaptation and phenotypic plasticity. Second, it remains difficult to map genotype, phenotype, and fitness. Third, it is hard to disentangle the role of adaptive and demographic processes in shaping genetic variation. In this perspective article, we discuss these challenges and argue that classical model organisms, such as 
 <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, are uniquely suited to overcome most of these difficulties.
