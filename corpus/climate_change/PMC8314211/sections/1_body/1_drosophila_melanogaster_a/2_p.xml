 <italic>Drosophila</italic> is an amenable model to study genetics of climate adaptation not only because of its peculiar colonization history. Species in this group have short generation times and can be easily reared in the laboratory. This allows for experimental validation; for instance, one can measure fitness of flies from different populations under various conditions to directly test selection hypotheses (

 <italic>Drosophila</italic> is a remarkably diverse group, with almost unparalleled genomic resources (e.g., 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2020</xref>), and so comparative genomics studies are within reach. For instance, by comparing 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and 
 <italic>Drosophila simulans</italic>, 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Machado et al. (2016)</xref> found that the ability to overwinter is necessary for adapting to temperate environments.
