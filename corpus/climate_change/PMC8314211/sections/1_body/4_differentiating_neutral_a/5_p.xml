<p>The stability of trait–environment correlations, which is a hallmark of local adaptation, can also be assessed with historical samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). In the short term, stable correlations are strong evidence for natural selection (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Cogni et al., 2014</xref>), because spurious correlations due to demography are expected to be transient. However, as populations respond to changing climate conditions, we expect the underlying trait–environment correlations to change as well. Depending on how climate change affects fitness, clines can become less steep, with flies from high latitudes becoming more similar to flies from low latitudes or shift entirely so that the frequency of the warm adapted allele increases across the entire range. In the case of 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, it would be interesting to quantify the effect of climate change on local adaptation by looking specifically at loci that are known to be relevant to climate adaptation, such as the inversion 3R Payne or the loci underlying diapause and metabolism (

 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Lavington et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Siddiq and Thornton, 2019</xref>). Have clines at these loci weakened or shifted in the past 50 years?
