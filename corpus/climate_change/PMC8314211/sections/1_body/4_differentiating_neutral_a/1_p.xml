<p>The final challenge is that inferring the role of selection in shaping genetic variation in natural populations is not trivial. If selection is pushing traits to different optima across space, the loci underlying the selected traits should be excessively differentiated between populations (

Although these features of genomic data are indicative of local adaptation, the evidence is correlative in nature and may be confounded by non-adaptive processes. For example, demographic processes alone can create correlations between allele frequencies and the environment (
