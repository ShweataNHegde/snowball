<p>In 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, these challenges can be overcome in a few ways. New panels with much larger number of recombinant inbred lines can substantially increase the power of GWAS studies to identify minor effect alleles and epistatic interactions (

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Cogni et al., 2016</xref>). Further, there exist diverse collections of wild-caught flies, which can be used in mapping and experimental evolution studies (

 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Lack et al., 2016</xref>). By harnessing the immense natural variation in 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, mapping power can be greatly increased (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Gasch et al., 2016</xref>). The system also allows for laboratory experiments under different environmental conditions, and genotype-by-environment interactions can be directly measured (e.g.,
