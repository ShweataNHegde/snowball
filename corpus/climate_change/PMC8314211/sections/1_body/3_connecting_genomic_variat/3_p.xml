<p>An alternative to the major challenges in genotype-to-phenotype mapping would be to rely on already known instances of climate adaptation in 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. Genome-wide patterns of clinal, altitudinal, and seasonal adaptation have been well characterized in the system, so we can make clear predictions on the shifts in allele frequencies expected by climate change, even without linking genotypes to particular phenotypes. Alleles with higher frequency in warm regions are expected to increase in frequency as the climate becomes warmer over time (
