<p>In 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic>, plasticity and adaptation can be distinguished with two different approaches. First, lineages from divergent populations can be reared in the laboratory under similar environmental conditions. Plastic phenotype responses are expected to disappear when divergent populations are reared in the same conditions, whereas genetic adaptations should persist (

 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Garland and Kelly, 2006</xref>). With these experiments, it is possible to exert selection on a single environmental condition (e.g., temperature) and measure responses at the phenotypic and genomic levels (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Barghi et al., 2019</xref>). Then, the adapted lineages can be reared under different conditions to tease apart the role of phenotypic plasticity. Climate adaptation can be complex, making it difficult to be addressed in laboratory settings which are known to have many subtle environmental differences. However, recent 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> studies have shown that flies can be raised in outdoor cages, under conditions which are remarkably similar to those which natural wild populations experience (
