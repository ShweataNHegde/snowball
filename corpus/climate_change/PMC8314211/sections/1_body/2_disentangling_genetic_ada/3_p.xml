<p>Second, genetic adaptation can be disentangled from phenotypic plasticity by studying changes at the molecular level, that is with direct observation of allele frequency changes in natural populations. For example, 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Umina et al. (2005)</xref> observed a shift over 20 years in a classic 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> latitudinal cline in the alcohol dehydrogenase polymorphism. The frequency of the warmer-adapted allele increased in frequency along the cline, presumably in response to warmer and drier conditions. There are also examples in other 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> species of changes in chromosome inversion frequencies correlated with climate warming (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Balanya et al., 2006</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Batista et al., 2012</xref>). These direct observations of genetic changes can refute the phenotypic plasticity hypotheses. However, it is not clear if the observed shifts reflected changes in local selection, a progressive invasion of warm-adapted genotypes from lower latitudes/altitudes, or a combination of both (
