 <p>S.R. wrote the manuscript with input from all co-authors. S.R. and T.A.D. conceived the study, and respectively coordinated and synthesised data from the marine and lake studies. A.L. generated the diatom and biomarker data and prepared the figures together with S.R., R.J., T.A.D. and W.C. G.M., J.G. and X.C. provided the marine sediment core material, and contributed with laboratory analyses. S.R., A.L., G.M., J.G., X.C., K.W., E.G., N.M., A.K. and S.M.O. all contributed to the interpretation of the marine data. T.J.A. generated the 
  <sup>210</sup>Pb/
  <sup>137</sup>Cs data and geochronology. S.M.O. provided oceanographic context to the interpretations. W.C. and T.A.D. performed the statistical analyses. J.O. and A.S. conducted the 
  <sup>14</sup>C dating, J.S. contributed isotope data, A.C.G.H., H.M. and S.T. generated the sterol data, N.K.L. oversaw the XRF data, K.L.J. and A.M. initiated the seabird aspects of the wider project and K.L.J. commented extensively on the manuscript. S.W. contributed and synthesised data on the landscape development of the lake site. E.J., B.G. and M.N. contributed with expert knowledge on the local ecology (E.J.), archaeology (B.G.) and anthropology (M.N). All co-authors commented on the manuscript and approve its content.
