   <bold>a</bold> A stable and highly productive polynya is inferred from our records after 4400–4200 cal yrs b2k, coincident with the arrival of the first humans in Greenland and the first appearance and expansion of little auks in the area. 
   <bold>b</bold> From 2700 to 800 cal yrs b2k, the polynya is unstable and reduced in extent, particularly after 2200 cal yrs b2k. This period spans a void in the human settlement of Greenland from 
   <bold>c</bold>. 2200–1200 yrs b2k and absence/low abundance of little auks. 
   <bold>c</bold> From c. 800 cal yrs b2k, a stable but low productive polynya is inferred and little auk colonies recover. During this time, there is a replacement of Late Dorset groups by the Thule Culture, the direct ancestors of modern Inuit.
