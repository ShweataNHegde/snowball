  <title>Trends in atmospheric and sea ice conditions in the North Water region since the mid-twentieth century.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>a</bold> Anomaly map showing the difference in May–September sea ice concentration following the extreme AO + anomaly year of 1989 compared to the extreme AO-anomaly year of 1996 and location of the weather station at Pituffik (Thule Air Base). Extreme AO + conditions resulted in 5% sea-ice cover reduction in the ice arch area and an increase in drift ice in the polynya area compared to AO- conditions. 
   <bold>b</bold> Air temperature anomaly for May–September at Pituffik. 
   <bold>c</bold> Winter AO index. 
   <bold>d</bold>. Average sea ice concentrations during May–September for the two regions of interest based on satellite observations (see Methods for details); 
   <bold>e</bold>, 
   <bold>f</bold> Fluxes of the sea ice biomarkers IP
   <sub>25</sub> and HBI III, respectively, in the box-core marine sediment record. The grey bar denotes a regime shift in sea ice (declining %) and air temperatures (positive anomalies) after 1998.
