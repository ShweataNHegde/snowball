<p id="Par8">The marine sediment record consists of a gravity (543 cm long) and a box core (40 cm long) retrieved from a site centrally located in Smith Sound at 692 m water depth, south of the southernmost ice arch location (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, see ‘Methods’ for details). The combined record shows continuous marine sedimentation spanning the past ca. 4000 years, with sedimentation rates varying from 0.09 to 0.27 cm y
 <sup>−1</sup> in the gravity core and 0.4–0.67 cm y
 <sup>−1</sup> in the box core, and total organic carbon contents ranging 1.5–2% (Fig.
