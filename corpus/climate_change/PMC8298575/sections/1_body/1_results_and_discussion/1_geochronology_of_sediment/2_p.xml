<p id="Par9">The lacustrine sediment core (177 cm long) was retrieved from a lake at Annikitsoq on the Cape York Peninsula at 34 m water depth and spans the last ca. 6000 years (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The lake currently lies about 1 km from the edge of the Greenland Ice Sheet and receives some inflow from streams originating there (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16</xref>). As such, there is an input of water with lower nutrient contents and lower δ
 <sup>15</sup>N values than the inflow from the large little auk colony located right beside and above the lake. This lake is currently profoundly impacted by the birds with a pH of 5 and Chlorophyll-a concentration of 22.7 µg l
 <sup>−1</sup>, low and high respectively for a High Arctic lake. The lake sediment core is marked by a sharp transition at 150 cm, which dates to 4400–4200 cal yrs b2k (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Sediment characteristics at the base of the core reflect the local geology

 </sup>, which comprises high-grade crystalline rocks (Kap York Meta-igneous Complex) with glacial silty-clays and low organic content (Loss on Ignition 20%, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). After the transition, there is a 4-fold increase in sediment accumulation rates, the colour changes markedly, and organic contents become extremely high for a high Arctic lake (up to 80%) (Fig.
