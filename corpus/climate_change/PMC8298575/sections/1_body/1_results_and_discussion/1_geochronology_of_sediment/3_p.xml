<p id="Par10">Diatom analyses of the lake record, supported by XRF elemental data, provide independent evidence that the sediment record covers a period of continuous freshwater sedimentation (Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Prior to the transition at c. 4200 cal yrs b2k, the lake diatom assemblages were dominated by Fragilarioid species (
 <italic>Staurosira construens</italic> and 
 <italic>Stauroforma exiguiformis</italic>). Fragilarioids are common in Arctic lakes and ponds and are typically found in oligotrophic and circum-neutral to somewhat alkaline environments with prolonged ice cover and hence a short growing season

 </sup>. After 4200 cal yrs b2k, there is a marked change in the lake diatom assemblages indicating a decrease in lake pH, which is seen as the dominance of acidophilous taxa (within the genera 
 <italic>Psammothidium</italic> and 
 <italic>Eunotia</italic>) and an overall decrease in planktic species, which are adversely affected by lower pH

 </sup> (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). The acidification of the lake is a result of the marked peat accumulation in the catchment area after the arrival of little auk (see also ‘Methods’). The lake diatom assemblages show no clear signs of eutrophication despite the increased supply of marine-derived nutrients by the birds, which is likely due to the overriding effect of acidification on species composition.
