<p id="Par11">The lake indicators record the arrival of little auks at the colony site between 4400 and 4200 cal yrs b2k (Fig.

 </sup>. Bird colony influence on the lake appears to be relatively stable from c. 4200 and 2700 cal yrs b2k (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The high diatom fluxes in the marine record indicate a productive polynya that would support bird colony expansion during this interval (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The high IP
 <sub>25</sub> fluxes demonstrate an active polynya with the recurrent formation of seasonal sea ice, while the minimal HBI III fluxes indicate reduced influence of marginal ice conditions at the core site (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Combined, the diatom and sea-ice biomarker records indicate prolonged open-water conditions consistent with an active and stable polynya. The arrival of little auk is coeval with the earliest documented human migrations into Greenland.
