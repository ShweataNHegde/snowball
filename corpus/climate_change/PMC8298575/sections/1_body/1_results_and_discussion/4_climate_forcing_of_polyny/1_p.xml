<p id="Par16">Polynya dynamics in the North Water are strongly linked to sea ice conditions (sea ice thickness, concentration and motion) and prevailing winds, and thus influenced by local and regional climate forcing. The inception of recurrent ice arches in the Nares Strait region is estimated to have occurred at the mid-to-late Holocene transition, following atmospheric cooling and extensive sea ice formation in the Canadian Arctic and Greenland

 </sup>. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Arctic Oscillation (AO) are the two dominant (and closely related) modes of atmospheric variability for the mid-latitudes of the North Atlantic region and the entire Northern Hemisphere, respectively

 </sup>. The NAO/AO have shown periodicities on multidecadal timescales that are linked with sea-surface temperature changes in the North Atlantic (Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV)), in turn influencing Arctic sea-ice variability

 </sup>. Sea ice concentration and motion in the Arctic Ocean region are also highly impacted by the Dipole Anomaly (DA) pattern—the second mode of winter variability - which promotes sea ice transport from the western to the eastern Arctic Ocean and export towards the North Atlantic through Fram Strait, and appears to be particularly important during warmer periods
