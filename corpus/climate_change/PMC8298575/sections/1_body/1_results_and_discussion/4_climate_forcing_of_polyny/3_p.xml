<p id="Par18">Predominantly positive modes of the AO (and NAO) are inferred for the period of human abandonment of Greenland c. 2200–1200 cal yrs b2k and coeval with our demonstrated decline in NOW productivity (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Several episodes of strong positive Arctic Oscillation (AO) anomalies of magnitudes unprecedented in the Holocene are indicated by Kara Sea-sourced ice-rafted iron grains preserved in sediment cores from the Alaskan coast (ref.

 </sup>. Such conditions can have a negative impact on ice arch formation and stability, and lead to an increase in sea ice drift in the NOW region, as demonstrated by satellite data (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). While the AO affects sea ice conditions in the NOW, the Dipole Anomaly has been determinant in promoting sea ice loss from the Arctic Ocean via the Transpolar Drift system in recent decades

 </sup>. This partly explains why negative AO excursions in recent years have also led to record low Arctic sea ice volumes, contributing to amplifying ice loss and warming in the region (ref.
