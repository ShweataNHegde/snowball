 </sup> The period of polynya instability spans two warm(er) intervals, the Roman Warm Period and the Medieval Climate Anomaly. Marine records from offshore Greenland indicate ocean warming, particularly during the Roman Warm Period (c. 2000–1600 cal yrs b2k), linked to an increased contribution of Atlantic-sourced waters to the West Greenland Current
