The unprecedented speed of the changes already underway should provide an impetus to ensure that climate change does not outpace the adaptive capacity and threaten the anticipatory knowledge of High Arctic Inuit communities, who are also facing social and economic challenges. This is a priority highlighted by the Inuit Circumpolar Council’s Pikialasorsuaq Commission, which recommends that the governments of Greenland and Canada support ecosystem monitoring and conservation of living resources, and work with indigenous organisations and local communities to implement a management regime for the polynya, and the creation of an Indigenous Protected Area (IPA)
