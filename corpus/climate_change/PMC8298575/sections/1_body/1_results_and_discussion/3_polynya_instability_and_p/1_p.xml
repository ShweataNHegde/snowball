<p id="Par13">During c. 2700–2200 cal yrs b2k, the lake record indicates a significant decline in the abundance of little auks, culminating in a short-lived abandonment of the colony c. 2300 cal yrs b2k (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>f–i). This decline is marked by falling δ
 <sup>15</sup>N and cholesterol values, and a reduction of moderately to strongly acidophilous diatom species (

 </sup> (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). In the marine record, primary production remains high until c. 2200 cal yrs b2k after when it drops significantly (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The fact that the lake record indicators show an earlier decline than the marine record indicators, is presumably linked to the different locations of coring sites relative to the spatial extent of the polynya. The marine coring site lies at the centre of the polynya, whereas the lake site is located close to its present-day southern edge, and therefore any polynya contractions would be recorded somewhat earlier at this location (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Although dating uncertainties cannot be ruled out as an alternative explanation, this idea is supported by peat core studies from further north, demonstrating that bird colonies spread northwards around 2800 and 2200 cal yrs b2K
