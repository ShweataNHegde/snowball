<p id="Par6">Due to its resource richness in one of Earth’s most inhospitable environments, and its strategic location at the southern edge of the narrowest point between Canada and Greenland, the NOW region represents the gateway of prehistoric migrations into Greenland and has been the stage for cultural transitions since the first humans crossed the Nares Strait c. 4400 yrs b2k

 </sup>. Ice-arch dynamics in Nares Strait have shown a tendency towards instability and earlier spring collapses, linked to changes in sea-ice regime and wind forcing

 </sup>. This raises concerns as to whether the NOW ecosystem will persevere in a warming climate. Evaluating risks and defining climate adaptation measures for this unique ecosystem requires an understanding of past ecological and societal responses, but this knowledge is lacking due to a paucity of long-term records.
