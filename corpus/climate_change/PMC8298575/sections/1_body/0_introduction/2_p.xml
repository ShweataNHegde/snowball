<p id="Par4">The seasonal formation and physical conditions of the NOW rely primarily on the consolidation of an ice arch or bridge across the southern Kane Basin during winter, which blocks the inflow of multiyear sea ice from the Arctic Ocean (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). When the ice arch is stable, newly formed sea ice south of the arch is continuously removed by northerly winds and ocean currents, which also promotes a deep mixed layer during winter and high nutrient availability for the spring phytoplankton bloom

 </sup> Entrainment of deeper and warmer Atlantic-derived water masses further limits sea ice growth and provides nutrients that sustain high primary productivity rates

 </sup>. Diatoms, including open-water, marginal ice zone, and sea-ice (sympagic) taxa, are the main primary producers in the NOW (e.g. ref. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>
 </sup>) and although grazing pressure may vary, a significant fraction of the diatom production in the euphotic zone reaches the seafloor sediments either as intact cells and spores or empty frustules (after grazing or lysis)

 </sup>. Following nutrient exhaustion, species belonging to the diatom genus
