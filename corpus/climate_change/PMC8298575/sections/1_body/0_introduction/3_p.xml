<p id="Par5">The NOW supports &gt;80% of the global breeding population of little auk, which is the most abundant seabird in the North Atlantic

 <italic>Calanus hyperboreus</italic>, on which the chicks are raised, and &gt;60 million birds depend on the unique availability of this prey item in the NOW

 </sup>. By transporting vast quantities of marine-derived nutrients (MDN) from sea to land in the form of guano, little auks have transformed extensive parts of the NOW coastal landscapes into green oases

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup>. At little auk colonies, temporal changes in the MDN flux in sediments can be used as a proxy for changes in bird numbers and, by inference, NOW productivity over time
