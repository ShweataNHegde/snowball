<p id="Par3">The impact of changing sea-ice conditions on the productivity of resources that sustain Indigenous livelihoods in the Arctic has been identified by the IPCC as an emerging climate change risk, stemming from the triangular-intersection of an exposure, a hazard and a vulnerability
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>
 </sup> In this context, the well-documented millennial-scale dependence of local communities on the North Water (NOW) represents an exposure
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
 </sup>, defined by the IPCC as the presence of e.g. people, livelihoods or ecosystems in settings that could be adversely affected

 </sup> The NOW or Pikialasorsuaq (‘the great upwelling’ in Greenlandic) is the largest and most productive polynya in the northern hemisphere, an annually recurring ice-free area in northern Baffin Bay (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The ice-free waters of the NOW allow for an enhanced and unusually early phytoplankton bloom lasting for two-four months
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup> The polynya ecosystem sustains keystone Arctic species, including Arctic cod, seabirds, and marine mammals such as narwhal, beluga, walrus, and polar bear

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
 </sup>, which all serve to underpin the hunting and fishing economies of Inuit communities in the region

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>
 </sup> The World Conservation Union (IUCN) has identified the NOW as one of the most ecologically significant marine areas in the Arctic and proposed it as a UNESCO Natural Marine World Heritage Site due to its Outstanding Universal Value
