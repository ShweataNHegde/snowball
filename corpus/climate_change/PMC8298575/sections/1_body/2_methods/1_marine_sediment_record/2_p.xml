<p id="Par23">Computed Tomography (CT) scanning of the core was performed using a Siemens SOMATOM Definition AS + 128 at the Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique (INRS), Quebec, Canada. The tomograms were converted into digital DICOM format using a standard Hounsfield scale (HU scale) from −1024 to 3071, where −1024 corresponds to the density of air, 0 to the density of water and 2500 to the density of calcite.</p>
