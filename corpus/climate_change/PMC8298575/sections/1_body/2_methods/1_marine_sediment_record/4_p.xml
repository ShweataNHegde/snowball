<p id="Par25">TOC measurements were carried out at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, at 5 cm intervals in the CASQ core and at 2 cm intervals in the box-core. Dried sediment samples (~0.5 g) were powdered (&lt;250 micron) and subjected to Rock-Eval type bulk flow pyrolysis using a HAWK instrument (Wildcat Technologies, Texas). Sets of one control-standard (in-house standard) and one blank were run every 10 samples to ensure instrument stability.</p>
