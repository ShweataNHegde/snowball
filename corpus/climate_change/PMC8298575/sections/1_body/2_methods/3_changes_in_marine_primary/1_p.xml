<p id="Par28">Diatom fluxes were used to infer changes in marine primary production. For diatom quantification, sediment samples were treated with hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, 30%) and hydrochloric acid (HCl, 10%) to remove the organic material and carbonate, respectively. Residues were then rinsed several times with distilled water. A known volume of the final residue, homogenised in suspension, was added to a coverslip. Once the samples were completely dried, microscopy slides were mounted in Naphrax® for observation. Quantification of diatom valves was done using an optical microscope (Olympus BX43) with phase contrast optics at a magnification of 1000x. Concentrations were calculated based on the surface area of the slide that was analysed. Fluxes were calculated by combining diatom concentrations (ind. g
 <sup>−1</sup>) with mass accumulation rates (g cm
 <sup>−2</sup> yr
 <sup>−1</sup>).
