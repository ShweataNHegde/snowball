<p id="Par33">The lake sediment core was split along its length then placed in an ITRAX core scanner to obtain high-resolution pictures and measure micro-XRF. The XRF scans were made at the Aarhus University core scanning facility with a molybdenum tube set at 30 kV and 30 mA with a dwell time of 4 s. Prior to analysis, the sediment surface was flattened and covered with a 4 µm ultralene film. A step size of 0.1 mm was selected to capture possible elemental variations even in small laminations. Count readings for less abundant elements, such as Ti, maybe too low with a 4 s dwell time, so counts were summed to at least 1 mm for analysis and presentation.</p>
