<p id="Par31">The age control of NOW25c was attained by 10 accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dates at Aarhus AMS Centre (AARAMS), Aarhus University, 9 on terrestrial moss remains and 1 on humic extraction of a bulk sample (Supplementary TableÂ 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The radiocarbon ages of the samples were converted into calendar years using the IntCal13 calibration curve
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>
 </sup>. The age model was calculated using the R routine BACON
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>
