<p id="Par29">Sediment core NOW25c was collected from a lake at Annikitsoq on the Cape York Peninsula (76°2.100′ N, 67°36.540 W, 8.1 m a.s.l.) on July 30th 2015. The sediment core was recovered from 34 m water depth using a highly portable piston corer specially adapted for remote location use. The 177cm-long core was kept upright and drained of water, the sediment surface was secured by packing the core top with a rigid foam block (Oasis), and the core was kept cool and dark before and during transport from Greenland to Denmark. Fieldwork was conducted in accordance with local laws and permits. Sediment material is deposited at Aarhus University and available upon reasonable request from the last author (TAD).</p>
