<p id="Par26">A small number of common pan-Arctic diatoms belonging to the 
 <italic>Haslea</italic> and 
 <italic>Pleurosigma</italic> genera are known to produce the sea ice biomarker IP
 <sub>25</sub>—a mono-unsaturated highly branched isoprenoid (HBI) alkene, biosynthesized in the sea-ice matrix

 </sup> and deposited in marine sediments following ice melt. Due to its source-specificity and good preservation potential in marine sediments, IP
 <sub>25</sub> constitutes direct evidence for seasonal sea ice. In marine settings, high sedimentary IP
 <sub>25</sub> content generally reflects increasing seasonal sea ice concentrations, whereas the absence of IP
 <sub>25</sub> can either indicate perennial sea-ice cover or open-water

 </sup>. As such, downcore changes in sedimentary IP
 <sub>25</sub> fluxes from a given location can be interpreted to reflect temporal fluctuations in sea ice conditions. A related lipid biomarker HBI III is produced by diatoms blooming in the often ice-loaded and relatively fresher and cooler surface waters typical of the marginal ice zone (e.g. ref. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>
 </sup>). It has recently been shown that the relative abundances of IP
 <sub>25</sub> and other HBIs remain essentially unaltered in trophic food webs and faecal pellets
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>
 </sup>. These findings suggest that source HBI distributions remain unaltered following grazing, which implies that changes in grazing efficiency do not have a significant impact on the sedimentary signature of HBIs.
