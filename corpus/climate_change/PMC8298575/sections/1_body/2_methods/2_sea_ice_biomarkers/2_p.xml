<p id="Par27">Prior to analytical treatment, an internal standard (7-hexylnonadecane) was added to 0.5 g of freeze-dried and homogenised sediment. Total lipids were ultrasonically extracted (×3) using a mixture of dichloromethane (DCM: CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub>) and methanol (MeOH) (2:1, v/v). Extracts were pooled together, and the solvent was removed by evaporation under a slow stream of nitrogen. The total extract was subsequently resuspended in hexane and purified through open column chromatography (SiO
 <sub>2</sub>). Hydrocarbons (including IP
 <sub>25</sub> and HBI III) were eluted using hexane (8 mL). Procedural blanks and standard sediments were analysed every 15 samples. Hydrocarbon fractions were analysed using an Agilent 7890 gas chromatograph (GC) fitted with 30 m fused silica Agilent J&amp;C GC columns (0.25 mm i.d. and 0.25 µm phase thickness) and coupled to an Agilent 5975 C Series Mass Selective Detector (MSD). The following oven temperature programme was used: 40–300 °C at 10 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup>, followed by an isothermal interval at 300 °C for 10 min. The data were collected using Chemstation and analysed using the MassHunter quantification software. IP
 <sub>25</sub> and HBI III were identified on the basis of retention time and comparison of mass spectra with authenticated standards. Abundances were obtained by comparison between individual GC–MS responses relative to those of the internal standard. Biomarker data presented here are reported as fluxes to account for changes in sedimentation rate.
