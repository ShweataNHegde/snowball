<p id="Par42">When plotting both the first marine and lake principal components (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), we included the respective Monte Carlo uncertainty envelopes, which have been propagated as the fractional mean uncertainties of the constituent time series underlying each principal component. The Y-envelope corresponds to uncertainty in principal component magnitude, while the X-envelope corresponds to uncertainty in time. The temporal uncertainties we discuss are associated with these latter horizontal uncertainty envelopes.
