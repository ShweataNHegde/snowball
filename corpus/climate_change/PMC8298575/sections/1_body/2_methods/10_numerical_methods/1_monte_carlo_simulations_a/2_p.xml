<p id="Par41">We performed separate principal component analyses on the median time series of the three constituent marine time series and the four constituent lake time series and only considered the resulting first principal component. We propagated the Monte Carlo uncertainty envelopes as fractional mean uncertainties bounding the first principal components of both the marine and lake records (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). In the marine record, Diatoms and 
 <italic>Chaetoceros</italic> spores both load positively on the first principal component (PC1 loadings of 0.63 and 0.62, respectively), while HBI III loads negatively (PC1 loading of −0.47). We interpret this as suggesting that the first marine principal component is positively correlated with primary production. In the lake record, all-time series (Cd:Ti, δ
 <sup>15</sup>N, sterols and diatoms) load positively on the first principal component (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). We interpret this as suggesting that the first lake principal component is positively correlated with little auk abundance. We do not consider principal components beyond the first but acknowledge that they may also contain climate and/or population signals.
