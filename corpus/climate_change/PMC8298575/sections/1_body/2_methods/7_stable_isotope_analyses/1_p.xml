<p id="Par37">For stable isotope analysis, samples were taken at 2 cm intervals, freeze-dried for 48 h and ground into fine powder. The samples were packed into tin cups and analysed at UC Davis Stable Isotope Facilities, California, USA. Here, carbon (
 <sup>13</sup>C) and nitrogen (
 <sup>15</sup>N) isotope analyses were conducted using an elemental analyser and a continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS). Specifically, an Elementar Vario EL Cube (Elementar Analysensysteme GmbH, Hanau, Germany) interfaced with an Isoprime VisION IRMS (Elementar UK Ltd, Cheadle, UK). Samples were combusted at 1080 °C in a reactor packed with chromium oxide and silvered copper oxide. After combustion, a reduction reactor trap removed oxides and a helium carrier then flowed through a water trap (magnesium perchlorate and phosphorous pentoxide). CO
 <sub>2</sub> was held in an adsorption trap until the N
 <sub>2</sub> peak was analysed; after which the CO
 <sub>2</sub> was released by heating to the IRMS. Reference materials included: IAEA-600, USGS-40, USGS-41, USGS-42, USGS-43, USGS-61, USGS-64, and USGS-65. A sample’s isotope ratio is expressed relative to a reference gas peak analysed with each sample. These provisional values are finalised by correcting the values for the entire batch based on the known values of the included laboratory reference materials. The long-term standard deviation was 0.2 per mil for 
 <sup>13</sup>C and 0.3 per mil for 
 <sup>15</sup>N. The delta values are expressed relative to international standards VPDB (Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite) and Air for carbon and nitrogen, respectively.
