  <p>Global Climate Model projections of climate metrics for the Santa Barbara, California, region through 2100. Top panel: Annual mean temperature anomalies (relative to 1970–1999 base period) in the Goleta-Santa Barbara-Carpinteria coastal region from an ensemble of ten climate models employing the RCP 4.5 (green) and RCP 8.5 (red) emission scenarios. Solid line is the ensemble mean while the envelope is + /− one standard deviation of the individual model annual values from the ten model ensemble mean. Bottom panel: Departures of annual mean sea level (relative to year 2000 values) using three sea level rise scenarios and eight climate model projections using the RCP 8.5 emission scenario. The sea level rise scenarios are the low-range (green), mid-range (blue), and high-range (red) estimates from the National Research Council (NRC) 2012 report
