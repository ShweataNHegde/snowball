 </sup>. Climate adaptation plans are generally developed with a single tipping point target, such as flood exposure. This may be an effective approach in identifying the vulnerability and timing of an individual component of the coastal zone (e.g., human population), but this approach inherently is not adequate to identify the full breadth of vulnerability of coastal systems to climate change (e.g. impacts to natural systems as well as built or human systems). Adaptation planning can benefit from effective identification of multiple SLR tipping points that will result in major and irreversible consequences to coastal ecosystems, such as sandy beaches and tidal wetlands, which provide valuable ecosystem functions and services (e.g. preservation of native biodiversity, nursery habitat and food chain support for rare and endangered biota, fish and wildlife, organic matter and nutrient cycling, coastal flood protection, cultural and recreational opportunities and associated economic revenue), as well as to coastal infrastructure and the human population. Moreover, better characterizing multiple tipping points, and their potential interactions, could help communities better understand the complexity of positive feedbacks
