<p id="Par6">Here we report on an interdisciplinary study to simultaneously assess the vulnerability of major components of a coastal system to climate change during the twenty-first century in the Santa Barbara region, California (USA). Our investigation integrates the modeled SLR response of beaches, cliffs, beach and tidal wetland ecosystems, flooding potential, and socioeconomic exposure to these flood hazards. Through this synthesis we demonstrate that multiple SLR tipping points exist, the identification of which is critical for effective short-and long-term planning, serving as a model for climate adaptation studies in coastal settings worldwide.</p>
