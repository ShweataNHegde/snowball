<p id="Par3">In an ecological context, a tipping point is a condition in which an ecosystem experiences a shift to a new state, with significant changes to biodiversity, and the functions and services it underpins
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>. Several ecological tipping points have already been reached due to climate change and other anthropogenic influences, such as overfishing and pollution, resulting in significant loss of habitat, species, and biodiversity
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>
 </sup>, with a major decline in marine biodiversity since the mid-twentieth century
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
 </sup>. However, individual components of Earth’s physical, ecological, chemical, and human systems will reach tipping points at different stages based on their internal dynamics and sensitivity to external forcing. For example, coral reefs are sensitive to ocean temperature, water quality, and pH, with recent, relatively moderate changes in ocean temperature and chemistry having resulted in significant degradation of this ecosystem

 </sup>, possibly pushing reef sustainability beyond a tipping point
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>. Human populations on low-lying coral atolls, which depend on the reefs for protection from wave-driven flooding
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup>, are also vulnerable, but could develop adaptation options that provide several more decades protection before sea level rise (SLR) reaches a critical threshold for their sustainability
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup>. Defining tipping points for communities is, therefore, quite complex
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup>. A consensus definition for what constitutes a community-scale tipping point has not been established
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup>. How humans respond to physical climate disturbance is dependent on factors that include accommodation space, adaptability, migration potential, and habitat availability, many of which are controlled by anthropogenic factors, such as urbanization and land use change, as well as political will
