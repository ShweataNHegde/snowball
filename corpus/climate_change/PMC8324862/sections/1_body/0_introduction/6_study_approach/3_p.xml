<p id="Par9">For this study, potential tipping points were defined by identifying the SLR scenarios at which subsequent projected changes to system metrics (e.g. ecosystem habitat-rich zones, amount of developed land in flood-hazard zones) exceed 50% compared to current conditions (i.e. zero SLR and no storm scenarios). We assume that a negative change of at least 50% of the total metric represents a substantial change in state at which point further degradation is likely

 </sup>. Further, we assume that projected changes at a specific SLR increment cannot be reversed without human intervention, and therefore a potential tipping point has been reached. We also highlight SLR scenarios where the 
 <italic>relative</italic> increase in projected change between two SLR scenarios exceeds 50%, less as a potential tipping point of system function and more as a moment at which the system experiences a considerable change that may mobilize communities to implement interventions to reduce future losses. We demonstrate that the timing of the projected changes for total system metrics and between SLR scenarios for the different components of this coastal system are out of phase, which can have implications for natural resource management and climate adaptation planning.
