<p id="Par7">We performed a multidisciplinary climate vulnerability study by integrating twenty-first century projected changes in climate forcing with the associated response of coastal watersheds, beaches, and tidal wetlands, and the exposure of the urbanized environment to flooding and erosion. A Mediterranean climate exists in the Santa Barbara region, characterized by warm, dry summers, and sporadically wet, cool winters

Further, the influence of coastal hazards (e.g., erosion and flooding) on the ability of ecosystems to adapt is dependent on the variability and degree of urbanization.
