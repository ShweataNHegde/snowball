<p id="Par11">As recent temperatures are rising at a rate equal or higher than either RCP4.5 or RCP8.5 scenarios, it seems prudent to consider future SLR that accords with the higher RCP8.5 scenario. Downscaled wind, surface pressure and temperature from eight RCP8.5 GCMs were employed to drive short period sea level variability, superimposed upon three long term SLR scenarios (Fig.

 </sup>. Mid-century SLR projections (2050) for the Santa Barbara region range from a median of 15 cm (low range) to 60 cm (high range), and 45 cm to 170 cm by 2100. An extreme scenario that considers rapid warming coupled with accelerated ice sheet decay projects as much as ~ 3 m of SLR by the end of the century for Santa Barbara
