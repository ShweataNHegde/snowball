<p id="Par14">Tidal marsh habitat zones in Carpinteria salt marsh were tracked for SLR scenarios based on the present-day relationship between habitat distribution, elevation and flooding frequency (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C). Although mid-marsh, high marsh, and transition-upland zones currently account for &gt; 90% of the tidal marsh habitat areas, with just 0.36 m of SLR relative to the marsh surface, those zones are projected to comprise only 46% of the tidal marsh, with the consequent loss of ecological function, including nursery and foraging habitat and biodiversity of rare, threatened and endangered species

 </sup>. With increasing SLR, the mudflats and sub-tidal habitats become dominant, including a more than tripling of the lower mud flat area when transitioning from 0.18 to 0.36 m of SLR, and the high mudflat zone between 0.36 and 0.61 m of SLR. During the SLR transition from 0.18 to 0.61 m, areas of the mid-marsh, high marsh, transition, and upland zones decrease most acutely by 54%. Upon reaching 1 m of SLR, mud flats and sub-tidal regions are projected to account for 85% of the tidal marsh, and 97% at 2 m. In short, by ~ 0.6 m of SLR, consistent with sandy beach ecosystems by 0.5 m of SLR, vegetated tidal marsh habitat will have already severely degraded, with the largest change occurring after 0.18 m of SLR. Since the habitat changes are relative to the marsh surface, the timing of the tipping point depends on the rate of accretion and SLR scenario. Assuming a marsh accretion rate of 4 mm/year
