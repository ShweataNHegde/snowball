<p id="Par12">Beaches and cliffs provide the first lines of defense for SLR and storm-driven hazards that can result in the more frequent exposure and degradation of in situ and adjacent ecological and human systems. For the Santa Barbara study area, the relative amounts of beach erosion and cliff retreat are projected to increase most significantly beyond 0.50 m (55%) and 0.25 m (95%) of SLR, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). Coastal erosion rates would be expected to accelerate as the rate of SLR increases under the higher scenarios, but this is not projected for the Santa Barbara region as coastal defenses and other urban infrastructure limit landward retreat in many locations.
