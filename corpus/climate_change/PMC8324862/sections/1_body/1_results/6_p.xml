<p id="Par15">The potential for socioeconomic tipping points was based on projected changes in the number of residents and employees and the amount of developed land and parcel values in areas that are estimated to have daily/permanent coastal flooding (i.e. inundation) and storm-driven flooding (i.e. annual and 100-year return interval events) relative to CoSMoS SLR scenarios (0 to 2.0 m). Changes in flood-hazard exposure were estimated for five communities near the sandy beach and tidal wetland ecosystem study sites, including Goleta, Isla Vista, Santa Barbara, Montecito, and Carpinteria (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Exposure to daily flooding (i.e. no storms considered) for each societal metric relative to study area totals is far below the 50% tipping point threshold, instead only directly affecting 2.4% of total parcel values, 2.7% of total residents, 2.9% of total employees, and 7.4% of total developed land even for the largest SLR scenario of 2.0 m (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D–G). Although total system exposure is not projected to surpass the 50% threshold observed in the ecological systems, there are certain SLR scenarios that could result in considerable, relative increases between SLR scenarios that may galvanize communities to mitigate further losses. For example, the largest relative increases of societal exposure to inundation occurs across all four metrics when transitioning from 0.75 m to 1.0 m of SLR (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D–G, Supplemental Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>), with an increase of 1,712 residents (175% increase), 972 employees (254% increase), $283 million dollars of parcel value (160%) and 1.5 km
 <sup>2</sup> of developed land (144% increase). Peak increases in coastal flood hazard exposure associated with SLR inundation are preceded by the largest increases in the relative amounts of beach erosion and cliff retreat (Fig.
