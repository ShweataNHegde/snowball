 </sup>. For the Santa Barbara region, two RCP scenarios were considered: the intermediate RCP4.5 scenarios wherein emissions peak in mid-21st Century and diminish thereafter; and the higher RCP8.5 scenario wherein emissions continue to rise along with population growth through the 21st Century. Projected global surface temperatures for the 21st Century were downscaled for both RCPs to the study region using 10 global climate models (GCMs) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Using the 30 year 1970–1999 average as a recent baseline, the two RCP scenarios follow a similar temperature trend until 2035, increasing by ~ 1.5 °C. After 2035 the two scenarios begin to diverge, and by the end of the 21st Century have increased by ~ 2.5 °C under RCP4.5 and ~ 5.0 °C under the RCP8.5 scenario. There has been a marked rising trend of recent global surface temperatures, which in 2019 has already reached ~ 0.55 °C above the 1970–1999 baseline, and ~ 1.2 °C above pre-Industrial temperatures
