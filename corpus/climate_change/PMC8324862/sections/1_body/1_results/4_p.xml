<p id="Par13">The future width of the ecologically important upper intertidal zone of sandy beaches in the Santa Barbara region, whose landward boundaries included coastal bluffs, dunes, and armoring as well as intensively groomed beaches, was assessed for SLR scenarios ranging from 0 to 2.0 m in 0.5 m increments (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). Using CoSMoS projections of the mean high water (MHW) shoreline and maximum water levels along the beaches, projected future upper intertidal zone habitat sharply decreased immediately with the transition from 0 to 0.5 m SLR, averaging 74% habitat loss across all beach types, including 87% and 99% for the bluff-backed and armored beaches, respectively, that represent the majority of beaches in the study region, with a resulting loss of ecosystem functions and services

 </sup>. When SLR reaches 1.0 m, &lt; 10% of the upper tidal zone habitat space remains, and when SLR reaches 1.5 m SLR, &lt; 5% remains. Analyzing the loss of the upper intertidal zone when considering SLR combined with annual storms yielded identical tipping point patterns (Supplemental Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). With the most severe ecosystem habitat loss observed after the first SLR scenario (i.e., between 0 and 0.5 m), these results indicate that a tipping point for sandy beach ecosystems may have already been reached.
