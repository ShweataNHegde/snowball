<p id="Par16">Even without considering future SLR, the Santa Barbara region is already at risk from coastal storm, wave-driven flooding hazards (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D–G). The five communities in our study area collectively have 2,302 residents and $345 M in property value in projected flood areas for coastal storms with an average annual return interval, increasing to 3,232 residents and $581 M in property values for storms with a 100-year return interval. These storm-related exposure values rise considerably when taking into account the role of SLR in increasing potential flood areas. Nevertheless, similar to the non-storm scenarios, total system exposure is not expected to surpass the 50% threshold for any societal metric, instead only directly affecting 3–7% of residents and parcel values, 3–8% of employees, and 8–13% of developed land for the largest SLR scenario of 2.0 m (range noting annual and 100-year storm estimates). There are, however, considerable relative increases in flood hazard exposure from 100-year storms when transitioning from 1.5 to 2.0 m of SLR (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D–G, Supplemental Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>), with an increase of 6,542 residents (130% increase), 6,532 employees (171% increase), $2B of parcel value (156%) and 2.6 km
 <sup>2</sup> of developed land (66% increase). This analysis of the physical and societal hazards related to SLR demonstrates that the largest changes in exposure for the different styles of projected future flooding are asynchronous (e.g., when transitioning from 0.75–1.0 m of SLR for daily flooding/inundation compared to 1.5–2.0 m of SLR for storm-driven flooding). Further, when exposure changes are calculated uniformly by comparing scenarios based on jurisdictional and habit area totals and not relative changes, the human system values do not occur until much higher SLR scenarios, are far smaller, and do not qualify as tipping points.
