<p id="Par31">This study examined the wetland evolution of Carpinteria salt marsh, a 93 ha tidal wetland (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This wetland represents an urbanized marsh system, surrounded by urban and residential development that restricts potential upland migration, and an engineered inlet that maintains the tidal connection to the ocean. The system contains a wide range of marsh species and habitats, including salt tolerant pickleweed (
 <italic>Salicornia pacifica</italic>) dominating the regularly flooded middle tidal marsh, and various succulent, grass, and perennial and annual herb species that occur in the high marsh and upland transition zones, including rare and endangered species

 </sup>. Existing habitats were delineated using multispectral aerial imagery as open water subtidal, high and low mudflat, coastal salt marsh, (mid and high), transition, and undeveloped upland. Using Santa Barbara Harbor tide data from 2006–2014 (ref.
