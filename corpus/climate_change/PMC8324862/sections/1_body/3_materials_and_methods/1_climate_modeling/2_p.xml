 </sup> and integrated with short period fluctuations due to tides, meteorological conditions, and short period climate variability (e.g. El Niño) to produce hourly coastal water levels for the study area. Model inputs for the multiple-linear regression model were based on water level observations at Santa Barbara Harbor and historical NCEP meteorological reanalysis data, with the variables including daily climate model data, surface pressure, wind stress, and both local sea surface temperature and central Pacific Ocean sea surface temperature to assess El Niño variability
