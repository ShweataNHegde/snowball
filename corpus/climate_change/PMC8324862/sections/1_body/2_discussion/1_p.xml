 </sup>. Sandy beach ecosystems have possibly reached a tipping point, and tidal marshes will reach that point perhaps as early as ~ 0.25 m of SLR. This timing (~ mid-century or sooner) is similar to the temperature tipping point of the terrestrial biosphere projected to be within just a few decades
 <sup>

 </sup>, although the precise timing of this transition is difficult to determine due to uncertainty related to future climate warming, response of SLR to warming, SLR scenario resolution, and future sediment supply to beaches and marshes. Greenhouse gas emissions are currently tracking the RCP8.5 scenario most closely

 </sup>, so warming is likely to rapidly exceed 1.5 °C and therefore SLR could reach 0.25 m by mid-century under either a middle or high SLR scenario, and just a few decades later for the low SLR scenario (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Even if greenhouse gas emissions are reduced to a net zero level, the current concentration of C0
 <sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere has already committed oceans to an additional ~ 1.7 m of global mean SLR
