<p>Precipitation is predicted to increase by 10%, based on the 100-year extreme precipitation event as well as the most intense 1-day precipitation event in a given year. Rain will become more frequent than snow. Precipitation intensity is predicted to increase slightly during major snowstorms. Air temperature during a storm event determines the vertical limit of snowfall. In Switzerland, the main weather pattern responsible for large amounts of snow is strong northwestern flow. Air masses may still be cold enough for intense snowfall, resulting in major avalanche cycles. In Switzerland, snow depth will decrease in general except at elevations above about 2,500 m. The increase at high elevations is related to higher snowfall intensity with increasing air temperature (
