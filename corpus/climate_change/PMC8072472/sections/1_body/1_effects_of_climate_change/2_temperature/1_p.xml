<p>According to the 2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC) special report (
 <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Hock et al., 2019</xref>), there is medium quality evidence, with a high level of confidence, that temperature increases will cause changes in the frequency, intensity, and types of snowfalls, according to elevation. At lower elevations, the frequency and intensity of snowfall is likely to decrease, causing the snowpack to be thinner and wetter, with a higher average density. The duration and geographic extent of the snowpack will decrease at lower elevations. At moderate and high elevations, changes in temperature and precipitation may be more dynamic, with rapid oscillations between extremes, and with fewer clear trends because of local effects.
