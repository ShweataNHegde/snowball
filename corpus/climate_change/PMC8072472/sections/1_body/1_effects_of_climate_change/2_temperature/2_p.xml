<p>For Switzerland, the projected changes to the mountain cryosphere were recently described in detail (
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">CH2018, 2018</xref>). Climate projections for the European Alps suggest that the warming trend (+2°C since 1864 for Switzerland) will continue, causing decreased duration, depth, and geographic extent of snow cover, especially below 2,000 m. In Switzerland, since 1970, the number of snow days has already decreased by 50% below 800 m, and by 20% below 2,000 m. Projections for 2060, based on the Swiss climate scenarios (for the unabated emissions scenario RCP8.5; 
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">CH2018, 2018</xref>), predict a further warming of 2–3.5°C in the winter months with a rise in freezing levels of 400–650 m.
