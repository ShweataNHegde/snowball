<p>Climate change may affect avalanche accidents and avalanche survival not only in the European Alps and in North America, but also in other mountain regions of the world. With ongoing climate change, the frequency and types of avalanches may change (
 <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Hock et al., 2019</xref>), affecting the rates of avalanche burial and survival. We first assess how the frequency and types of avalanches might be affected by climate change. We then discuss how these changes might affect the pathophysiology of avalanche burial and the survival rates of subjects buried by avalanches. We discuss how such changes might influence the response of search and rescue (SAR) teams and health care providers. Evidence-based guidelines (
