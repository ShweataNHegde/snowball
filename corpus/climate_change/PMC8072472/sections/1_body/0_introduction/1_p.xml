<p>Avalanches are major natural hazards in snow-covered mountain areas, threatening people and infrastructure. Avalanche accidents in the 20th century were characterized by natural disasters and by an increasing number of recreational fatalities following the emergence and growth of winter tourism (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Weather events with several days of intense precipitation, both snow and rain, produced numerous catastrophic avalanches in many mountain ranges, affecting inhabited areas and transportation corridors (

With major investments in mitigation measures, such as defense structures in starting zones and snow sheds to protect infrastructure, especially highways and railways, fatalities in settlements and on roads have decreased in highly populated areas, such as the European Alps (
