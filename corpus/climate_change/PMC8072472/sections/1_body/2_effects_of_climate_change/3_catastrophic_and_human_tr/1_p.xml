<p>Catastrophic avalanches generally result from large amounts of cold snow, while avalanches triggered by recreationists are the result of a particular snow stratigraphy: cohesive slab layers above a so-called “weak” snow layer (
 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Gaume et al., 2017</xref>). The formation of a weak layer is favored by shallow snow depth and cold, clear weather (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). These conditions often prevail in early winter, resulting in a snowpack that consists of layers of faceted crystals and depth hoar when large temperature gradients cause recrystallization (e.g., 
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Birkeland et al., 1998</xref>). This situation is often observed in winters with scarce snow and more generally in interior alpine regions with continental type snowpacks and will likely become more common with the trend towards generally less snow. The presence of persistent weak layers, represents a major threat for recreationists (

 <xref rid="ref66" ref-type="bibr">Statham et al., 2018</xref>). Avalanche risk caused by natural events will also be influenced by changes in land use, land cover, and demographics (
 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">García-Hernández et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Giacona et al., 2018</xref>) that may be affected by climate change. There will be a higher risk of disastrous events where poorly managed winter tourism activities, transportation routes, and exploitation of natural resources lead to increases in exposure. In contrast, risk will likely decrease in areas of depopulation and abandonment of pastures, with reforestation, adequate land use planning, and measures to mitigate avalanche a hazards.
