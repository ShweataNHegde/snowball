<p>Trends for future avalanche activity are difficult to predict using climate models. Avalanches are local and extreme events, with highly nonlinear responses to snow and weather conditions (

 <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">Naaim et al., 2013</xref>). For the time being, it is unclear whether warmer temperatures will lead to fewer avalanches because of less snow (
