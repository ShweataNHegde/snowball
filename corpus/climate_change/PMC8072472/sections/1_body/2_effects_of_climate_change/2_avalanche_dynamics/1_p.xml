<p>Avalanche flow patterns and consequently runout distances strongly depend on the interactions of snow temperatures with snow cover (

If very large avalanches that release in dry snow entrain warm snow lower in the avalanche path, the flow characteristics change, producing shorter, less predictable runouts. These trends towards wetter avalanches in runout zones have already been observed and are likely to continue (

The tree-ring-based analysis suggested that avalanche occurrences and runout distances have increased in recent decades, which the authors attributed to climate warming. They concluded that their findings contradict the intuitive assumption that warming results in less snow with fewer avalanches (
