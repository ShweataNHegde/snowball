<p>The powerful effects of air temperature on avalanche flow regimes were demonstrated in January 2018 and 2019 in Europe. In January 2018, a major storm on the northern slopes of the Alps dropped 2–3 m of snow in &lt;72 h. During the storm, the snowfall limit varied considerably, with rain as high as 2,200 m (

The flow characteristics transformed to those typical of wet-snow avalanches. Overall, the alterations in flow resulted in shorter runouts. This scenario, with large amounts of new snow at high elevations, rain at lower elevations, and flow alterations was hypothesized to be the new normal that might be typical for decades to come, because of climate change (

However, only 1 year later, in January 2019 there was another avalanche cycle on the northern slopes of the Alps with colder air temperatures. There were many powder-snow avalanches that ran all the way to the valley bottoms, causing substantially more damage to forests than the avalanche cycle of the previous year. These two avalanche cycles in January 2018 and 2019 demonstrated the way in which temperatures of air masses during major storms can influence the characteristics of avalanches, affecting the level of hazard to people and infrastructure.
