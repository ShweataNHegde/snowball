<p>Major avalanche cycles in mountains on all continents are related to severe winter storms. Precipitation amounts and air temperatures during storms as well as prior snow stratigraphy affect the frequency and types of avalanches (e.g.,

 <xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">Schweizer et al., 2009</xref>). While it seems clear how climate change will affect mountain snow cover at lower elevations, changes above treeline (1,800â€“2,200 m in the European Alps) are less certain. Most avalanche starting zones in the European Alps are located above treeline. The effects on avalanches in response to climate change, therefore remain elusive (
