<p>A common view, expressed with medium confidence in the recent IPPC special report (
 <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Hock et al., 2019</xref>), is that the number of avalanches and runout distances will decrease at lower elevations. Avalanches involving wet snow, even in winter, will occur more frequently, agreeing with results of a sensitivity study (
 <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al., 2001</xref>) that projected slightly decreased avalanche hazard in winter with an increase in the relative proportion of wet-snow avalanches. The first projection on annual and seasonal timescales of future natural avalanche activity predicted a 20–30% reduction in the French Alps from the middle to the end of the 21st century compared to the reference period, 1960–1990 (
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Castebrunet et al., 2014</xref>). The model results indicate that avalanche activity will decrease in spring and at lower elevations, but increase at higher elevations in winter because of more favorable conditions for wet-snow avalanches earlier in the season.
