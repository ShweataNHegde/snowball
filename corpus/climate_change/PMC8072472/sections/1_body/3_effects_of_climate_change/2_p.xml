<p>Since the majority of avalanche fatalities now involve winter recreationists, most avalanche accidents occur because of characteristics of the snow cover, such as the presence of weak layers and the presence of recreationists. Even if we expect generally thinner snowpacks, more variable temperatures, and occasional rain-on-snow events to decrease the hazard, the frequency of human-triggered avalanches might not decrease if winter tourism continues to be popular. In general, decreases in the amount of snow may not be associated with fewer avalanche fatalities (
