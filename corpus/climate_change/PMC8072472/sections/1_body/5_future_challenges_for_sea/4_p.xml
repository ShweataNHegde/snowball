<p>In areas where avalanches become more frequent, larger, and more destructive, the consequences for local populations might be disastrous, especially in densely inhabited areas. In regions such as the Indian Himalaya, avalanches threaten the population in villages and on roads (
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Ballesteros-CÃ¡novas et al., 2018</xref>). Unlike the European Alps, where most main roads and villages have been protected since the 1960s by structures such as snow fences, barriers, and snowsheds, there are few, if any protective structures in the Himalayas. In many areas, the population is growing and new roads are being built. The impact of catastrophic avalanches on the local populations will likely be greatest in these countries. Unfortunately, there are no organized rescue groups in most areas of the Himalayas, Karakoram, and Andes. In many Asian and South American countries, mountain rescue is performed by the military. In the Nepal Himalayas, most high elevation rescues are performed by climbers already in the area with evacuations by privately-owned helicopter services. Mitigation efforts in these countries should include the construction of protective structures and the establishment of civil protection and mountain rescue services.
