<p>Although in mountain regions, such as Austria, there are always SAR and health care providers on standby, the survival rate in avalanche accidents is about 80% when avalanche victims are extricated by bystanders and &lt;20% when victims are extricated by helicopter SAR teams (

On-scene arrival times, with a mean of about 45 min, are longer than the rapid initial drop in the survival curve at 35 min, after which a completely buried victim with an obstructed airway is no longer able to breathe effectively in avalanche debris. These statistics are unlikely to change significantly with climate change, even if the ratio of wet- to dry-snow avalanches increases. Because most fatal avalanches are triggered by winter recreationists, it will still be critical that people in avalanche terrain be trained in companion rescue, resuscitation, and prevention of avalanche accidents (
