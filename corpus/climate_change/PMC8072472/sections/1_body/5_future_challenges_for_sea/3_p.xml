<p>In areas with well-established mountain rescue organizations, such as Europe and North America, an increase in wet-snow avalanches would require more rescue assets, including personnel and equipment, to extricate (or rule out) the presence of buried recreationists. This would cost increased time and money. Extrications from wet-snow and full-depth avalanches require special techniques, more effort, and more resources than extrication from powder avalanches. In some areas, such as coastal and semicoastal areas of Alaska, extremely deep burials are common. Special techniques, such as ground radar, are sometimes used to find bodies and vehicles under snow depths of 20 m or more. Climate change could expand areas where such events could happen, requiring more SAR teams with adequate preparedness.</p>
