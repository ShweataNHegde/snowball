<p>Survival curves of victims buried in buildings or vehicles in catastrophic avalanches are similar to survival curves of winter recreationists (
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Brugger et al., 2001</xref>). The fatality rate of victims involved in catastrophic avalanches has been estimated to be 12%, compared to about 27% for victims involved in avalanches during winter recreational activities (
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Brugger et al., 2001</xref>). Victims of catastrophic avalanches have a lower mortality because they are often protected in vehicles or structures from traumatic injuries. Avalanche victims trapped in buildings or vehicles may have larger air pockets or connections to the outside, resulting in higher survival probabilities than for completely buried victims in unprotected situations. Two women and an 11-year-old child survived for 37 days in a collapsed animal shed after a catastrophic avalanche in 1755 in the Italian Alps (
