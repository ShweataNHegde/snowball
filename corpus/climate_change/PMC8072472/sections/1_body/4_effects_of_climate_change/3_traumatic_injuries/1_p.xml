<p>In maritime climates of Canada higher rates of trauma were recorded, associated with wet snow and forested terrain, than in continental climates with dry snow and lower treelines (

Blunt trauma and secondary injuries will likely become more frequent. Decreased level of consciousness caused by trauma may further decrease survival probability by predisposing to asphyxiation.
