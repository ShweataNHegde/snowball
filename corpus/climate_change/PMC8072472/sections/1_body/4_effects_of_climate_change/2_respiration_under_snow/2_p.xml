<p>Compression by snow seems also to have an effect on survival (
 <xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">Procter et al., 2016</xref>). Individuals buried &gt;120 cm are five times more likely to die than those buried â‰¤40 cm, independent of the duration of burial. As the snowpack is likely to become thinner, this could have an independent positive effect of reducing burial depth and increasing survival. This hypothesis has yet to be investigated.
