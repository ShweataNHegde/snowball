<p>In the Northern hemisphere, summer avalanches occur between June and October. Summer avalanches accounted for 4% of avalanches in Switzerland between 1984 and 2014 (
 <xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">Pasquier et al., 2017</xref>). Mortality was higher in summer than in winter avalanches, although there were fewer complete burials and fewer asphyxia-related deaths. Trauma was more common in summer avalanches than in winter avalanches, but hypothermia was less common. There were no trends in fatalities over time, so no evidence-based data currently predict an effect of climate change on summer avalanche events at higher elevations.
