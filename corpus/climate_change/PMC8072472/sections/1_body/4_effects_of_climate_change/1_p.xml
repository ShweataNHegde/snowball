<p>The main determinants of survival in avalanches during winter recreational activities are grade of burial (partial or complete), airway patency in cases of complete burial, and the presence of injuries (

 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Brugger et al., 2021</xref>). Trauma is the initial cause of death in about 20â€“30% of victims; asphyxia is the most common cause of death in completely buried victims (about 70%) according to survival curves from Austria, Canada, and Switzerland (

 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Haegeli et al., 2011</xref>). Climate change may affect the epidemiology of avalanche survival. The characteristics of survival curves result from the combination of climate effects, measures to decrease avalanche accidents, improved medical care, and trends in winter recreational activities. The original avalanche survival curve from Switzerland, using data from 1980 to 1991, was similar to more recent survival curves based on data from 2005 to 2013 (
