 </sup>. Nevertheless, it is difficult to account for interactions between elevated CO
 <sub>2</sub> and environmental conditions in empirical models such as those used in this study. CO
 <sub>2</sub> fertilization may expand (or offset) the increases (or the decrease) in suitability by an unknown extent. Besides, climate change impact was calculated as the change in area suitable relative to the current (baseline) and not as absolute change. In addition, smaller or emerging specialty areas that were not represented in the modelling points could have been under-estimated in our study. Crop suitability modelling also allocates similar weight to all the points and yet these points may vary in their suitability from highly suitable to marginally suitable, which is not reflected in this study.
