<p id="Par11">The combined model shows that 27% (299,193 km
 <sup>2</sup>) of Ethiopia is suitable for coffee under current climatic conditions, with the highest area (63%, which is 188,652 km
 <sup>2</sup>) outside the five specialty coffee zones (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Of the 27% that is suitable for coffee in Ethiopia, only about 30% (91,122 km
 <sup>2</sup>) is suitable for specialty coffee production. The individual specialty coffee models show that the Nekemte coffee has the largest suitable area (32,648 km
 <sup>2</sup>, 11.8%) in the western parts of the country, followed by Sidamo coffee with 9.6% of the suitable area for coffee (26,478 km
 <sup>2</sup>) in the southern parts of the Ethiopian highlands. The smallest range is for Yirgacheffe coffee which is only suitable in 1.2% of the suitable area for coffee in the combined model (3,736 km
 <sup>2</sup>, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The most significant overlaps were for Sidamo and Yirgacheffe coffee where 65% (2411 km
 <sup>2</sup>) of the Yirgacheffe was modelled as suitable for Sidamo coffee while 16% (5,170 km
 <sup>2</sup>) of the Sidamo coffee area was modelled as suitable for also producing Yirgacheffe coffee (Fig.
