<p id="Par12">The impacts of climate change on each specialty coffee and the combined effects are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. The results show that the area that is suitable for coffee in the country will increase gradually until 2090s from the combined model (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). In the near future (2030s), the area suitable for coffee will remain stable under all scenarios (less than 1% average change in suitable area). For the 2050s, under SSP126 and SSP245 scenarios, the area suitable is projected to increase on average by 2.9% and 2.3% respectively but remain stable under SSP370 scenario (+ 0.4%) and decrease in the SSP585 scenario (− 1.3%). The area suitability is projected to increase by the 2070s and 2090s under all SSPs. Except for SSP370 where coffee suitability is projected to remain stable, it is projected that coffee suitability will increase on average in the 2070s by 2.3, 3.0 and 1.5% under SSP126, SSP245 and SSP585 respectively. The highest average increase of 4.5% is projected under SSP245 in 2090s (Fig.
