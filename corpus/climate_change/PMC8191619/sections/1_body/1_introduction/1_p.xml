<p>The environmental consequences of climate change such as sea-level rise, increasing temperatures, more extreme weather events, increased droughts, flooding and wildfires are impacting human health and lives.
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> Previous studies and reviews have documented the multiple health impacts of climate change, including an increase in infectious diseases, respiratory disorders, heat-related morbidity and mortality, undernutrition due to food insecurity, and adverse health outcomes ensuing from increased sociopolitical tension and conflicts.
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2â€“5</xref> Indeed, the most recent Lancet Countdown report,
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> which investigates 43 indicators of the relationship between climate change and human health, arrived at their most worrisome findings since the beginning of their on-going annual work. This report underlines that the health impacts of climate change continue to worsen and are being felt on every continent, although they are having a disproportionate and unequal impact on populations.
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Authors caution that these health impacts will continue to worsen unless we see an immediate international response to limiting climate change.
