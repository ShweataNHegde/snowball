<p>With the advent of genomic sequencing, conservation biologists now have the capacity to assess genomic data at a higher resolution than ever before. Not only can overall genetic diversity be analysed but also signals of adaptive evolution, mutations, and inbreeding can now be identified quickly and at relatively low cost. Under a rapidly changing climate, such technology has the potential to revolutionise conservation management; assisted migration, targeted gene flow, and gene-editing can now be performed from an informed perspective, encouraging adaptive capacity and selection for advantageous alleles in threatened populations to improve viability in the face of anthropogenic climate change. Conservation genomics will be of particular value in the management of threatened species with fragmented habitats that are unable to migrate or those with low genetic diversity and limited adaptive capacity. We recommend the application of novel conservation approaches discussed in this review to such taxa in the face of projected climate change. Although such strategies diverge from the traditional in situ conservation paradigm, preservationist methods alone are no longer feasible in the face of widespread climatic shifts. The humbling realisation that, in a comparatively short period of time, humans have induced irreversible changes to the global environment that will be observable in the fossil record for millennia calls for a shift in our attitude toward the world around us [
