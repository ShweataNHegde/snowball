<p>Translocation may also be used as a method of genetic rescue, whereby new individuals (and subsequently new genetic material) are introduced into an existing population with the aim of increasing population fitness and adaptive potential by increasing heterozygosity and adaptive capacity, masking deleterious alleles, countering the effects of inbreeding depression, and reducing genetic load (

 <xref rid="B93-life-11-00653" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. A well-known example of genetic rescue involves the mountain pygmy possum (
 <italic>Burramys parvus</italic>); an isolated population at Mount Buller was supplemented twice with genetically divergent males from larger populations, resulting in increased fitness and fecundity in the subsequent hybrids [

 <italic>Rutidosis leptorrhynchoides</italic>) resulted in similar or increased levels of heterosis across three generations [

Advances in genomics have given managers the ability to refine the science of genetic rescue further by testing for the presence of inbreeding depression in target populations, to predict the likelihood of gene flow causing outbreeding depression, to identify adaptive variation, and to closely monitor the results of population admixture for genetic rescue [

 <xref rid="B93-life-11-00653" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Genetic rescue is likely to become increasingly important under climate change, particularly given the tendency for environmental stress to increase inbreeding depression [
