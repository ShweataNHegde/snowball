<p>Gallagher et al. [
 <xref rid="B82-life-11-00653" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] summarised the traits associated with species most likely to be affected by climate change and in need of assisted migration. Of most relevance to genomic applications to conservation are species with reduced adaptive capacity (poor ability to evolve in situ or disperse), small effective population size, and reduced genetic diversity. These features may be a result of recent population declines, long term effects of narrow ranges (narrow endemics) or niche specialisation, meta-population structure (new or existing barriers to gene flow), and distribution (for example, species in the tropics may have less adaptive capacity for temperature stress due to limited thermal seasonality). Examples of assisted migration outside a speciesâ€™ historical range are rare; however, Supple et al. [
 <xref rid="B89-life-11-00653" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>] examined genomic variation in remnant populations of critically endangered yellow box (
 <italic>Eucalyptus melliodora</italic>) to inform restoration plantings in this species that has been reduced to less than 5% of its original range. By combining genomic data with environmental variables and climate predictions, they were able to identify sites for assisted migration and suitable source populations containing genetic variation adapted to future climate predictions.
