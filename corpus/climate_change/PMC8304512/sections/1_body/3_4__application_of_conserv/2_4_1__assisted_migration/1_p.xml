<p>Assisted migration (or assisted colonisation) is the intentional movement of species to areas where habitat is predicted to become suitable as the climate changes (

This usually refers to translocation of individuals outside their historical range but may include reintroductions to climatically suitable locations within the former range for species that have suffered large historical range contractions. Due to habitat fragmentation, many species that once encompassed large ranges no longer exist along an environmental gradient or have the capacity to disperse in response to climate change threats and stressors. In such scenarios, assisted migration may prove effective, particularly for sessile species or those with low dispersal ability [
