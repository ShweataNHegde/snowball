<p>Another underexplored genetic approach to addressing climate change impacts through evolutionary rescue is gene-editing. Already used extensively in agriculture, gene-editing involves the use of functional proteins to target a location in the genome and alter the geneâ€™s coding sequence or activity (

 <xref rid="B112-life-11-00653" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Commonly, the RNA-guided Cas9 enzyme (isolated from CRISPR acquired immune systems in bacteria) is used to target and cut the DNA sequence, enabling insertion, deletion, and replacement [

Although research to date has focussed predominantly on the application of gene-editing to disease prevention and the suppression of invasive species, with the new capacity of genomic sequencing technology to identify adaptive alleles associated with environmental stressors [
 <xref rid="B115-life-11-00653" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>], it follows that the isolation, introduction, and fixation of these in a population would be possible via gene-editing [
