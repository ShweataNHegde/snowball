<p>Since the late 20th century, the importance of genetic factors in the science of conservation biology has been well recognised; inbreeding depression and loss of genetic variation have been identified as potential drivers of extinction [

 <xref rid="B9-life-11-00653" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For example, an isolated population of mountain pygmy possums (
 <italic>Burramys parvus</italic>) at Mount Buller in Victoria suffered a considerable loss of fitness following a rapid population decline and subsequent inbreeding [
