<p>In the time since European arrival in Australia, native plants and animals have suffered major population decline and extinction. Ten percent of endemic mammal species known to be present in the 18th century are now extinct, and many others survive only on offshore islands and fragmented habitat [
 <xref rid="B1-life-11-00653" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Further, some 38 species of vascular plants, 10 invertebrates, 4 frogs, 3 reptiles, 1 fish, and 9 bird species have been confirmed extinct since European arrival in 1788 [
 <xref rid="B2-life-11-00653" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These impacts have been attributed to a number of factors, most notably land management changes (including land clearing for cropping and grazing), alterations to fire regimes, and the introduction of feral predators, including cats (
 <italic>Felis catus</italic>) and red foxes (
 <italic>Vulpes vulpes</italic>), and feral herbivores such as European rabbits (
 <italic>Oryctolagus cuniculus</italic>) [

 <xref rid="B5-life-11-00653" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], with rapidly warming temperatures and increased frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events such as drought and fire resulting in phenological shifts, range contractions, and population declines in many taxa [
