<p>With the advent of advanced DNA sequencing technologies, it is now possible to approach management of threatened species under a changing climate at the genomic level, taking into account not only genetic diversity and inbreeding effects, but fitness, gene expression, and adaptation [

Here, we focus specifically on genomic approaches to conservation management under climate change in Australiaâ€”a continent with a range of climate change challenges, large latitudinal and environmental gradients, and a biota that has already suffered disproportionate rates of extinction, population fragmentation, and decline. However, the challenges presented by climate change to conservationists and the potential solutions discussed herein are applicable on a global scale. This review aims to discuss the current and expected conservation challenges associated with anthropogenic climate change, followed by the progress of conservation genomics to address these challenges. We explore some of the issues surrounding the application of such technologies to conservation and management strategies and highlight emerging opportunities to apply genomics to conservation in Australia.
