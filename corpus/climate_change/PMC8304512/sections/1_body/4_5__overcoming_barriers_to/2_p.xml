<p>Although many practitioners have been historically averse to admixture as a conservation strategy [

There have been a number of cases of successful collaboration between genetic researchers and conservation practitioners in Australia, such as the “devil tools &amp; tech” umbrella framework implemented by the Save the Tasmanian Devil Program [

 <xref rid="B133-life-11-00653" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. Indeed, the inclusion of non-academic co-authors in conservation genetics and genomics studies (e.g., [

 <xref rid="B135-life-11-00653" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]) has been shown to increase the likelihood of a specific solution- or policy-orientated outcome by up to 250% [

 <xref rid="B75-life-11-00653" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] note that much of the work occurring in non-academic spaces is not prioritised for publication, but it is clear that a holistic, collaborative approach with open communication and engagement between stakeholders is highly beneficial. Such collaboration not only facilitates the implementation of research findings but also encourages targeted studies that are directly relevant to conservation managers and policymakers and fully utilises the potential of modern genomic technology [
