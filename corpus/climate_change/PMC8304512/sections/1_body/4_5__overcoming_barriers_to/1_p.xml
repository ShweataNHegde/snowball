<p>There are some barriers to the application of conservation genomics to management practices in Australia. A detailed discussion of the technical challenges associated with population genomics is beyond the scope of this paper (but see [

First, the link between research and conservation practitioners must be strengthened to allow managers to set goals, make informed decisions, and integrate the findings of conservation geneticists with on-ground management practices in real-time [

 <xref rid="B56-life-11-00653" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] observe that encouraging genome researchers to communicate directly with practitioners about the decreasing costs and potential uses for genomic technology, as well as its limitations, would be a step towards resolving the disconnect between scientists and stakeholders. Kadykalo et al. [
 <xref rid="B130-life-11-00653" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>] identify the need for an interface that allows researchers to engage and connect with conservation managers, who, in turn, may communicate what types of genomic data would be helpful and applicable in the field.
