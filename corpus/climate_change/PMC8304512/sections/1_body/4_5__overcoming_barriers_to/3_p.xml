<p>Second, it must be acknowledged that the application of gene flow and gene editing as management practices carries a certain level of risk. Introducing new individuals to a population may lead to outbreeding depression [
 <xref rid="B139-life-11-00653" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>], although the risk of outbreeding depression occurring has likely been overstated, as there is little evidence of its manifestation in wild populations [

 <xref rid="B140-life-11-00653" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. Care must be taken to ensure that deleterious alleles are not being inadvertently introduced to populations and that locally adapted alleles are maintained [

 <italic>Poecilia reticulata</italic>) resulted in increased fitness without swamping locally adapted alleles; however, the authors note that the results are not directly transferable to other organisms and that genetic rescue should be considered and planned case-by-case [
 <xref rid="B142-life-11-00653" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. Furthermore, adaptational lags to contemporary temperature increases may mean that species are not well adapted to the conditions they are currently experiencing within their home-range, necessitating thorough and careful genomic analyses to choose an effective provenancing strategy for assisted gene flow [
