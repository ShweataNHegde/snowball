<p>Anthropogenic climate change has caused Australia’s average temperature to increase by 1 °C in the last century, and further warming is expected [
 <xref rid="B24-life-11-00653" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. By the year 2090, annual average temperatures may rise by 5 °C [
 <xref rid="B25-life-11-00653" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Climate change has also been linked to an increase in extreme weather conditions [
 <xref rid="B26-life-11-00653" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], including more frequent and intense bushfires [
 <xref rid="B27-life-11-00653" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], cyclones [
 <xref rid="B28-life-11-00653" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and floods [
 <xref rid="B29-life-11-00653" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. These rapidly changing conditions compound the existing threats from habitat loss, fragmentation, feral predators, and competitors and are exacerbating extinction risk, all of which present new and pressing challenges for conservationists [

 <xref rid="B30-life-11-00653" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Two of the most critical issues relate to species’ ability to shift their range or adapt in situ. While species may once have undergone range shifts in response to changing climates during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene [
 <xref rid="B31-life-11-00653" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], habitat loss and fragmentation are likely to hamper this response in the majority of species, particularly those with short dispersal distance. In the face of rapidly changing climate many species may not be able to adapt in situ due to low standing genetic variation, reduced gene flow, and/or limited phenotypic plasticity [
