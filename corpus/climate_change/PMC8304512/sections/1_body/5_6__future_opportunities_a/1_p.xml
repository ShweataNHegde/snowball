<p>Advanced genomic sequencing technology can now be incorporated into conservation management strategies through genomic analyses, targeted gene flow, assisted migration, and gene editing. These methods can all be used in breeding programs, reintroductions, revegetation programs, and translocations to encourage viability in threatened species in the face of rising temperatures and extreme climate events. We see additional opportunities for genomics methods to involve experimental studies and targeted solutions to enable better planning and management for species conservation in the face of climate change. For example, genomic data could be used to determine how phenotypic plasticity and adaptive evolution act within species across environmental gradients in order to predict speciesâ€™ response and vulnerability to climate change [
