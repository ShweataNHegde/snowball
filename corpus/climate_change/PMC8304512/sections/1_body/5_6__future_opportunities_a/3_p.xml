<p>A number of frameworks and guidelines have recently emerged to facilitate the application of conservation genomics and genomic sequencing to wildlife management strategies (e.g., [

 <xref rid="B153-life-11-00653" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>] present a decision-making framework for managers that incorporates the potential and limitations of genomic approaches, as well as guidelines for inferring adaptive capacity and the significance of gene flow in a threatened species population. They note the importance of a robust reference genome (see also [
 <xref rid="B166-life-11-00653" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>]) but also acknowledge that this resource is not always essential for detailed analysis of population structure and signals of selection associated with environmental variables, as evidenced by Grabowski et al. [
