<p>The advances in genomic sequencing methods have made it an invaluable tool for conservation biologists, particularly when studying selection, adaptation, and functional diversity in threatened and economically valuable species [

 <xref rid="B72-life-11-00653" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. For example, genomic studies of the Tasmanian devil (
 <italic>Sarcophilus harrisii</italic>) by Epstein et al. [
 <xref rid="B73-life-11-00653" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] revealed signals of selection in genes associated with immune function or cancer risk in three populations decimated by facial tumour disease, likely the result of an evolutionary response to the illness. This discovery has the potential to inform future selective breeding in the species, enhancing the prevalence of these resistant genotypes in insurance populations for the ongoing persistence of Tasmanian devils. SNP analysis of commercially important abalone (
 <italic>Haliotis rubra</italic>) identified genotype associations with several variable aspects of marine habitat, including sea surface temperature and ocean current, providing important insight into species resilience under fluctuating marine climates [

 <italic>Eucalyptus salubris</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B75-life-11-00653" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] and potential selection in response to sea surface temperatures in seaweed (
 <italic>Phyllospora comosa</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B76-life-11-00653" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. SNP genotyping performed on degraded samples seized from the wildlife trade has even been used to identify population structure and differentiation of threatened species [
 <xref rid="B77-life-11-00653" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>].
