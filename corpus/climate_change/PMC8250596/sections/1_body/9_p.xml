<p>Allen et al. (
 <xref rid="ieam4398-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>) tell us that to make decisions to sustainably balance our needs, we must ask what we want to sustain, for whom, for how long, and at what cost. Apitz (
 <xref rid="ieam4398-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) adds that we must also consider who provides the answers. Who, indeed? In those nations with established or growing autocratic tendencies, we have seen science silenced, falsified, co‐opted, or used as a fig leaf. In other countries, it has, to differing degrees, been utilized to support decision making. However, as much as it has been distressing to see science ignored, it has also been disturbing to have it fetishized. Some have criticized politicians for failing to “obey” the science, suggesting that science alone can make, rather than inform, decisions. Ideally, transparent science is part of a deliberative process, in which the best available models and data are used to help decision makers seek to solve terrible political equations, with trade‐offs, winners, and losers. Uncertainty is made clear, and the roles of precaution and adaptation are communicated and baked into systems. The role of science in this policy making, and its effects, are writ large, with the results of different national experiments clearly visible to those with the stomach to look.
