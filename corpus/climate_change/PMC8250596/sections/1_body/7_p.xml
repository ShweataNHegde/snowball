<p>COVID‐19 has provided a real‐time demonstration of the science–policy interface and an illustration of many concepts we often struggle to communicate. I (and many others) have used source–pathway–receptor concepts to explain how one can make (and adapt) personal protection equipment (PPE) decisions as our understanding of the virus and its transmission evolves. When some have used the uncertainty inherent in COVID‐19 tests to cast doubt on infection and death rates, we have had conversations on how policy makers balance the risks of false positives and false negatives, depending on what decisions tests are informing (and how all tests have uncertainty). This has led to discussions on the precautionary principle and how one manages risk in the face of uncertainty.</p>
