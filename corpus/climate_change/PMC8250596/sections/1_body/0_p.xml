<p>This year seems to have simultaneously lasted 5 minutes and a thousand years. These times feel both momentous and uncertain—times that make one wonder about one's role, and the role of science, in shining a light in the darkness. As I pondered what I could say here to our readership, I took it upon myself to read all 70 editorials 
 <italic>Integrated Environmental Assessment and Management</italic> (
 <italic>IEAM</italic>) has published in our 17 volumes, an exercise I highly recommend. The first editorial of most volumes is a message from the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC) Executive Director, setting a vision for SETAC and the journal's role, laying out new initiatives, or flagging trends. A handful are about the business of being a journal—thoughtful discussions on reviews, impact factors, data openness, and similar subjects—reminding us that SETAC journals have sought to ensure that we are ethical, transparent, balanced, and relevant.
