<p>Some editorials promoted initiatives of interest to SETAC—global horizon scanning, harmonization, nature‐based solutions, chemical governance. Others skewered sacred cows, such as the use of indices, no‐observed‐effect levels (NOELs), lowest‐observed‐effect levels (LOELs), and resource efficiency as the key to sustainability. Many sent up a flag for contaminants or issues of emerging concern or focus such as Se, algal blooms, chemical mixtures, pollinator status, and global climate change (GCC). Others explored framing concepts such as ecological risk assessment, life cycle assessment (LCA), sustainability (and sustainable development goals [SDGs]), ecosystem services (ES), and resilience. The role of these integrating tools in addressing wicked problems was discussed in an evolving dialogue between editors and readers.</p>
