<p>As reported from the European Parliamentary Research Service (EPRS) [
 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-18-06767" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] there are a lot of technologies able to remove the CO
 <sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere. In order to compare them with the traditional carbon abatement technologies an important parameter to consider is the amount of energy needed. In this sense most of the negative emissions technologies (NET) required only a minor increase in the fraction of energy that must be dediacted to these kind of technologies. This is a very important point that must be taken into consideration.
