<p>Analyzing 
 <xref rid="ijerph-18-06767-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows that all the negative technologies reported have quite high CO
 <sub>2</sub> removal costs. Enhanced weathering and mineral carbonation technology is the most expensive (about $1000 per ton of CO
 <sub>2</sub> removed) followed by Ocean Fertilization (about $500 per ton of CO
 <sub>2</sub> removed). The remaining technologies have quite similar costs (of the order of 100â€“150 $ per ton of CO
 <sub>2</sub> removed).
