<p>Amelung et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-18-06767" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] describe effects of this type of health information on stated readiness to choose mitigation actions, as well as on simulation-based carbon emission reductions in a pre-recorded experimental setup among 308 households in 4 mid-size case-study cities in 4 European high-income countries: France, Germany, Norway, and Sweden. For every mitigation action from the food, housing, and mobility sectors, half of the sample received the amount of CO
 <sub>2</sub> equivalents (CO
 <sub>2</sub>-eq) saved and the financial costs or savings the corresponding action generated. The remaining half additionally obtained information on direct health co-benefits, if applicable. For households, obtaining information on direct health co-benefits, a higher mean willingness to adopt food and housing actions was found, and a higher proportion very willing to choose one or more mitigation actions; and an increased simulated reduction in overall carbon footprint: difference in percent reduction equals to −2.70%, overall and −4.45%, for food.
