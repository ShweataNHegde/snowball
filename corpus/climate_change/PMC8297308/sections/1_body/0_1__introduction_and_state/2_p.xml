<p>Some gases present in the atmosphere, called greenhouse gases, are responsible for the greenhouse effect, which plays a fundamental role in the growth and development of life forms. Without serra gases, the earth would be frozen and lifeless. These Serra gases, although present in small quantities, favor the reflection towards the ground of IR rays (which determine the heating of surfaces) coming from the sun. The heat, therefore, remains stored in the atmosphere, resulting in a warming of the air and climate in a ratio “directly proportional” to the presence of Greenhouse gases. GHG can be of both natural and anthropic origin. The main greenhouse gases can have both origins: water vapor, carbon dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and methane. There is also a wide range of greenhouse gases exclusively produced by human activity, such as alocarbons, the best known of which are chlorofluorocarbons, the emissions of which are regulated by the Montreal Protocol.

Yue and Gao statistically analyzed global greenhouse gas emissions from natural systems and anthropogenic activities and concluded that the Earth’s natural system can be considered as self-balancing and that anthropogenic emissions add extra pressure to the Earth system [
