<p>It is possible to note an increase of 2% in the year 2018 in comparison to an annual increase of 1.5% relative to the last decade for both the global GHG emissions and for the fossil Carbon dioxide emissions. This last increase (the increase in the emissions of the fossil CO
 <sub>2</sub>) is due, in particular, to the higher energy demand. The land-use change emissions amounted to 3.5 GtCO
 <sub>2</sub> in the year 2018. In this year (2018), the emissions due to the land-use change and to the fossil CO
 <sub>2</sub> accounted for approximately 74% of the total global greenhouse gas emissions.
