<p>Mitigation refers to actions or policies that both reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that can cause climate change, or that increase the climate systemâ€™s capacity to treat such gases directly from the atmosphere (e.g., reforestation). The main gases that actively contribute to climate change can be indicated as carbon dioxide (CO
 <sub>2</sub>), methane (CH
 <sub>4</sub>), and nitrous oxide (N
 <sub>2</sub>O). Some human activities, for example energy generation from burning fossil fuels and deforestation and agriculture, emit these gases and contribute to increase their concentrations in the atmosphere. The actual concentrations of these gases in the atmosphere have reached values never seen for some 800,000 years or more [
