<p id="Par32">The focus on trait dispersion has an important and complementary implication for traditional conservation strategies of more biodiversity is better. It simplifies the identification of strategies that underpin the maintenance of trait variation of a particular trait and thus a particular environmental driver that is of concern. For example, ensuring connectivity to habitats with higher mean temperature or temperature variation can promote an influx of species or genotypes that can cope with an increasing trend in temperature by maintaining the local trait variation of temperature optima. Local management strategies can target microhabitats that have south-facing sheltered microclimates to promote islands of environmental conditions that reflect possible future scenarios.</p>
