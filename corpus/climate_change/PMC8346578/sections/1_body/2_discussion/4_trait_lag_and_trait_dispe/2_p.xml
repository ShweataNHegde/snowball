<p id="Par31">The trait in our study—the temperature optimum of each species—can also be regarded as a functional trait explaining how species share a resource. In our case, this is expressed as species’ exploration of habitats with suitable temperatures. High functional trait diversity has then been shown to be important for sustaining multiple ecosystem functions simultaneously, since coexisting species can exploit different resources and microhabitats

 </sup>. It is encouraging for the general predictability of biotic climate impact models that the resulting trait dispersion in temperature-related traits strongly correlates with the ability of the community to cope with climate change. This can justify putting the focus on processes that can sustain local community-wide trait dispersion, providing an argument for general biodiversity-enhancing measures such as preserving habitat heterogeneity, maintaining populations of keystone species, and for constructing dispersal corridors.
