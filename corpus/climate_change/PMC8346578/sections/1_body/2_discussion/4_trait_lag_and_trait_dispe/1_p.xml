<p id="Par30">We show that models in which communities are able to maintain high biodiversity after altered climatic conditions will in general also have high trait diversity and low trait lag. This particularly occurs when species have temperature-dependent competition, allowing species to exploit different microhabitats within the same patch. High trait diversity results in high response capacity of the community to climate change and thus a lower overall trait lag. Species richness and trait dispersion can potentially be statistically correlated, as often found in biodiversity and ecosystem functioning studies
