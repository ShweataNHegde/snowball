<p id="Par33">Biological communities are affected by many factors, ecological as well as evolutionary, which influence their response to climate change. Our framework demonstrates the importance of including relevant biological processes for predicting large-scale consequences of climate change on global and local biodiversity. Realistic mechanisms such as species interactions over multiple trophic levels and temperature-dependent competition, as well as particular combinations of dispersal and available genetic variance, can alleviate some of the negative impacts of climate change, showing potential ways for ecological communities to adjust to altered climatic conditions. Despite this, the negative impact of climate change on ecological communities is severe, with numerous global extinctions and effects that are manifested long after the climate has again stabilized.</p>
