<p id="Par23">This work introduced a modeling framework combining dispersal, evolutionary dynamics, and ecological interactions in a way that is tractable, easy to implement, fast to execute on a computer, and can handle ecological interactions of realistic complexity without simultaneously breaking other aspects of the approach. Individual-based models

While the theory behind such models is highly elegant, coupled nonlinear partial differential equations are notoriously difficult to implement in a way that is numerically stable, yields accurate results, and does not require unacceptably long run-times—notably, naive discretization schemes often do not work well. Unfortunately, despite persistent warnings about these problems
