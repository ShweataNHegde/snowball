<p id="Par17">Snapshots from the time series of species’ range distributions reveal useful information about species’ movement and coexistence (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Regardless of model setup and parameterization, there is a northward shift in species’ ranges: tropical species expand into temperate regions and temperate species into polar regions. This is accompanied by a visible decline in the number of species globally, with the northernmost species affected most. The models do differ in the predicted degree of range overlap: trophic interactions and temperature-dependent competition both lead to broadly overlapping ranges, enhancing local coexistence (the overlap in spatial distribution is particularly pronounced with high available genetic variance). Without these interactions, species ranges overlap to a substantially lower degree, diminishing local diversity. Below we investigate whether these patterns, observed for a single realization of the dynamics for each scenario, play out more generally as well.
