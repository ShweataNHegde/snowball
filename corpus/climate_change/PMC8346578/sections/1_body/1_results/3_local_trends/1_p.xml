<p id="Par18">Trophic interactions and temperature-dependent competition indeed result in elevated local species richness levels (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The fostering of local coexistence by trophic interactions and temperature-dependent competition is in line with general ecological expectations. Predation pressure can enhance diversity by providing additional mechanisms of density regulation and thus prey coexistence through predator partitioning

 </sup>. In turn, temperature-dependent competition means species can reduce interspecific competition by evolving locally suboptimal mean temperature optima

 </sup>, compared with the baseline model’s fixed competition coefficients. Hence with temperature-dependent competition, the advantages of being sufficiently different from other locally present species can outweigh the disadvantages of being somewhat maladapted to the local temperatures. If competition is not temperature-dependent, interspecific competition is at a fixed level independent of the temperature optima of each species. An important question is how local diversity is affected when the two processes act simultaneously. In fact, any synergy between their effects is very weak, and is even slightly negative when both the available genetic variance and dispersal abilities are high (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, top row).
