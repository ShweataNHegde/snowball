<p id="Par19">We see a strong tendency for poleward movement of species when looking at the altered distributions of species over the spatial landscape (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Indeed, looking at the effects of climate change on the fraction of patches occupied by species over the landscape reveals that initially cold-adapted species lose suitable habitat during climate change, and even afterwards (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). For the northernmost species, this always eventuate to the point where all habitat is lost, resulting in their extinction. This pattern holds universally in every model setup and parameterization. Only initially warm-adapted species can expand their ranges, and even they only do so under highly restrictive conditions, requiring both good dispersal ability and available genetic variance as well as consumer pressure (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, top row, second and third panel).
