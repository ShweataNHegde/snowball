<p id="Par3">Changing climatic conditions influence species’ ecology, such as demography, biotic interactions, and movement, as well as species’ evolutionary rates. Despite the acknowledgment of the highly important interplay between ecological and evolutionary processes for determining species distributions and survival under altered climatic conditions

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>, few studies account for their combined effects
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
 </sup>. The interplay between these processes has been partly addressed in previous work, showing unexpected results: inclusion of evolution potentially results in increased extinction rates when combined with dispersal
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>
 </sup>, and high dispersal rates do not reduce extinctions since colonization often comes at expense of other species
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
 </sup>. Moreover, species interactions can both alleviate and aggravate the impact of climate change on species
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>
 </sup>, and interact with other eco-evolutionary processes. For example, species interactions can affect a species’ evolutionary response to altered environmental conditions

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
