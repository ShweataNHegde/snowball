<p id="Par8">We show that influence from a second trophic level and, in particular, temperature-dependent competition affect both species distributions and global trends, giving higher levels of coexistence, lower levels of species turnover, and fewer global extinctions. Also, the interplay between ecological (e.g., dispersal and species interactions) and evolutionary (e.g., adaptation to new conditions) processes along a spatial gradient do significantly affect species’ responses to altered climatic conditions in unexpected ways. For example, when species are able to both disperse and evolve fast, temperature-dependent competition results in more global losses than when the capacity to disperse and evolve is low. Furthermore, we demonstrate that community-wide dispersion of species’ temperature optima is a strong predictor of a community’s capacity to respond to climate change, which has implications for future management guidelines.</p>
