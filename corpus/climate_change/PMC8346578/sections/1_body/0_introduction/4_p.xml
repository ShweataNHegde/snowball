 </sup>. Temperature-dependent competition is centered around the idea that each patch in the larger spatial landscape consists of multiple microhabitats, each with a somewhat higher or lower local temperature than the patch average. If the temperature optima of two competing species are similar, they will compete for the same microhabitats and thus experience strong competition. Similarly, competition will decrease if two species within a patch have different temperature optima. A temperature optimum mismatching the local mean temperature will result in a decreased local growth rate, but might still be favorable if it results in decreased interspecific competition.
