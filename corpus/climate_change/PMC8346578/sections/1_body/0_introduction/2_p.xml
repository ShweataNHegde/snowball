<p id="Par4">These very promising eco-evolutionary studies, striving to include a variety of relevant biological mechanisms, commonly depict species interactions in a simplified manner. For example, Norberg et al.

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>
 </sup> take all of the aforementioned aspects into consideration, and their models are important stepping-stones along the way to map out the relevance of species interactions under dispersal, evolution, and climate change. However, they only consider competitive interactions, and even those under more

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup> restrictive assumptions: Norberg et al.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
 </sup>, for instance, set all intra- and interspecific interaction strengths to be equal, and Lasky
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup> uses diffuse competition, whereby species share one common intra- and another common interspecific competition coefficient.
