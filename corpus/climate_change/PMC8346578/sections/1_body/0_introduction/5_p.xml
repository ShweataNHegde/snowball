 </sup>. As we here consider the globe’s full latitudinal range from the polar regions to the equator, we can use our framework to evaluate how effects of local interactions and climate change vary depending on the region considered. We explore the effect of refined species interactions on (1) local trends (within each patch), including local species diversity; (2) regional trends (division of patches into polar, temperate, and tropical areas), including species’ ranges and turnover; and (3) global trends, including global losses and the general community-wide capacity to respond to climatic change.
