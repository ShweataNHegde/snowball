<p id="Par5">To further develop the field of eco-evolutionary studies of species’ response to climatic change, here we present a spatially explicit eco-evolutionary framework centered around a more detailed view of species interactions, interplaying with species’ abilities to adapt to and disperse across local environments. We focus on two extensions. First, we include interactions both within and between trophic levels. Second, we consider the feature that species’ interspecific competition might change due to increasing temperatures, and affect the impact of climate change on ecological communities.</p>
