  <title>Relative change in global species richness from the community state at the onset of climate change (ordinate) over time (abscissa), averaged over replicates and given in 100-year steps (points).</title>
  <p>Black points correspond to species richness over the whole landscape; the blue points to richness in the top third of all patches (the polar region), green points to the middle third (temperate region), and yellow points to the last third (tropical region). Panel layout as in Fig.Â 
   <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>; dotted horizontal lines highlight the point of no net change in global species richness.
