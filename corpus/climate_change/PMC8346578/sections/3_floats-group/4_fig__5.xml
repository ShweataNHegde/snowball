  <title>Range breadth of each species expressed as the percentage of the whole landscape they occupy (ordinate) at three different time stamps (colors).</title>
  <p>The mean (points) and plus/minus one standard deviation range (colored bands) are shown over replicates. Numbers along the abscissa represent species, with initially more warm-adapted species corresponding to higher values. The range breadth of each species is shown at three time stamps: at the start of climate change (
   <italic>t</italic> = 0, blue), the end of climate change (
   <italic>t</italic> = 300, green), and at the end of our simulations (
   <italic>t</italic> = 2500, yellow). Panel layout as in Fig.
