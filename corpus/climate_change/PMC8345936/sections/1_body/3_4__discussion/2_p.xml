<p>Although a warmer winter may be “mortality protective”, extreme cold presents a risk of acute myocardial infarctions [

 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Additionally, warming winters have led to falling-through-the-ice events with drownings [
 <xref rid="B51-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Despite limited research on mortality related to prolong periods of extreme cold and hypothermia [

 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], given the extreme cold events in the southern U.S. during the winter of 2021 with subsequent mortality, this is an area that needs further investigation.
