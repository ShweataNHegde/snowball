<p>There is variability in mortality risk for geographic locations of the U.S. and urban versus and rural communities. Southern regions of the U.S. seem to be better prepared for heat by physiological [

 <xref rid="B74-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. In rural communities there are fewer heat programs and proportionally more outdoor workers within the population, thus increasing climate change mortality risk [
