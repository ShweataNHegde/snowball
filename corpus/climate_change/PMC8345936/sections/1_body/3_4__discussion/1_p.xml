<p>Of the 98 scientific articles reviewed, the meteorological impacts of climate change yield a complex cascade of environmental and weather events that affect ambient temperatures, air quality, drought, wildfires, precipitation, and vector-, food-, and water-borne pathogens. The environmental changes from climate change amplify the existing health determinants that influence mortality within the United States. We found these factors to be in line with the social and demographic disparities that comprise the social determinants of health. Furthermore, heat-related deaths associated with climate change were most frequently studied. Heat compounds existing morbidity, including mental health risks, and geographic, gender, age, racial and ethnic, occupational, and socioeconomic factors that were found to be associated with higher rates of mortality. As expected, older adults are at greater risk of climate change mortality related to existing morbidities [
