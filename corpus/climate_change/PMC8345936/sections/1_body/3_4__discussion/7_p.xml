<p>There are limitations to this integrative review. Primarily, our review is limited to the published peer-viewed literature within the last decade (January 2010 thru May 2020) from the United States. The gray literature may offer additional insights to factors that influence and are responsible for climate change mortality. We limited our review to articles that specifically addressed factors that influence climate change-related mortality; however, climate factors can also influence morbidity that can lead to mortality such as heat-related illnesses that lead to increased hospitalization [

Additionally, the current method of tracking and reporting the cause of death most likely are unreported as the contributing factors for death may not be included in the report by the person completing the death certificate; heat-specific International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes may underestimate heat-related mortality; and studies that rely on specific mortality (such as non-communicable disease (NCD) co-morbidities) are not sensitive enough to identify climate change-related mortality [

 <xref rid="B11-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and there is not enough air monitoring in rural areas to support large studies of air quality and climate change mortality for rural populations. Despite the limitations, this review provides an examination of the factors that influence climate change-related mortality and the areas that need to be developed to fully realize the risk of climate change-related mortality in the United States.
