<p>Changes in air quality, specifically higher levels of ground-level ozone and particulate matter are predicted to increase mortality from pulmonary and cardiovascular disease [

 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B54-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. There is an estimated 0.01% increase in mortality from climate change-related elevated ground-level ozone concentrations [
 <xref rid="B62-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Increased frequency and range of wildfires will add to mortality as air quality is compromised. Furthermore, burn injuries, PTSD, and acute exacerbation of respiratory conditions [
 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and cardiovascular disease [
 <xref rid="B11-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] have been associated with wildfire mortality.
