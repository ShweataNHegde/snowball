<p>This paper outlines the impact of climate change as a cause of death, whether from heat, cold, air pollution, precipitation, drought, wildfires, or infectious disease. Vulnerabilities that influence climate change-related mortality were noted to be age, gender, geographic setting, occupation, income level, and race and ethnicity. Our findings reflect the common indicators that influence morbidity and mortality in the U.S. [
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The social determinants of health (gender, location, occupation, income, and race/ethnicity) along with physiological factors (age and morbidities) influence climate change-related mortality. These factors should be target areas when addressing climate change adaption and resilience.
