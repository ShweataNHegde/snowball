<p>Rural areas are also at risk of heat-related mortality [

 <xref rid="B11-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The ability to quantify the adverse health effects caused by climate change is limited in many rural areas due to lack of available data and interest, potentially leaving many vulnerable groups unaccounted for [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Furthermore, rural communities frequently do not have heat warnings or heat-protective community programs, and outdoor agricultural work is a leading industry; thus, placing rural dwellers at greater risk to succumb to heat. Like rural areas, even smaller more spread-out cities lack heat adaptations and warning systems as the risk of heat exposure is underestimated when compared with more densely populated urban centers [
