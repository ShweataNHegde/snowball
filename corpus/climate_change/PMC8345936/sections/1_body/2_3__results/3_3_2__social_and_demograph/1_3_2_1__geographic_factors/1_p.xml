<p>Climate change, with the accompanying increase in temperatures, does not affect different geographic regions equally [
 <xref rid="B70-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Locations with lower air conditioning usage and milder weather are more susceptible to heat-related mortality as there typically is not residential air conditioning and no way to cool the indoor environment [
 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. For example, people who live in locations with cooler summer temperatures such as the Pacific Coast have a greater relative risk for heat-related mortality than people who live in places like the Gulf of Mexico with warmer summers and moist subtropical climates where residential air conditioning usage is more common [
