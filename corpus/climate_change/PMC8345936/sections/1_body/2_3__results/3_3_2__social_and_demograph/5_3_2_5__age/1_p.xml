<p>The very young (&lt;5) and older adults (&gt;65) are the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. However, older adults suffer the greatest consequences from heat [

Despite the risk of heat-related deaths for sensitive groups, a 10% increase in mortality was observed in all age groups from extreme heat in Washington state [
