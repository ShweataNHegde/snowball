<p>Men are more likely to succumb to climate change-related accidents and injury. It is estimated that 1605 (95% CI: 1430, 1776) excess annual deaths from injury could be caused by 1.5 °C increase in annual temperatures [
 <xref rid="B39-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. 84% of these deaths are projected to be males [
 <xref rid="B39-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] with the excess death a result of transport injuries (resultant risk 739; 95% CI: 650, 814) and suicides (resultant risk 540; 95% CI: 445, 631) [
 <xref rid="B39-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The risk of death of heat or dehydration is greater in young males (maximum ambient temperature, ATmax = 41.1 °C, RR = 1.18) and older females (ATmax = 40.6 °C, RR = 1.05) [
