<p>Urban areas have unique risk related to population density and the built environment. Urban heat islands (UHI), which occur when urban areas have warmer temperatures than their rural surroundings due to the heat trapping abilities of urban development, [

 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Climate change exacerbates UHIs and is responsible for increasing morbidity and early mortality [

 <xref rid="B78-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. The impact of UHIs is associated with a 2.2% increase in mortality; however, with an RCP 8.5 scenario, mortality is projected to increase to 4.3% by the end of the century [
 <xref rid="B83-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Urban areas are also projected to experience greater respiratory-related hospitalizations with increased mortality by the end of this century [

Additionally, those living in more urban areas were more likely to suffer from an acute myocardial infarction on extremely hot days, measured by a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.48 (95% CI: 0.88, 2.49), than those living in less densely populated areas (HR = 0.81 (95% CI: 0.61, 1.08)) [
