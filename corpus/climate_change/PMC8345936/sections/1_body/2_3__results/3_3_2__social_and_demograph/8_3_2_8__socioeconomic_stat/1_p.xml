<p>Socioeconomically disadvantaged communities have been disproportionality affected by climate change [

 <xref rid="B104-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Excess heat-related mortality in New York City neighborhoods is related to poverty, air conditioning access, educational attainment, housing, quality, homeownership, land cover, and land surface temperatures [

 <xref rid="B50-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] found that people in census tracts with less than 14% of families below the poverty line were less likely to suffer from acute myocardial infarction on extremely hot days than people who lived in census tracts with higher rates of poverty.
