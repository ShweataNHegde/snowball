<p>While most heat-related mortality occurs during or directly after extreme heat events, a large portion of heat mortality in many major cities still occurs on more temperate days, which suggests that measures like greater availability and access to air conditioning in addition to current heat emergency responses for extreme heat events are necessary to decrease vulnerability to heat [
