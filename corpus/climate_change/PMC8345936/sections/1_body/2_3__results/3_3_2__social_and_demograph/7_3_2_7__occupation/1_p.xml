<p>Outdoor occupations that require physical exertion, such as construction and agriculture, make workers more vulnerable to the impacts of heat [

 <xref rid="B101-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Agricultural workers had the highest annual heat-related mortality rate at 3.06 per 1 million workers, followed by construction (1.13 per 1 million workers), and waste and remediation services (0.56 per 1 million workers) [
 <xref rid="B88-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Other studies have found that construction workers had greater rates of heat stress-related mortality than other occupations [
 <xref rid="B98-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. A review of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) heat-related deaths (age range 18–72) found that of 79 deceased workers, 76 were male outdoor workers (agriculture, construction, landscaper, oil and gas, and warehouse) [

Hispanic workers had greater risk of mortality than Black workers (RR = 3.22; 95% CI: 2.5, 4.0, and RR = 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1, 4.4), respectively [
 <xref rid="B88-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. The risk of death increased when working alone and heavy work. Roelofs [
 <xref rid="B102-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] reported that most deaths occurred after three or more consecutive days of temperatures at or above 30 °C. Additionally, although several workers succumbed to the heat during the heat waves, others died on cooler days following the heat event [
