<p>Although there are few studies examining the impacts of cold weather on mortality, climate change has increased the intensity of winter storms and extreme cold weather effects on human health [
 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Colder winters are expected in the U.S. Midwest and Northeast [
 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Increasing winter temperatures of 1 °C can lead to a 0.59% (95% CI: 0.37%, 0.81%) increase in annual mortality [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The relationship between age and cold-related mortality is inconsistent. Older adults, and those with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease have an increased risk; however, there is also evidence of cold-related mortality in younger groups [
 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Power outages during cold events were found to have a positive association with all-cause mortality and non-external cause mortality [
 <xref rid="B44-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Increases in outdoor physical activity (snow shoveling) and respiratory infections also contribute to mortality. Cold air suppresses the immune system, can cause bronchoconstriction, and the air is less humid [
 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], leading to pathogens floating more easily in close indoor spaces. Cold-related mortality has been observed on the same day of the cold event and lasting as long as 24 days after cold weather [
 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In addition, Shi et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] observed that with a temperature increase of 1 °C, there was a 3.49% (95% CI: 3.08%, 3.90%) decrease in mortality in the winter in the Southeastern U.S. This was attributed to the region having more variable winter and summer temperatures, which made the 1 °C increase health protective. With warming winters, 10 U.S. metropolitan areas found that future temperature estimates correlated with decreased rates of cold-related deaths. However, in eight of the ten metropolitan areas, the greater mortality risk with heat negated the health benefit of warmer winters [
 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Conlon and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] noted that smaller, rural communities had a greater risk of cold-related mortality. Without consideration of climate adaptation, any benefit of reduced mortality during warmer winters was outweighed by the premature temperature-attributable deaths during summer heat events [
 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="B49-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Annual excess co-morbidity-related mortality (from non-communicable diseases) in New York City during 1997–2013 was found to be eleven times greater from extreme heat than average annual hypothermia-related mortality [
 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Additionally, Barnett et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] found that a reduction in extreme cold events and cold waves later in the winter were associated with lower mortality.
