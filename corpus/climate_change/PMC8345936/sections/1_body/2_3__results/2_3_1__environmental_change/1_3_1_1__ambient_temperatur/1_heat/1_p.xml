<p>Climate change-related heat events pose the greatest risk to human mortality [

 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], socioeconomic status, occupation, and age all influence a population’s ability to adapt to extreme heat [

 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It is well known that extreme heat and other impacts of climate change can exacerbate already existing conditions and lead to premature death [

 <xref rid="B33-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] used modeling to predict overall excess heat-related mortality from climate mitigation and adaptation and projected that the U.S. 2031–2080 population growth would be 34.5% with a low climate response, 54.2% with a moderate response, and 76.2% with strong climate action. In other words, without heat-related climate strategies, U.S. communities will experience a slower growth rate because of excess heat-related mortality. Yet, quantifying this is challenging given the underlying comorbidities [

 <xref rid="B32-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] noted that 47% of the deceased had cardiovascular disease, 27% psychiatric illness, 16% neurologic disorders, 10% pulmonary disease, 9% endocrine disorder, and substance abuse. There are increased instances of death due to congestive heart failure, heart attack, stroke, diabetes, COPD, and pneumonia on extremely hot days [
