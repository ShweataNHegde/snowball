<p>Older adults and those with chronic illnesses are especially vulnerable to heat-related mortality [
 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Heat susceptibility can be influenced by medication regimen, as some medications have been shown to affect the body’s ability to thermoregulate and physiologically adapt to heat [
 <xref rid="B38-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. An increased ambient temperature of 1 °C has been associated with a 1.0% higher death rate in the summer [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A 1.5 °C increase in yearly temperature is projected to lead to 1605 (95% CI: 1430, 1776) excess deaths annually [
 <xref rid="B39-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. An examination of heat-related deaths in 40 U.S. cities found a decrease in extreme heat-related excess deaths from the 1975–1995 to the 1996–2004 period. The reduction was attributed to better heat event forecasting, public health education, and warning systems [
 <xref rid="B40-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Seasonality and region also play a role in heat-related mortality. For example, during the summer months in Florida (May–October), there was an increase in work-related (25/100,000) and non-work-related deaths (158/100,000) during the 2005–2012 study period [
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Further, exposure to large temperature variability was found to lead to an increased risk of mortality [
