<p>Despite the gains in mortality from warmer winters, Hansel et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] reported that individuals over 65 years old with COPD had a 19% increased risk of dying on cold days. Cold temperatures are associated with mucous hypersecretion, bronchoconstriction, inflammation, and increased risk of exacerbation of COPD [
 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Extreme cold was also associated with an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) [
