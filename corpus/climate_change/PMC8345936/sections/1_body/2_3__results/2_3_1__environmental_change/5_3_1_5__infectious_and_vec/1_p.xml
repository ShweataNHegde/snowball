<p>More precipitation from climate change may block drainage systems and produce stagnant water; this plus warmer air temperatures can create a breeding ground for diseases carrying insects. In fact, the overall number of insects is expected to rise globally [

Climate change could affect the frequency and expand the geographical range of diseases [
