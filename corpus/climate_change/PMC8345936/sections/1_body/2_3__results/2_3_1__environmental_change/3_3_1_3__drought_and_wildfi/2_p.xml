<p>There is growing evidence of associations between wildfire smoke exposure and all-cause mortality [

 <xref rid="B11-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] have been associated with wildfire mortality. A limitation in determining the impact on health and mortality from wildfire smoke is that wildfires tend to occur in rural areas where there are fewer or no air pollution monitoring networks to make an association between air quality and mortality. Reid et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] noted that there are too few studies and inconsistent findings to determine an association between wildfire smoke and cardiovascular mortality, despite the evidence that PM is associated with increased cardiovascular deaths.
