<p>Ground-level ozone formation is favored with hotter temperatures and stagnant conditions while precipitation will impact PM concentrations [

 <xref rid="B61-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. There is a wide range of data related to mortality and morbidity due to changes in ozone concentrations from climate change. The climate change air quality models have predicted 600 to 2500 cases of nonaccidental mortality related to climate change that could be avoided from the changes in ozone concentrations [
 <xref rid="B61-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Chang et al. [
 <xref rid="B62-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] estimated a 0.01% increase in mortality due to elevated ground-level ozone concentrations related to future climate change. Future ozone concentrations are expected to increase by 0.43 ppb as reported in the prediction interval (PI) (95% PI: 014–0.75) in the period 2041–2050 compared to in 2000 [

 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]). Climate change may result in summer daily maximum (8 h average) ozone concentrations changing by 3% and annual PM
