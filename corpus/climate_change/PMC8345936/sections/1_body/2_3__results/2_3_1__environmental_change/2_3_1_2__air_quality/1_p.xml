<p>Atmospheric photochemical reactions are likely to be enhanced with increasing temperatures. Most importantly, ground-level ozone and particulate matter (PM) concentrations will be impacted. Increased ozone or particulate matter concentrations have been linked to increased mortality related to pulmonary and cardiovascular disease [
