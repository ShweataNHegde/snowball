 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-18-08220" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] noted that climate change increased health risks of Americans and made already vulnerable and marginalized groups such as children, older adults, people of color, and low-income communities at greater risk of mortality. Those impacts include heat waves, wildfires, poor air quality, infectious diseases (vector-, food- and waterborne), and extreme water events such as flooding.
