<p>While most research has focused on how specific aspects of climate change (heat waves, extreme weather events, flooding, etc.) have affected mortality, few studies give an in-depth analysis of the scope of climate’s effect on factors that influence climate change-related mortality [

It is important to have a comprehensive understanding of the collective factors that influence climate change mortality to understand the impacts on human health, thus we are examining the climate change-related factors that lead to mortality. Mortality is used as the measure of climate change impacts because mortality is an indication of risk and severity of an exposure [

Therefore, we conducted an integrative review of the peer-reviewed literature to identify the factors that influence climate change-related human mortality in the United States in the past decade (2010–2020). The review was limited to the U.S. to reduce confounding of other factors that influence mortality such as country specific climate change adaptation and resilience, health systems, and access to health care. The period of 2010–2020 was selected to provide the most recent decade experiencing the impacts of climate change.
