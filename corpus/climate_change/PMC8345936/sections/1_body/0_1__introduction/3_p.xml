<p>The human toll of climate change extends beyond the effects of extreme heat. There is a relationship between extreme cold events from ocean warming in the Arctic and weakening of the Arctic jet stream causing cold air to move further south in the Northern Hemisphere [

The greater prevalence of droughts and wildfires coupled with an increase in greenhouse gas emissions has had serious negative effects on air quality in the United States which has been linked to an increase in mortality related to pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases [
