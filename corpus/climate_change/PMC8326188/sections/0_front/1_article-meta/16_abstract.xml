  <p>A changing climate will have demonstrable effects on health and healthcare systems, with specific and disproportionate effects on communities in Africa. Emergency care systems and providers have an opportunity to be at the forefront of efforts to combat the worst health effects from climate change. The 2020 African Conference on Emergency Medicine, under the auspices of the African Federation for Emergency Medicine, convened its first ever workshop on the topic of climate change and human health. Structured as a full day virtual course, the didactic sections were available for both live and asynchronous learning with more than 100 participants enrolled in the course. The workshop introduced the topic of the health effects of climate as they relate to emergency care in Africa and provided a forum to discuss ideas regarding the way forward. Lectures and focused discussions addressed three broad themes related to: health impacts, health care delivery, and advocacy. To our knowledge, this is the first workshop for health professionals to cover topics specific to emergency care, climate change, and health in Africa. The results of this workshop will help to guide future efforts aimed at advancing emergency care approaches in Africa with regard to medical education, research, and policy.</p>
