Policies may ensure that existing and future emergency centre infrastructure is climate resilient; early warning systems and disaster plans are current and actionable; climate and health education is incorporated in all levels of health professional education; emergency centres have emergency response checklists [
 <xref rid="bb0325" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] that incorporate climate threats and protocols; health care facilities have energy resilience to offer definitive care for patients requiring surgical interventions and procedures; health facilities commit to minimising their climate footprint; Health and Climate Change Country Profiles are incentivised; health is in all National Adaptation Plans on the continent [
 <xref rid="bb0330" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]; renewable energy is scalable across nations [
 <xref rid="bb0335" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]; and African leaders are involved in special reports on climate change and health at all international convenings. Tools specific to emergency care can advance research on the ECS and make it easier for emergency care providers and policy makers to advocate for culturally relevant public health solutions [
