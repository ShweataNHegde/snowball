<p id="p0275">From the pre-conference and associated working group feedback, the authors propose an agenda for a path forward to 1) improve health professional education on climate and health, 2) increase evidence-based research on climate-related health impacts and evidence-based interventions, and 3) engage more emergency health professionals from the African continent in local, national, and international climate policy work. All proposals are with the aim of developing solutions that are context-specific to African countries.</p>
