<p>The climate change-related eye diseases selected above represent an annual cost of between 22.63 and 23.31 billion euros, that is, between 1.9% and 1.95% of national Spanish GDP (
 <xref rid="ijerph-18-07197-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). 36.5% of this figure can be attributed to climate change variables (0.7% GDP; between €8.26 and €8.51 billion). Mitigation measures centered on afforestation and greenhouse gases (GG) control involve a cost of €13.15 billion (1.1% GDP), but the expected benefit due to energy saving reaches between €16.5 and €25.7 billion (1.38–2.15% GDP). Thus, even with the least optimistic forecast, 0.28% GDP would be saved, adding the progressive reduction by 0.7% of GDP due to health care cost in ocular diseases partially attributable to climate change, and the intangible benefits of wellbeing and life-quality that reducing life-limiting illness implies (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-18-07197">Supplementary Material Table S2</xref>). In any case, the cost of controlling GG would have benefits for any disease exacerbated by environmental variables related to climate change, and not just eye disease.
