<p>The progressive recovery of the ozone layer from international action on chlorine-fluorocarbon gases has achieved the maintenance or even a slight reduction in the average UVR (UV index) [

However, the trend of decreasing relative humidity due to increasing average temperatures aggressively increases UVR due to the lower radiative forcing (higher penetration) of this wavelength because of less filtering from water aerosols; moreover, air pollution also enhances the UVR penetration [
