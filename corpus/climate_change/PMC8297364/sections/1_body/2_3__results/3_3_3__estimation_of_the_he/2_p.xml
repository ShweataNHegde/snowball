<p>Each heatwave increases the TRD risk by 2.47 times for people under age 75 years. In Spain, in 2020, the number of days per year in which heatwave thresholds are exceeded is twice as high as during the mid-1980s [

This implies an increase in TRD risk for people under age 75 years calculated at 17.3% only during that one summer. The trend identified from REDIAM data is a doubling of heatwave days from 1992 to 2020 (from 4 to 8 days) (
