<p>Concerning Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD), people exposed to summer sun &gt;5 h/day during adolescence and 30 years of age, at the initial examination, were at greater risk of developing increased macular pigment and early AMD (OR 2.14; CI = 95%, 0.99–4.61; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.05) 10 years earlier than people sun-exposed &lt;2 h/day during the same periods. Nevertheless, in patients reporting high summer sun exposure during their teenage years and 30 years old, the use of hats and sunglasses for half of those periods were associated with a lower risk of soft drusen (Relative Risk (RR) = 0.55; CI = 95%, 0.33–0.9;
