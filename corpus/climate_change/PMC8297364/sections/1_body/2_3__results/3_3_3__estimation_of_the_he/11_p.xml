<p>Regarding auto-immune systemic diseases with ocular impact (non-infectious uveitis), it is necessary to highlight that environmental pollutants are one of the main triggering factors for its development, emphasizing especially:

   <p>In Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), genetic factors explain &lt;50% of the risk of developing this disease; however, a 31% increase in risk has been identified in people living within &lt;50 m from the main road (with traffic and, therefore, intense pollution) [
    <xref rid="B107-ijerph-18-07197" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. In Spain alone, RA accounted for a €1.12 billion/year burden of necessary health care, indirect costs and associated sick leave [
    <xref rid="B108-ijerph-18-07197" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Mitigating the pollutant factor could save the Spanish State 350 million (M) euros, as well as undoubtedly reducing the suffering caused by this type of disease.

   <p>In Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS), a &gt;60% correlation with pollutant particles (PM
    <sub>2.5</sub>) has been found: a prolonged exposure leads to worsening in the control of the inflammatory outbreak of this disease [
    <xref rid="B109-ijerph-18-07197" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. An average cost to address AS in Spain of 11,462 euros/patient/year has been estimated, including direct costs and productivity losses [
    <xref rid="B110-ijerph-18-07197" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. In 2017, 1.9% of Spanish people suffered from this disease (900,000 people), implying an annual average cost of €10.3 billion of the Spanish Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Such a cost could be reduced by €6 billion just by controlling environmental factors.

   <p>Pollutants determine an association with inflammatory outbreaks of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Thus, PM
    <sub>10</sub> particles were 8% associated with an increase of relapse during the cold season, whilst ozone was 16% associated during the hot season (therefore, ozone is pathogenically triggered by high temperatures) [

    <xref rid="B112-ijerph-18-07197" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Around 50,000 people in Spain suffer from this disease, whose average cost is 30,000 euros/patient/year; this implies a global burden of €1.4 billion/year [
    <xref rid="B113-ijerph-18-07197" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>], added to the severe disability which it involves. 112 to 224 million euros/year could be saved by controlling pollutants alone, without taking into account the benefit to be gained by controlling high temperatures and, thus, avoiding the exacerbation suffered by MS patients (Uhthoff phenomenon) [

   <p>Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) include Crohn’s disease (CD), Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Non-classifiable IBD. Their estimated prevalence is 0.3% of the European population, showing an increasing incidence of 176,000 cases per year. It has been calculated that 2.5–3 million people in Europe suffer from IBD. This implies a very high total annual cost of health care. Based on an average of diagnosed patients in 2010 throughout 28 European medical centers during the first year after diagnosis, a total cost of 5942 euros/patient for CD, 2753 euros/patient for UC, and 2898 euros/patient for non-classifiable IBD was calculated. Furthermore, each day of heatwave increases by 4.6% the outbreak risk for IBD [

    <xref rid="B116-ijerph-18-07197" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>], and thus the derived visual impairment. For example, Málaga city (Southern Spain) suffered 11 heatwave days only in 2019; therefore, the outbreak risk of IBD was increased by 50.6%, adding to the high health care burden and personal suffering which this implies.

   <p>The prevalence of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) in Spain is 9/10,000 inhabitants [
    <xref rid="B117-ijerph-18-07197" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. The patient/year cost ranges between 3604 and 5968 euros, according to the severity [
    <xref rid="B118-ijerph-18-07197" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. Relating to prevalence and cost per patient, the control of this disease involves a €201 million burden in Spain. Concerning environmental parameters, SLE outbreaks are twice as likely to occur in sun-exposed workers fin a year, and 7.9 times more likely to develop if they suffer sunburn from intense exposure to the sun [

   <p>Sarcoidosis is a disease with high prevalence in Spain (1/1000 inhabitants) [
    <xref rid="B120-ijerph-18-07197" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. Although there is no information about the cost of its treatment, data from the USA points out that insurance companies spend 19,714 dollars/patient/year among direct costs of medical attention and secondary costs because of sickness absences [
    <xref rid="B121-ijerph-18-07197" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. Extrapolating this data to Spain, the disease costs would be equivalent to almost €784 million/year. The relation between Sarcoidosis and environmental factors is essential, given that its pathogenesis is characterized by exposure to dust and both natural and urban pollution (PM
    <sub>10</sub> and PM
    <sub>2.5</sub>), together with dryness and high temperatures [
    <xref rid="B122-ijerph-18-07197" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. Southern Spain records more than 20 events per year with Saharan dust advection from May to September [
    <xref rid="B123-ijerph-18-07197" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. There are no numerical studies on the evolution of this disease in Spain, but researches from the Midwest of the USA (where dust storms are frequent) reveal that the prevalence doubled between 1995 and 2010, without a relationship to an increase in the population [
    <xref rid="B124-ijerph-18-07197" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. Extrapolating these data to Spain, a higher frequency of dust storms related to higher dryness and advection from Africa could involve doubling of the health care costs related to Sarcoidosis.
