From 1990 to 2015, the number of disability-adjusted life years (DALY) and the age-standardized DALY rate for glaucoma increased by 122% and 15%, respectively; in addition, glaucoma was associated positively with national levels of UVR and PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>. Besides, lower socio-economic level, advanced age, female gender, higher UVR (increasing the incidence by 11% depending on the number of hours outdoors) and higher air pollution level was significantly associated with a higher frequency of glaucoma [
