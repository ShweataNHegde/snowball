 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-18-07197">Table S1</xref>, where each pathology is related to the climatic and environmental variables that affect them. Furthermore, in order to address this problem concisely, environment variables and potentially affected eye structures have been crossed in 
 <xref rid="ijerph-18-07197-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Both the environmental values of Southern Spain and the most frequent ocular pathologies in that region have been considered.
