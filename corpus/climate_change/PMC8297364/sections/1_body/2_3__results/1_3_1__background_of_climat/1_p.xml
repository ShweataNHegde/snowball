<p>As in other parts of the Mediterranean Region [
 <xref rid="B70-ijerph-18-07197" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], the observed trends in these two cities can be synthesized as follows (for more information, see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-18-07197">Supplementary Material Tables S1 and S2</xref>): a sustained increase in air temperatures of about 0.1–0.4 °C/decade (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-07197-f001">Figure 1</xref>a), which has changed the Köppen-Geiger classification for Almería Airport from BSk to BSh (warmer sub-desertic climate), and the average annual temperature for Málaga Airport from 17.96 °C (1961–1990) to 18.76 °C (1991–2020); the higher frequency of heatwaves (maximum daily temperatures &gt; 36.6 °C) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-07197-f001">Figure 1</xref>b); increase in tropical days (minimum daily temperatures &gt; 20 °C), 3 to 6/decade (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-07197-f001">Figure 1</xref>c), and torrid days (minimum daily temperatures &gt; 25 °C) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-07197-f001">Figure 1</xref>b). Moreover, droughts point to a higher frequency because of lower relative humidity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-07197-f001">Figure 1</xref>d) and lower annual volume of rainfall (i.e., Almería Airport, 1961–1990: 216 mm.; Málaga Airport: 583 mm.; Almería Airport, 1991–2020, 201 mm; Málaga Airport: 487 mm.); both values classify Málaga as a semiarid climate and Almería as an arid one. Floods and erosive processes from pouring rain also tend to be more frequent and hydric resources are decreasing [

 <xref rid="B76-ijerph-18-07197" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], which is vital to analyze the evolution of triggering factors for global warming. No significant trend has been identified regarding UVR, despite a slight trend towards decrease. These results agree with other estimations conducted for Andalusia by the Ministry of Ecological Transition (MITECO) [
 <xref rid="B77-ijerph-18-07197" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], as well as with general estimates for the Mediterranean region by other official reports [
