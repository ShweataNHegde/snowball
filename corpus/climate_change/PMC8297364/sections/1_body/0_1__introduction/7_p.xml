<p>However, information on the long-term impact of climate change on eye diseases regarding their economic effects is lacking. Therefore, the main aims of this investigation are (i) to demonstrate the association between common eye diseases and environmental factors, taking as a reference two highly populated cities in Southern Spain (Málaga and Almería), which are considered highly vulnerable areas to climate change; and (ii) to estimate, using the available literature, the health expenditure involved in combating these diseases and the savings that would be made by mitigating the environmental factors that aggravate them. To achieve these goals, mixed methods to assess the cross-variables (environmental factors, eye diseases and health costs) were used. We hypothesize that current research could focus on the work of those interested in the role of climate change regarding ocular health and may be useful to policymakers in order to explore associated economic damages of a policy of non-intervention concerning climate change.</p>
