<p>Air quality is also a conditioning factor for human health, especially concerning other pollutants than carbon dioxide. Among these, tropospheric ozone must be highlighted as a common urban pollutant [
 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-18-07197" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] that may be magnified by heatwaves [

 <xref rid="B38-ijerph-18-07197" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Moreover, acute pollution events, which are related to high atmospheric stability, heatwaves and droughts, have been associated with high levels of aerodynamic particles (PM
 <sub>10</sub>, PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>) involving severe outbreaks of premature mortality [
