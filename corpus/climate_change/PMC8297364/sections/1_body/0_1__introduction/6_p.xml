<p>Furthermore, as an effect of climate change, mismanaged human systems lead to malnutrition, work-related health problems and mental disorders. Thus, malnutrition or undernourishment is a direct effect of changes in harvest because of temperature changes or rainfall regimes, especially in those areas where agriculture and livestock have naturally low productivity [

Moreover, they also suffer vector-borne outbreaks, psycho-physical damage and secondary ocular diseases such as pterygium, glaucoma and retino-choroidal injuries. Farmers have eight times higher possibilities of suffering ocular damage than other professionals.
