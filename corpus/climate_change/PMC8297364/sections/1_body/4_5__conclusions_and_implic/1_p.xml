<p>The increase in eye diseases will have a strong economic and social impact if no mitigation measures are taken against climate change, as much evidence points to a link between weather and climate variables enhanced by climate change and eye-related diseases. Therefore, if proper management can mitigate the effects of climate change, consequently, this can reduce health problems. We propose a new concept: disease sink. By analogy with carbon sinks, a disease sink can be understood as any action to mitigate environmental factors exacerbated by climate change that reduces the incidence or morbidity of disease and consequently generates a health benefit. Producing disease sinks can also bring social and economic benefits resulting from improved environmental quality and savings in climate change adaptation measures. Our data and the scientific literature analysed indicate that southern Spain is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Higher temperatures, more frequent torrential rainfall and droughts, fires, floods, coastal phenomena, alteration of water resources, alteration of habitats and poor pollution control are all elements that directly or indirectly exacerbate numerous eye diseases. At the national level, the estimated health expenditure for the fight against these ocular diseases alone is between 22.63 and 23.31 billion euros per year, with 36.5% of this figure attributed to environmental variables exacerbated by climate change. There is no exact data at the regional level, but the higher incidence of climate change effects estimated for Andalusia indicates that a significant part of this figure is for this region, one of the lowest per capita income regions in Spain.</p>
