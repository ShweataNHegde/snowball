<p>In conclusion, medium-term mitigation and long-term reversal of the effects of climate change are essential for our health; adaptation is not an option, as it requires more funds, which not all countries or regions can afford. We hope that this research will guide researchers interested in the role of climate change concerning health in general and eye health in particular, and will help policymakers to redress the economic damage associated with a policy of non-intervention regarding climate change.</p>
