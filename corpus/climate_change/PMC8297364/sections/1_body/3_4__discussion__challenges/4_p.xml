<p>The benefit of the intervention in climate change variables could be appreciated via the reduction of related ocular pathologies. This would represent an important decrease in human morbidity and a significant reduction of the health care burden needed to address it. A carbon sink has been defined as any process or mechanism that removes a greenhouse gas, an aerosol or a precursor of greenhouse gas from the atmosphere. A given reservoir can be an atmospheric carbon sink if, during a given time interval, more carbon enters than leaves [

Similarly, any process or mechanism that eliminates or reduces a harmful effect or environmental health risk can be defined as a disease sink. In this way, this new concept of disease sink can also be understood as any action in favor of climate change mitigation. As was mentioned, the effects of climate change have direct impacts on the incidence or morbidity of diseases. Consequently, mitigation measures must involve a health gain, as a disease sink.
