<p>Finally, we have estimated the health expenditure for the fight against these diseases as between 22.63 and 23.31 billion euros per year, as can be seen in 
 <xref rid="ijerph-18-07197-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. We have estimated that, on average, 36.5% of this expenditure is attributable to the increase in eye diseases due to environmental factors related to climate change. There is no exact data at the regional level, but the higher incidence of climate change effects estimated for southern Spain indicates that a significant share of this figure corresponds to this region. In an ideal scenario of mitigating the effects of climate change, considering only the costs of afforestation-reforestation and greenhouse gas control, and ignoring the benefits of energy savings, an investment of 13.15 billion euros would be required, but this value is useful for any disease exacerbated by environmental variables related to climate change: this would be the estimated price of disease sinks for Spain.
