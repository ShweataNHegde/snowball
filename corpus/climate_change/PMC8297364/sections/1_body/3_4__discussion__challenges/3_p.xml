<p>Reducing global warming needs a reduction in GG emission, and other actions related to afforestation, reforestation and changes in crop management, given that the latter measures favor carbon sinks; furthermore, in urban environments, modulating temperature means controlling emissions of ozone, PM
 <sub>10</sub> and PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>, as well as other pollutants; there is also a need to change the albedo of buildings and increase green spaces. The increase in radiation (especially UV) can be stopped if the increase in temperature is effectively controlled.
