<p>Adaptation to climate change, therefore, would imply a permanent annual increase in expenditure on eye health to try to mitigate the effects of this process. Mitigation, on the other hand, would imply a reduction in expenditure, as well as an improvement in the health and quality of life of the population. The verification of this fact will depend on the success of global and local measures to mitigate the effects of climate change, but our data suggest that adaptation to climate change involves permanently increasing costs, while mitigation could reduce these if successful.</p>
