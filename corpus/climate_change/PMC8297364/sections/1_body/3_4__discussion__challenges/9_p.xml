<p>Returning to the goals of this research, the literature consulted amply demonstrates the links between environmental factors related to climate change and eye diseases. Applying this fact to an arid and semiarid area such as Southern Spain, the analysis of environmental variables shows a high vulnerability in the population to suffer increasingly from eye diseases due to the impact of climate change: higher temperatures, more frequent droughts, forest fires, floods and erosive processes from pouring rain, depletion and pollution of water resources, coastal losses and coastal phenomena, habitat alteration, water-borne diseases and other altered variables like ground-level ozone, pollutant precursors of ground-level ozone, greenhouse gases, acidifying agents, PM

In contrast, the Andalusian population accounts for 18.1% of the total Spanish population. This implies lower levels of income and resources for Andalusia, which is the third Spanish autonomous community with the lowest income per capita (19,658€ compared to a national average of 26,438€), only ahead of the autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla [
