<p>Finally, information on the costs of these diseases was examined in the available literature, resulting in the attribution of the health costs of eye diseases to climate change. An economic assessment of the estimated costs of the most frequent ocular pathologies has been developed. Sun exposure excess, high temperatures, pouring rain, wind or pollution effects, among others, are approachable variables with regard to land management solutions. By looking at the most common ocular diseases and their high impact on health, it is possible to see the magnitude of the problem.</p>
