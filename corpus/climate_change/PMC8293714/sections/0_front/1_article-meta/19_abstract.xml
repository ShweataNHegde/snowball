 <p>We determined how each species of terrestrial salamander (
  <italic toggle="yes">Plethodon</italic>) from the Pacific Northwest would respond to climate change under several greenhouse scenarios. We asked whether we can expect a concerted response to climate change due to similarity in ecological niche or independent responses that could be harder to manage across species. While some established habitats may become more or less suitable over time, the overall distribution of species in this group is unlikely to be significantly affected, and distributions in this group are more strongly influenced by precipitation than temperature.
