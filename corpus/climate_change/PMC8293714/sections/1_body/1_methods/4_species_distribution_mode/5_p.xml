<p>We assessed how the SDMs changed over time in several different ways. First, we compared projection overlap from the current model to those for each future projection (8 per species/group) using the R package 
 <italic toggle="yes">ENMTools</italic> as above. Next, we calculated the sum and mean of the raster layer for each SDM (i.e., the suitability scores for each model were summed and averaged) in order to quantify suitability of available habitat. The current value was subtracted from the future value to report a single number that represents change for each future model (8 per species/group). In this case, a negative number represents a reduction in suitability from the current model into the future, while a positive number represents an increase in suitability from the current model into the future. Finally, we wanted to estimate change in the SDMs only for grid cells with higher suitability scores and therefore more likely to harbor individuals. For the current model and each mean future model (2Â years per species/group), threshold suitability scores were set at 0.6 and 0.8, where all grid cells with a suitability score above the threshold were counted. The current value was subtracted from the future value for each species/group. A negative number represents a reduction in suitability from the current model into the future, while a positive number represents an increase in suitability from the current model into the future.
