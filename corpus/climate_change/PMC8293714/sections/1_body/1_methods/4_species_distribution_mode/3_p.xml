<p>We used the default random test percentage of 25 and sampled 10,000 random background test points. Jackknife partitioning was used for species/groups with a continuous distribution while checkerboard1 partitioning was used to model species/groups with several disjunct distributions (Muscarella et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0057" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). For each species/group, we ran MaxEnt models using several combinations of feature class (L, LQ, H, LQH, LQHP, LQHPT), which determine how predictor variables are transformed, where L = linear, Q = quadratic, H = hinge, P = product, and T = threshold. We also tested three regularization multipliers (1, 2, and 3) for each feature class that was modeled, totaling 18 models per species/group. The best model was chosen using AICc for all following analyses. Using the R package

 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0058" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) for each species/group, where values closer to 0 mean a species has a low niche breadth based on the environmental variables used. Then, we calculated how much the projections across species overlapped (
