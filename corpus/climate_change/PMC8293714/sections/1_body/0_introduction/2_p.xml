<p>Species range distributions shift over evolutionary timescales, both expanding and contracting within the cyclical nature of glaciations and periods of warmth (Pielou, 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0068" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). Given that we are seeing a rapid increase in global temperatures, we might expect species ranges to shift accordingly at a much faster rate than has been observed in the past; this will be even more challenging for species living in mountainous regions, such as the Pacific Northwest (PNW) of the United States (Dobrowski &amp; Parks, 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Many species are predicted to go extinct, though how to predict which species are at the highest risk is still unclear (Urban, 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0092" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Even similar species may have unique responses to similar environmental changes (Rapacciuolo et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0071" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), and in some cases, especially when there are rapid changes to the environment, it will be necessary for species to traverse into new territory, rather than adapt (Bridle &amp; Vines, 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Salamanders may be particularly at risk because temperate amphibians are highly vulnerable to changes in temperature (Gerick et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), while also having limited dispersal capabilities (Ovaska, 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0059" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>; Smith &amp; Green, 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0079" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).
