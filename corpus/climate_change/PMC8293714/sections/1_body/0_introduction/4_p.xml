<p>Current geographic distributions certainly play a role in a species response to climate change and an understanding of the limitations of species will help predict how easily that species may disperse into new territory (Peterman &amp; Semlitsch, 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0064" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Furthermore, projecting the environmental envelope of a species onto future climate models has been used to assess the available habitat and dispersal corridors under climate change for conservation purposes (Esser et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Zellmer et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0106" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0108" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). If a species suitable habitat shrinks with changing conditions, as we expect to be the case in salamanders, they may be at higher risk of extinction (Thomas et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0090" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). For example, Jacobsen et al. (
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) used SDMs to assess the relationship between landscape features and the environment to locations in which
