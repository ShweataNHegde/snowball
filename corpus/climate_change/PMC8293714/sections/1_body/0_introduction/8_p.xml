 <italic toggle="yes">Plethodon dunni</italic> (Bishop, 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">1934</xref>) and 
 <italic toggle="yes">vehiculum</italic> (Cooper, 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">1860</xref>): Both of these sister species have large continuous distributions in OR and WA that cross the Columbia River, with some population genetic structure (Pelletier &amp; Carstens, 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0061" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). They are largely sympatric and diverged from one another approximately 10 mya (Kozak et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). These two species had similar southern ancestral distributions during the LGM, and there is evidence of extensive range expansion in both species, yet 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. vehiculum</italic> was able to expand much farther north than 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. dunni</italic> in the last 20,000 years, even though the effective population size of 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. dunni</italic> grew faster (Pelletier &amp; Carstens, 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0061" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Overall, 
 <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. 
 <italic toggle="yes">vehiculum</italic> has the largest range with very little genetic structure, even onto Vancouver Island (Pelletier et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0063" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), and has a higher tolerance to extremes in temperature and humidity (Dumas, 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">1956</xref>), indicating this species is a good disperser.
