<p>In this study, we have several aims. First, we estimate the species distribution model for each species using climatic data layers. We compare the environmental limitations across species with the expectation that each species will have a unique environmental envelope. This can be particularly useful because it is possible that not all species will respond to climate change similarly (Pucko et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0069" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0108" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Next, we project the current species environmental envelope onto future climate models to gain information about where these species may shift their ranges to overcome the increase in global temperature as this information may inform land‐use policy (Brown &amp; Yoder, 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Wilting et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0105" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In addition to estimating current and future SDMs for each species, we estimate models for clades that include 2–3 closely related species as this can improve niche estimation by taking into account the shared environmental tolerances among evolutionary lineages (Smith et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0078" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Biodiversity can be defined at multiple levels (populations, species, communities) and by considering conservation at more than one level (i.e., not only at the species level), we may come up with conservation strategies that are easier to implement (Marcot, 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0046" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Efforts aimed at conserving phylogenetic diversity rather than focusing on individual species (Faith, 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>) can offer more manageable conservation solutions in defining protected areas (Rosauer et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0072" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).
