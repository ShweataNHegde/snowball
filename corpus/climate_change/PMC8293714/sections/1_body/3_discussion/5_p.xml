<p>Because Plethodontids spend most of their time underground, the ability to assess dispersal in this group is difficult, but it is thought to be limited (Ovaska, 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0059" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>; Smith &amp; Green, 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0079" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Due to their risk of desiccation, open areas are often considered difficult for surface activity in these salamanders; however, studies of their migration in deforested areas as compared to their forested counterparts demonstrated no such limitation (Marsh et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0047" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Additionally, studies exploring both past and contemporary patterns in range expansion suggest salamanders can disperse very long distances, though it varies among individuals and species (Fonte et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Lowe, 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0042" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Pelletier &amp; Carstens, 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0061" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). We suspect that dispersal might be a strong predictor in how these species respond to climate change and that dispersal is not necessarily tied to habitat suitability because landscape features in relation to the resistance of gene flow have been found to vary across geographic areas within a single species of an eastern
