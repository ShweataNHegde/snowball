<p>Alternatively, metapopulations arise within species as a result of limited isolation, a common pattern in salamanders (Smith &amp; Green, 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0079" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), and open areas within forests are a continuing result of deforestation. Continued loss of habitat may result in fragmentation of populations, possibly resulting in species divergence, rather than extinction (Jackson &amp; Sax, 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The species within this group display either a single small distribution, several disjunct distributions, or large distributions with population genetic structure. Similar to its eastern counterparts, western 
 <italic toggle="yes">Plethodon</italic> are highly associated with cool moist montane climates and because of this niche conservatism across species, those that are geographically isolated diverge, a pattern seen many times in eastern 
 <italic toggle="yes">Plethodon</italic> (Kozak &amp; Wiens, 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0040" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). In fact, there are well over five times the number of eastern 
 <italic toggle="yes">Plethodon</italic> salamanders than western 
 <italic toggle="yes">Plethodon</italic> and it is possible that the western 
 <italic toggle="yes">Plethodon</italic> salamanders may follow a similar pattern if they become more restricted to higher elevations. 
 <italic toggle="yes">Plethodon</italic> salamanders have a long history in the United States and have seen increased diversification during warmer time periods (Vieites et al.,
