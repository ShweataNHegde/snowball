<p>Even though climate predictions suggest an increase in temperature in the PNW, we suspect we are not seeing an overall decrease in suitable habitat for most of these species because they are more dependent on precipitation and can spend the hot dry months underground, as is currently demonstrated by the southern species in this group (Bury &amp; Pearl, 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). This is not surprising due to amphibians’ strong association with moist environments (Buckley &amp; Jetz, 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), particularly terrestrial salamanders (Peterman &amp; Semlitsch, 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0064" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Though change in average temperature is often a central focus of climate change research, other variables can be important factors in a species’ ecological niche. These may not be the same for species in similar geographic areas and might be contradictory with the expectations of a warming climate, but the exposure to temperature increases in these species could be minimal (Gade et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Rapacciuolo et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0071" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The extended growing season and potential for an increase in precipitation will likely keep canopy cover high retaining moisture and limiting solar radiation and vapor pressure, which could be beneficial for these salamanders. This is further supported by a study done on a group of eastern Plethodontid salamanders that suggests surface activity may increase under future climate conditions (Gade et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Furthermore, these species breed terrestrially, allowing them freedom from bodies of water, and therefore limiting their dependency on the same environmental cues that would be necessary for pond or stream breeding.
