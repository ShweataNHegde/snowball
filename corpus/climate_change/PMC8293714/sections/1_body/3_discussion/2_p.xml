<p>Protecting biodiversity is a widely accepted concept that results in benefits for humans on many levels (Burch‐Brown &amp; Archer, 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), and the PNW is often considered an area of conservation prioritization (Brooks et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Protections may happen at many levels from populations to communities. Understanding how species will respond to changes in climate will aid planning strategies moving forward, especially given that species responses are not homogeneous (Rapacciuolo et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0071" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Furthermore, focusing on species groups that form a clade and share geographic space can consolidate conservation efforts. In this case, we can consider looking at a group of four responses to climate change, rather than eight separate responses for each species. For example, the 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. dunni‐vehiculum</italic> analysis is likely enough to consider for protecting this lineage. This body of work contributes to a better understanding of a small group of salamanders, which is especially important given recent declines in amphibian populations (Stuart et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0085" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) and limited studies on salamanders that project distributions under future climate scenarios (Zellmer et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0106" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).
