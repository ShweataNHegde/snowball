 <italic toggle="yes">Plethodon dunni</italic> and 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. vehiculum</italic> had the highest niche overlap among any of the pairwise comparisons (0.5579), and also the most overlap with other species (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37735-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). 
 <italic toggle="yes">Plethodon dunni</italic> shared niche space with 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. larselli</italic> (0.2100) and 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. vandykei</italic> (0.2640), similar to 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. vehiculum</italic> sharing niche space with 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. larselli</italic> (0.2254) and 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. vandykei</italic> (0.4923). Of all the species analyzed, 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. vehiculum</italic> had the second highest niche breadth (0.0632), followed by 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. dunni</italic> (0.0382). The 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. dunni‐vehiculum</italic> group future SDM suggests an increase in habitat suitability in most of its current range, except the southern portion of its range and in the valley, and far more suitable habitat in the north (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37735-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Expansion of suitable habitat is clear for this group and both species individually (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37735-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">4</xref>). In 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. dunni,</italic> the southwestern portion of the SDMs is greatly reduced along the Pacific coast but expands largely in the north and in the Cascades (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37735-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S15</xref>). The coastal region from mid‐OR to around the Olympic Peninsula for 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. vehiculum</italic> has the most notable increase in climate suitability (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37735-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S16</xref>). These results coincide with model projections for the mid‐Holocene, when the climate was much warmer, in that suitable habitat for these species was predicted to be larger and more north and coastal (Pelletier &amp; Carstens, 
 <xref rid="ece37735-bib-0061" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Bioclimatic variables 7 (Temperature Annual Range) and 15 (Precipitation Seasonality) were the most important for 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. vehiculum</italic>, while variables 12 (Annual Precipitation) and 14 (Precipitation of the Driest Month) were the most important for 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. dunni</italic>, and 7 (Temperature Annual Range) and 19 (Precipitation of Coldest Quarter) were the most important for their group model (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37735-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref>).
