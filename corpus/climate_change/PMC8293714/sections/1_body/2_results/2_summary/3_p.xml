<p>Niche breadth was small for all species, and SDM overlap was small to moderate (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37735-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). As expected, there is less overlap between the current models and the future models from 2050 to 2070 and from the rcp4.5 to the rcp8.5 scenario, meaning that current models are more similar to year 2050 than 2070, and more similar to rcp4.5 than rcp8.5 (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37735-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). Both the summed and averaged raster layers showed the same pattern (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37735-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>), where most species have an increase of suitable habitat available in the future projections (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37735-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Similarly, the analysis counting grid cells with suitability scores above 0.6 and 0.8 suggests an expansion of suitable habitat from the future projections for most species (Tables 
 <xref rid="ece37735-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ece37735-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>). In general, the MIROC5 models were more restrictive than the CCSM4 models (Tables 
 <xref rid="ece37735-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ece37735-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>) and show more significant differences in the bioclimatic variables into the future (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37735-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref>), indicating that MIROC5 predicts a bigger change in the environment for these salamanders in the PNW. As expected, there is a consistent significant increase in temperature for all species; however, rainfall appears to either stay the same (no significant difference) or increase. This increase is consistent particularly for bioclimatic variables 12 (Annual Precipitation), 13 (Precipitation of the Wettest Month), 16 (Precipitation of the Wettest Quarter), and 19 (Precipitation of the Coldest Quarter).
