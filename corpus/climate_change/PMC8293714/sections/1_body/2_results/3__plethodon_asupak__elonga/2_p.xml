 <italic toggle="yes">Plethodon elongatus</italic> and 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. stormi</italic> had little niche overlap in their SDMs (0.0905), and although both small, the niche breadth for 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. stormi</italic> (0.0062) was half that 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. elongatus</italic> (0.0136) (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37735-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). This group showed the smallest combined range of any other group (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37735-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), but was similar in size to 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. idahoensis</italic>. The future SDM suggests a shift in habitat to the coast and out of the valley and a move north into the mountains. Overall, there appears to be more suitable habitat available for this group, except for 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. stormi</italic> (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37735-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">4</xref>). A similar pattern for 
 <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. 
 <italic toggle="yes">elongatus</italic> alone is observed, and this species could potentially travel north along the coast (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37735-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10</xref>). The 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. stormi</italic> model shows a string of suitable habitat along the Cascade and Sierra Nevada Mountain Ranges, and this string is pronounced in the future model (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37735-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11</xref>). Bioclimatic variable 15 (Precipitation Seasonality) consistently came out as being the most important to the models for all species in this group, followed by 12 (Annual Precipitation), 14 (Precipitation of the Driest Month), and 17 (Precipitation at the Driest Quarter) (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37735-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref>).
