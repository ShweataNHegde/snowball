 <italic toggle="yes">Plethodon idahoensis</italic> had little niche overlap with both 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. larselli</italic> (0.0082) and 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. vandykei</italic> (0.0069), while the niche overlap between the coastal species 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. larselli</italic> and 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. vandykei</italic> was much higher (0.1949) (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37735-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). All three species had low niche breadth with 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. idahoensis</italic> being the highest in this group and overall (0.0744), followed by 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. vandykei</italic> (0.0240), then 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. larselli</italic> (0.0094). Overall, in the 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. larselli‐vandykei</italic> group, SDMs suggests more highly suitable habitat in the Cascades over the Coastal Mountains and expansion of suitable habitat in the North (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37735-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>); however, this is likely driven by 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. larselli,</italic> as 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. vandykei</italic> suitable habitat is expected to shrink (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37735-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">4</xref>). For 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. larselli,</italic> the future SDMs show an expansion in suitable habitat in all directions as far north as Vancouver and as far south as northern CA (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37735-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12</xref>), while 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. vandykei</italic> suitable habitat is severely restricted to small patches in the Cascade Mountains and Olympic Peninsula (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37735-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S13</xref>). The SDMs of 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. idahoensis</italic> indicate a shift in suitable habitat to the northeast and encompasses a larger area (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37735-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Interestingly, even though 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. idahoensis</italic> expands its range of suitable habitat, suitability scores are low, as demonstrated by an increase in summed suitability but a decrease in average suitability and the threshold grid cell counts. Additionally, the combined model for these three species shows an increase in suitable habitat around its entire distribution (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37735-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S14</xref>), but we do not consider this a suitable analysis as there is no overlap in distribution between 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. idahoensis</italic> and 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. larselli</italic> or 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. vandykei</italic>. 
 <italic toggle="yes">Plethodon idahoensis</italic> in general displays much less continuous suitable habitat and shows little niche overlap with the other two species. Bioclimatic variable 12 (Annual Precipitation) followed by 15 (Precipitation Seasonality) consistently came out as being the most important to the models for both 
 <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. 
 <italic toggle="yes">larselli</italic> and 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. vandykei</italic>, while several temperature variables were almost equally important for 
 <italic toggle="yes">P. idahoensis</italic> (9: Mean Temperature of the Driest Quarter; 8: Mean Temperature of the Wettest Quarter; 4: Temperature Seasonality; 7: Temperature Annual Range) (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37735-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref>).
