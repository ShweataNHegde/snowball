We incorporated several greenhouse scenarios both on a species-by-species basis, and also using phylogenetic groups, with the aim to determine the best course of action in managing land area to conserve diversity in this group.<h4>Location</h4>Pacific Northwest of the United States (northern CA, OR, WA, ID, and MT).<h4>Major taxa studied</h4>Western <i>Plethodon</i> salamanders.<h4>Methods</h4>Species distribution models were estimated using MaxEnt for the current time period and for several future climate scenarios using bioclimatic data layers. We used several methods to quantify the change in habitat suitability over time from the models. We explored aspects of the climate layers to determine whether we can expect a concerted response to climate change due to similarity in ecological niche or independent responses that could be harder to manage.<h4>Results</h4>The distribution of western <i>Plethodon</i> salamander species is strongly influenced by precipitation and less so by temperature. Species responses to climate change resulted in both increases and decreases in predicted suitable habitat, though most species ranges do not contract, especially when taken as a phylogenetic group.<h4>Main conclusions</h4>While some established habitats may become more or less climatically suitable, the overall distribution of species in this group is unlikely to be significantly affected. Clades of <i>Plethodon</i> species are unlikely to be in danger of extirpation despite the possibility that individual species may be threatened as a result of limited distributions.
