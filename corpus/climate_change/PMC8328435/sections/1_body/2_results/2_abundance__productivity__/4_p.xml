<p>Mean adult survival rate (age 1+) was high (0.878; 95% CRI 0.827, 0.921), and though adult survival rate was generally stable, annual point estimates were more variable over the past 10 years of the study (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37873-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37873-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Mean apparent first‐year survival rate was 0.290 but annual estimates were variable, and precision was low (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37873-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Mean breeding propensity of 2‐year‐old females was 0.359, which is consistent with estimates from other eider species (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37873-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Average probability of nest success was 0.778 but highly variable across years with significant declines in 2001 and 2013 (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37873-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). Average clutch size at hatch was 4.297 with 95% CRI between 3.06 and 5.82 (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37873-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Because fecundity (
 <italic toggle="yes">f</italic>) was derived from the product of nest success, clutch size, and duckling survival (a constant), the values varied over time primarily in response to changes in nest success (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37873-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) and fecundity and nest success probability were highly correlated (
 <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0.93, Pearson's correlation coefficient).
