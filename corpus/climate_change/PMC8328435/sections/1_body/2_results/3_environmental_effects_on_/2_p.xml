<p>The number of extreme sea ice days (days with ≥95% sea ice cover) on the core wintering area fluctuated between 16 and 101 days over the study period (1992–2014). Only one year (winter 2001) within the study period had a particularly low number of extreme sea ice days (16 days ≥95% ice cover; November 2000 – April 2001) which coincided with the lowest annual estimates of adult survival rate and nest success probability.</p>
