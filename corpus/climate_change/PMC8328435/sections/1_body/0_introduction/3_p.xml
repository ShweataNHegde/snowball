<p>While environmental conditions in the Arctic are changing and reshaping ecosystems, the degree to which these changes affect the population dynamics of individual Arctic species is dependent upon their life‐history strategies. Adaptation to rapid climate change is likely to be difficult for long‐lived and highly specialized species making them particularly vulnerable (Berteaux et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37873-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Frequently, life‐histories of long‐lived organisms have evolved to buffer some demographic rates from environmental variation (Koons et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37873-bib-0050" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Pfister, 
 <xref rid="ece37873-bib-0069" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Saether &amp; Bakke, 
 <xref rid="ece37873-bib-0076" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). For instance, in long‐lived species, adult survival is often resilient to stochastic annual variations in environmental conditions. However, interannual variation and directional changes in environmental conditions that exceed historical bounds may influence these demographic rates with important consequences for population dynamics and extinction risk (Schmutz,
