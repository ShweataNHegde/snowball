<p>The Arctic is undergoing rapid and accelerating change in response to global warming. Changes in the abiotic environment have considerably altered biodiversity patterns and ecosystem function across the region (Eamer et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37873-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Drastic and unprecedented changes in biotic and abiotic processes have had strong and complex impacts on Arctic species including changes in distribution, abundance, extinction risk, and trophic interactions (Macias‐Fauria &amp; Post, 
 <xref rid="ece37873-bib-0062" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Yet, population responses to climate change remain a critical knowledge gap for many Arctic species (Laidre et al.,
