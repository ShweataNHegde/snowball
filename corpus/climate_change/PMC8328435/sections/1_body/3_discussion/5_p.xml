<p>Eiders are capital breeders and thus rely on energy stores acquired prior to breeding for sustenance during the incubation period. Females can lose 26% of their body mass during incubation (Flint &amp; Grand, 
 <xref rid="ece37873-bib-0555" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). Arriving at the breeding grounds in poor condition may force females to increase the frequency and duration of incubation recesses to feed, potentially exposing nests to harsh environmental conditions or increased predation risk and resulting in total or partial nest failure (Criscuolo et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37873-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; D'Alba et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37873-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Iles et al.,

Furthermore, females in poor body condition may abandon their nests at higher rates, in favor of survival and reproduction in the following year. Nest success is estimated to be highest between 60 and 80 ice days, indicating that nest success may be more sensitive to winter sea ice conditions than adult survival. This is consistent with a life‐history trade‐off between survival and reproductive success for long‐lived iteroparous species such as eiders (Orzack &amp; Tuljapurkar,
