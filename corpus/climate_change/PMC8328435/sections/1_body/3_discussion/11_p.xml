<p>Changes in sea ice persistence may have important effects on spectacled eider diets and range dynamics that compound the deleterious effects predicted by our results. Declines in sea ice concentrations in the Bering Sea are expected to affect the benthic faunal composition and biomass that supports the marine ecosystem and provides food for Arctic marine predators (Grebmeier,

 <xref rid="ece37873-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Furthermore, projected changes in sea ice will increase the duration and extent of open water periods, likely altering the spatial distribution of suitable refugia and affecting the spatial structure of benthic communities (Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37873-bib-0095" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Since the 1990s spectacled eiders have shifted their molting distribution, likely in response to changing ecosystem conditions (Sexson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37873-bib-0086" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). How spectacled eiders adapt (e.g., prey switching, range shifts) in response to sea ice loss throughout their wintering habitat remains to be seen. Further research on adaptations to changing sea ice conditions will be critical for understanding spectacled eider's short and long‐term responses to climate change.
