<p>Understanding Arctic species demographic responses to environmental conditions has become increasingly important in a changing climate. Using the integrated population modeling approach, we were able to identify limiting factors affecting population growth via different demographic rates throughout the annual cycle. We believe this study provides further evidence of the importance of long‚Äêterm demographic studies to identify demographic responses to climate change and identify opportunities for conservation action.</p>
