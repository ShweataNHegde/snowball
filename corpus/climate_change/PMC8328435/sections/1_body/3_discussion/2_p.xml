<p>We investigated the full annual cycle population dynamics of spectacled eiders using an integrated population model and found that the climatic conditions experienced during the wintering period affect both adult survival and nest success (Figures 
 <xref rid="ece37873-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4b</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ece37873-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). Previous research identified a similar relationship between adult survival and winter sea ice (Christie et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37873-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>); however, conditions outside of the breeding season were never considered in analyses of reproductive success (Flint et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37873-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Integrating data on multiple demographic rates provided us with additional information on important demographic processes that influence population dynamics. Specifically, we were able to estimate mean breeding propensity for 2‐year‐old females and annual survival of first‐year birds, quantities that were not estimable using any of the data streams independently. Among the parameters that were allowed to vary over time, we determined that annual variation in female population growth was largely influenced by first‐year survival, demonstrating additional benefits of using an integrated modeling approach.
