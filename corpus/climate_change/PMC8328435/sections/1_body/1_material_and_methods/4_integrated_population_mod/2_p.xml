<p>We developed an integrated population model (IPM) to describe spectacled eider breeding population dynamics for the YKD using annual estimates of abundance from aerial surveys of the entire YKD breeding population and demographic data collected from Kigigak Island from 1992 to 2014. The IPM unified the analysis of aerial survey data on breeding abundance (includes males and females), capture–mark–recapture data (CMR; females only), and productivity data including clutch size at hatch, nest success (1 or more ducklings hatched), and a constant duckling survival rate. Aerial survey data include all relevant information to describe change in abundance over time. CMR data were used to inform age‐specific survival and breeding propensity of 2‐year‐old females. Productivity data were used to inform recruitment of female spectacled eiders into the breeding population.</p>
