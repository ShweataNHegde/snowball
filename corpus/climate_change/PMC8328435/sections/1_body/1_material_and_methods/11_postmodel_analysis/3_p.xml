<p>We report both population growth rates because they can be used for different purposes. Spectacled eiders are monitored as breeding populations, which includes paired males and females of breeding age, and population growth rate of the breeding population is relevant for conservation and policy planning. We were also interested in assessing the relative contribution of each demographic rate to the realized variation in total female population growth rate. Due to delayed breeding, neither nest success nor first‐year survival directly contribute to the change in breeding abundance within that year. Thus, we calculated the correlation coefficient between each demographic rate and total female population growth. We used the full posterior sample and calculated the probability that the correlations were positive
