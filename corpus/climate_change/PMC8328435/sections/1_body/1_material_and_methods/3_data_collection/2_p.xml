<p>Aerial surveys of spectacled eiders have been conducted on 12,832 km
 <sup>2</sup> of YKD tundra wetland habitat annually since 1988 (Fischer et al.,

 <xref rid="ece37873-bib-0070" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Ground‐based surveys have been conducted annually on the YKD since 1985 to estimate the numbers of nests for geese and eiders. These ground‐based surveys sample randomly selected plots within the core nesting area of spectacled eiders in the central coast zone, encompassing 716 km
 <sup>2</sup> (Fischer et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37873-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Eider density varies widely across the YKD with low densities throughout most of the region. Lewis et al. (
 <xref rid="ece37873-bib-0056" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) identified three density‐specific strata: low‐density (0–1.60 nest/km), medium‐density (1.60–3.50 nests/km), and high‐density (&gt;3.50 nests/km). Estimates of nests and aerial observations among low, medium, and high‐density strata on the YKD were used to calculate density‐specific aerial visibility correction factors (VCF) to account for incomplete detection on the aerial surveys. The average density‐specific visibility correction factors were used to convert indices of eider abundance to annual estimates of breeding spectacled eiders and variance (Lewis et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37873-bib-0056" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Both the estimates of average number of breeding pairs and the annual variance are included as data in the count sub‐model (described below).
