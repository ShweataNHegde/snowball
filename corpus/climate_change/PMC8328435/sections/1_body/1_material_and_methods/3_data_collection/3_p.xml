<p>On the YKD, survival and productivity studies were carried out on Kigigak Island (60°50’N, 165°50’W) between 1992 and 2015 following protocols established by Grand and Flint (

 <xref rid="ece37873-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). At Kigigak Island, nest searches began in late May and continued through mid‐June. Adult females were captured on nests and given stainless steel leg bands, numbered plastic leg bands, and nasal disks. In some years, brood hens were marked with radio transmitters and monitored to estimate duckling survival (0 – 30 days). At approximately 30 days posthatch, ducklings were captured and marked with stainless steel and plastic bands. Individuals may be marked as 30‐day‐old ducklings or as breeding adults on the breeding grounds. Most marked birds were adults and thus classified as breeding age. Immature and nonbreeding 2‐year‐olds do not come to the breeding grounds and are thus unobservable. Only birds marked as ducklings were of known age upon recapture.
