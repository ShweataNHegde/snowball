<p>The descriptions of the model likelihoods and parameters above describe a model that accounted for temporal variation in demographic rates but did not include covariates. Here, we describe the environmental factors across the full annual cycle that we expected to be important influences on demographic change and how they were included in the final model structure. We were particularly interested in understanding how deviations from average sea ice conditions during the “wintering period” (defined as November 1 – April 30) would affect demographic rates. We predicted that nest success and survival of adult females would be affected by sea ice conditions during the wintering period, with lower survival and nest success in years with extreme high or low sea ice cover for reasons described in our introduction. Though breeding propensity of 2‐year‐olds might also be influenced by winter sea ice conditions, we did not have sufficient data to allow breeding propensity to vary over time. The Arctic Oscillation is an index used to describe the pattern of variation in winter sea‐level atmospheric pressure that has been correlated with changes in Arctic climate (Aanes et al.,
