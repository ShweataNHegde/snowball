<p>The coastal plain of the YKD is one of the largest and most productive waterfowl breeding areas in North America. The YKD is predominately flat tundra and wetlands interspersed with small ponds, lakes, rivers, and tidal sloughs. Spectacled eiders typically arrive on the breeding grounds in late May; males depart 1–2 weeks after incubation begins, and females and their young leave for the wintering grounds in late August. Studies have identified strong breeding and molting site fidelity, important geographical locations, and broad spatiotemporal patterns of spectacled eider site use throughout the annual cycle (Lovvorn et al.,

Following the wintering period, individuals previously marked on the YKD either staged along the coast of the Chukotka Peninsula, in Norton Sound, or on the YKD prior to the breeding period (Sexson et al.,
