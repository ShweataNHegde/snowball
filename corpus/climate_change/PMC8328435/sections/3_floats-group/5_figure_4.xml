  <p>Estimates of annual adult survival of female spectacled eiders (age 1+) breeding on the Yukon‐Kuskokwim Delta in western Alaska (a) and response curves showing the effect of extreme sea ice days (number of days with sea ice concentrations &gt;95%) over the core wintering area on survival of adult female spectacled eiders (b). (a) Black circles and dashed vertical lines are the annual means and 95% Bayesian credible interval estimates from the integrated population model. Annual estimates were generally high and became more variable in the last decade. (b) Black line and gray band are the mean and 95% Bayesian credible interval of the response curve and black circles are the posterior mean estimates of adult survival from the integrated population model. Adult survival is highest in years with intermediate sea ice conditions (50–90 days with extreme sea ice concentrations) and declines with more extreme ice conditions</p>
