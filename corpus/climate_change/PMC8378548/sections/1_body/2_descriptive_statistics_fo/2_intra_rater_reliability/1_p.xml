<p>As each participant's image list contained a repeated image, intra-rater reliability was assessed by examining the consistency with which they rated this repeated image for each of the variables (relevance, arousal, and valence). Raters' evaluation seemed to be consistent for all variables with no significant statistical difference in ratings [relevance: 
 <italic>t</italic>(210) = 1.817, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.071; arousal: 
 <italic>t</italic>(210) = −0.898, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.370; valence: 
 <italic>t</italic>(210) = −0.43, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.668].
