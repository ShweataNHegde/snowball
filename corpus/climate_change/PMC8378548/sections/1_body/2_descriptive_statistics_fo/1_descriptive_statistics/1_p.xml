<p>The descriptive statistical analysis is based on the 201 original images from our searches, leaving the 3 common ones dedicated to the practice session as well as the 100 images from Lehman et al.'s 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref> database aside. The mean rating of each variable (relevance, arousal, and valence) was collected for each image, and we present in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> images distribution (share) according to relevance to CC and emotional valence ratings (&lt;4; 4â€“6; &gt; 6).
