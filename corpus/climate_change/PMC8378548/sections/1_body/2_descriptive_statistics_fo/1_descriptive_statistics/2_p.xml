<p>Preliminary results show that the means relevance scores of the 201 images (
 <italic>M</italic> = 6.653, 
 <italic>SD</italic> = 1.169) were positively correlated with the means image arousal ratings (
 <italic>M</italic> = 5.941, 
 <italic>SD</italic> = 1.032), 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.731, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001. The correlation indicates that the images assessed as most relevant to CC were also assessed as very exciting (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The mean relevance ratings also displayed a negative correlation with the mean valence ratings (
 <italic>M</italic> = 3.867, 
 <italic>SD</italic> = 1.389), 
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.644, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001. The correlation shows that the images rated as highly relevant to CC tended to also be rated as low valence (i.e., very negative) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). There was also a strong negative correlation between the mean arousal scores and the mean valence scores of the images, 
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.849, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, showing that the images rated as most exciting were also among the most negative (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).
