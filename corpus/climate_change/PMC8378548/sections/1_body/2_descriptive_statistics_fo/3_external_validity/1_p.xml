<p>In order to examine the external validity of our ratings, we now focus on the correlations with the ratings for the 100 images used from Lehman et al.'s 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref> database. Pearson's correlations were performed and showed that our relevance ratings for the images and those of Lehman et al. (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) seemed to be highly positively correlated, 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.888, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, as are the average valence ratings, 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.923, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, which means that the ratings reported within our French student population very slightly differ from those reported within the American student population in Lehman et al. (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The arousal average assessment is, to a lesser extent, also positively correlated 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.433, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001. This distinction is consistent with previous research showing greater variability for arousal than for valence ratings (Eilola and Havelka, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Monnier and Syssau, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). To conclude, these preliminary results show a potential good external validity.
