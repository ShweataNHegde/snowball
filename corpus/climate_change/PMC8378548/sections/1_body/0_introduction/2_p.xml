<p>Imagery related to climate change (CC) has been widely used for communication, research, and even advertising (Trumbo, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Moser, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Pezzullo and Cox, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). As the representation of CC seems to vary from one individual to another, imagery is very important to ensure that messages concerning CC are effectively communicated by experts, especially in a society where visual images predominate in all forms of media and communication (Nicholson-Cole, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Lehman et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Indeed, Leiserowitz (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) argues that Americans' stated responses to questions about CC are strongly influenced by imagery, combined with affect and values. However, although CC communication should “address cognition, affect, and behavior, without reinforcing a sense of fatalism and disengagement” (Manzo, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), to our best knowledge no study has looked at the level of relevance to CC of the imagery used, as well as its emotional value within a population, except the Lehman et al.'s 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref> original database, which is American-based.
