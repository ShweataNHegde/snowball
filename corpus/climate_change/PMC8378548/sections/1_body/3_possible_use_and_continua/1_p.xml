<p>The FAICC database provides ongoing research material for researchers who are interested in imagery and its implications for CC. Some of the possible uses of a set of emotional images relevant to climate change are, for example, advertising or scientific research, in which this material can be used to observe the impact of emotional images on attitudes or even a commitment to the environmental cause. The FAICC database is relevant in the French context, and by extension at the European-scale. This material could be used in comparative studies and cross-cultural studies. Along with a cultural distinction analysis in ratings, it may be interesting to investigate other cultural features (e.g., high-income vs. middle- and low-income countries, or natural hazards exposure of the populations), as well as possible generational distinctions in the visual perception of climate change.</p>
