<p>The image-rating task was designed using OpenSesame software (version 3.2.5 -
 <italic>Kafkaesque Koffka</italic>- Mathôt et al., 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and followed exactly the same procedure as Lehman et al. (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Each participant was individually seated in front of a computer in a laboratory room. After filling out a consent form, participants were told that they were going to be shown images on the computer screen and were instructed to rate their personal reaction with regards to each image. Images were displayed above a question and a 9-point Likert scale (rating scale of 1–9): participants were asked how irrelevant or relevant each image was to CC (relevance), how calming or exciting it made them feel (arousal), and how the emotion evoked by the image is rather negative (unpleasant) or positive (pleasant) (valence), consistently in that order. Each image was appraised for each of the three variables before the next image was displayed, in a random order for each participant—relevance scale: 1. not relevant/9. relevant; arousal scale: 1. calm/9. excited; valence scale: 1. negative/9. positive. Participants used the numeric keypad on the computer keyboard to assign scores.
