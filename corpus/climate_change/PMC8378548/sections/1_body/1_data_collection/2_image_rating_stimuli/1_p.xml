<p>204 images were gathered from Google searches. We used the French translations of terms used by Lehman et al. (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>): (1) “
 <italic>changement climatique</italic>” (climate change), (2) “
 <italic>causes du changement climatique</italic>” (climate change causes), (3) “
 <italic>impacts du changement climatique</italic>” (climate change impacts), and (4) “
 <italic>solutions au changement climatique</italic>” (climate change solutions), and we selected the top images—these are the images that came up first in our google searches according to our selection criteria, with a satisfactory format and royalty free—, resulting in 237 images. Some images belonged to different categories and appeared in different searches, so we removed redundancies (
 <italic>n</italic> = 33), then resulting in 204 images.
