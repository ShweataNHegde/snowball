<p>Since Google searches consider the geographical location of the searches (Cooper et al., 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">In press</xref>), we did not find any common images with Lehman et al.'s 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref> database. As a consequence, in order to examine the external validity of our ratings, 100 images were added from Lehman et al.'s 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref> database: the 32 most and the 32 least relevant images to CC with regards to the average relevance ratings, as well as 36 images randomly selected which were neither relevant nor irrelevant to CC.
