<p>The negative effects of extreme weather events and high solar radiation in crops urge short-term adaptation strategies. Careful clone selection has been employed to select the more performant varieties in response to extreme temperatures, allowing to minimize damages. Furthermore, protective substances, such as foliar sprays have been developed. In the case of chestnut species, silicon has been studied to protect the plant from extreme events. Silicon is recognized as a fertilizer, bio-stimulating plant protection under environmental stress, which activates the plant’s latent tolerance mechanisms [

More specifically, silicon plays an important structural and protective role in the plant’s protection, with low energy costs due to the increase in the rigidity and abrasiveness (increase in the resistance of xylem vessels to drought and heat) of the vegetal tissues [

Additionally, Boron is a plant compound that is affected by warmer temperatures and rainfall. According to [
