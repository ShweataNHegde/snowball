<p>Other investigations indicated that the selection of the type of irrigation system considers several factors, such as water availability and its purity, soil permeability and its water storage capacity, topography, product value, labor costs, energy costs, capital, and technology requirements [

 <xref rid="B43-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], comparing the 2 systems, the drip system is less productive and less expensive compared to the micro-sprinkles system. According to [
 <xref rid="B72-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], the drip system is the distribution of water to the crops that makes use of the most advanced principles of irrigation. Instead, Regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) and Partial Rootzone Drying (PRD) can be a new way of optimizing crop water use efficiency. Deficit irrigation may be considered a sustainable management option at the present conditions, by reducing irrigation requirements and increasing crop water use efficiency, this technique may save 30% water with the same yield as full irrigation [

 <xref rid="B72-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. The RDI strategy uses the knowledge of the crop response to water stress at different phenological phases to identify the periods when fruit trees are less sensitive [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The PRD is alternate drip irrigation, with both sides of the root zone irrigated alternatively with half the water. Moreover, different sources of water may be used too to promote water management, such as treated wastewater and saline water.
