<p>Irrigation is an efficient option to promote species hydration and is a suitable climate change adaptation strategy, while the implementation of an irrigation system brings new costs to companies, which growers should take into account [

 <xref rid="B43-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], irrigation application based on tree water potential is enough to increase the chestnut production per tree. Furthermore, the fertigation system, i.e., a combination of irrigation and fertilization, can enhance the irrigation of plants, enhance plant nutritional status and chestnut quality. Refs. [

 <xref rid="B75-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] confirmed that irrigation is a factor that promotes the production, given that chestnut production was 22–37% higher in irrigated trees compared to non-irrigated trees. Moreover, some studies have documented the effect of irrigation on the chestnut’s size index, fruit weight, or production per tree. As reported by [
 <xref rid="B43-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], irrigation increases the commercial value of the chestnuts, specifically, increase its size keeping their nutritional value and sensory characteristics (fruit size, firmness, tastiness, and sweetness), did not negatively affect the chemical composition of the chestnut.
