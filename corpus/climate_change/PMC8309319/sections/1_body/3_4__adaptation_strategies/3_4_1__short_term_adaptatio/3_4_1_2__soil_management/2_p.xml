<p>Alternatively, the adoption of cover crops is a promising soil and water conservation practice for the cropâ€™s areas. In general, cover crops that can enhance soil organic carbon is of special interest in these systems, as it can help to build resilience for climate change adaptation while contributing to mitigate global warming through the sequestration of atmospheric carbon [
 <xref rid="B77-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. The cover crop rises the surface roughness, reduces the shear stress of runoff, reduces raindrop splash, enhances soil water infiltration, uptake of atmospheric carbon, and fixation in soil, thus increasing the soil organic carbon [
