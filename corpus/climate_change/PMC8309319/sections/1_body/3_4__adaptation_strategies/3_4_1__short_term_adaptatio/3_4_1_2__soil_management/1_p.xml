<p>Over time, the soil has shown some degradation due to cover crop management and climate change, such as soil erosion, reduced soil fertility water demand by crops. As reported by [
 <xref rid="B70-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], climate changes will increase the water demand by crops (40â€“250%), contributing to rising unpredictability for the future accessibility of freshwater. To solve soil water restrictions with adaptation measure is essential, so it is suggested to increase the water retention capacity in the soil, with an application of mulching (can be combined with the application of pruning residues and agroindustry wastes) that reduced evaporation from the bares soils and protect soil erosion [
