<p>As said before, the risks of the proliferation of new pests and diseases have increased with climate change and it is necessary to reduce the impacts caused on production. As an adaptation measure, the development and introduction of resistant or less-susceptible crop varieties. Pesticide application should be carefully considered, taking into account the potential impacts on water quality. Silicon also was used to protect the chestnut tree against pathological fungi which attack leaves, roots, and stems. Ref. [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] conducted a study in which they analyze the influence of silicon on chestnut plants infected with 
 <italic>C. parasitica</italic>, which showed that silicon fertilization can reduce the disease severity and the mortality rate of chestnut plants. Ref. [
 <xref rid="B80-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] also realized another study in which they analyze the influence of silicon on chestnut plants infected with 
 <italic>P. cinnamomi</italic> and confirmed that phenolic extracts from the plants treated with different silicon concentrations have antifungal activity when exposed to bacteria.
