<p>In Europe, rainfall deficit and extreme summer heat can lead to a severe reduction in nut productivity, and in this case, the development of new chestnut cultivars that promote genetic diversity is a sustainable option to promote the local original permanence of the species [

Quinoa has a significant potential for increased production as a new cultivated crop in the Mediterranean region and other areas of the world including North America, Europe, and Asia, also the cultures bean, chickpea, lentil, nigella, camelina, chia, and linseed show potential interest in the yield in the Mediterranean [
