<p>Climate change has influenced the development of plant species, especially chestnut trees at phenological, physiological, biodiversity, and genetic levels. As much as the biodiversity of the chestnut tree is a key factor for the survival and maintenance of the species and the plant reveals acclimatization characteristics, this will not be enough to overcome the new challenges. The development of future climate projections based on feasible future socio-economic storylines provides objective information that can be used in developing suitable adaptation management. In the case of chestnuts, short- and long-term adaptation measures will have to be applied, such as irrigation and/or the application of protective compounds, which have been studied as a means to reduce the implications of climate change. The adaptation potential of the different strategies to cope with climate change impacts is still unclear but is expected that they can be highly beneficial for the agricultural sector, minimizing climate change impacts on the environment and human activities. Effectively, to keep a stable chestnut sector, investment on the part of the farmers, in addition to government support, is necessary.</p>
