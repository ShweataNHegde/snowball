<p>The recent climate trends are expected to strengthen in future decades [
 <xref rid="B58-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. To assess future climate impacts, multiple climate models (ensembles) are commonly used [

 <xref rid="B55-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), these models are driven by likely future scenarios also known as Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) [
 <xref rid="B61-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The projections follow a set of greenhouse gas concentration and emissions pathways designed to support research on impacts and potential policy responses to climate change [

 <xref rid="B62-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The climate change scenarios can be useful for analyzing agricultural changes due to the increased greenhouse gas emissions and corresponding climate change [
 <xref rid="B24-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Four emission scenarios are usually used, ranging from the less severe to the most severe scenario (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0, and RCP 8.5). The RCP 8.5 scenario corresponds to the pathway with the highest greenhouse gas emissions, while the RCP 4.5 is a stabilization scenario and adopts that climate policies, in this instance the introduction of a set of global greenhouse gas emissions prices, are invoked to achieve the goal of limiting emissions and radiative forcing (4.5 W m

 <xref rid="B63-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. These scenarios predict a global mean surface temperature increase, of 2.6 °C or 4.8 °C, for RCP 4.5 or RCP 8.5, respectively [

 <xref rid="B24-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], all scenarios showed a decrease in European agricultural land by 2080. Another study assessed the climate change impacts on the physiological conditions of chestnut trees under RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 [
 <xref rid="B3-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. For RCP 2.6, important risks of loss of ecosystems, and their associated functions, will first appear in the south of the Iberian Peninsula and, at an advanced, the stage chestnut ecosystem will begin a survival phase in the same region. For the RCP8.5 scenario, the risk will be especially high in the Mediterranean areas of Southern and Central Spain, and at a later stage, conditions are projected to surpass the chestnut survival threshold.
