<p>Recent studies indicated that climate change is affecting the agricultural systems very differently in different parts of Europe. In most European areas, heatwaves and droughts are very likely to increase in frequency, intensity, and duration [

In Southern Europe, higher temperature and recurrent droughts are projected to worsen conditions in a region already vulnerable to climate variability and change, lowering harvestable yields, increase yield variability, and reduce in areas for traditional crops [
