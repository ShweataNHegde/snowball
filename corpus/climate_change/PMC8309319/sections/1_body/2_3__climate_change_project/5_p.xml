<p>Given that cultivation of chestnut trees for fruit production is mainly concentrated in Southern Europe, more specifically in the Mediterranean Basin, climate change may represent an important threat [

 <xref rid="B25-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In some cases, warmer temperatures may bring some benefits, such as increased productivity, with accelerating fruit ripening, provoking the early harvests [

 <xref rid="B25-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Additionally, air temperature is strongly associated with the radial growth of tree stems, being the maximum growth rate correlated with both temperature and day length maximum [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. On the other hand, insufficient chill accumulation may low fruit set, with detrimental consequences on yields [

 <xref rid="B25-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. On other occasions, the upward temperature trends may reduce water availability and decreases chilling conditions. Water stress may result in a wide range of negative impacts, such as a low flower-setting and fruit-setting, low leaf area, limited photosynthesis, flower abortion, and cluster abscission [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Further, warmer climate conditions are more favorable to the proliferation of insect pests [
 <xref rid="B24-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Low humidity and high temperature protect plants from fungal diseases. It will be necessary to adapt to new climatic conditions, e.g., through varietal selection, modifications in sowing dates, changes in fertilization, or pesticide applications [
 <xref rid="B24-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Water and heat stress lessen plant growth and less vigor, also increasing susceptibility to biotic factors such as ink and blight diseases [
 <xref rid="B29-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. For some insect species, such as 
 <italic>Mesopolobus tibialis</italic>, the population doubled when exposed to simulations of sudden stress events due to the cold temperatures (adaptive capacity) [
