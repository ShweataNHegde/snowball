 <italic>Castanea sativa</italic> Mill. revealed different patterns of variation in phenotypic expression after cultivation in two different water regimes, with 50% and 90% substrate saturation. They concluded that the restricted water supply reduces plant water potential in terms of both height and weight, the root development increased, whilst leaf area decreased and modified the leaf morphology.
