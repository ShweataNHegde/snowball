<p>The chestnut species has a good capacity for dynamic colonization, associated with large adaptability, resulting from their genetic and physiological characteristics [

 <xref rid="B27-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Geographical parameters, such as latitude and elevation play an important role in chestnut tree cultivation. This cultivation is roughly within the latitude belt from the 27° N (Canary Islands, Spain) to the 53° N (south of the United Kingdom, UK) parallel [

 <xref rid="B28-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In Southern Europe, there are different elevations with environmental conditions suitable for chestnut development, from high-altitude terrains (e.g., at 1600 m in the Sierra Nevada, Spain) to low-land coastal areas, where thermal amplitudes are relatively low [

 <xref rid="B30-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The photosynthetic rate is strongly affected by the geographical location, the maximum photosynthetic rates can be found above 800 m, with optimal temperatures in the interval of 22–29 °C for the activity in adult trees [
