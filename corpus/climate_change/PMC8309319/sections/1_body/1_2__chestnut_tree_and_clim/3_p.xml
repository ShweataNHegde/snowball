<p>Chestnut is a mesophilic species from warm temperate climates since the best conditions for its growth are moderate temperature and humidity [

 <xref rid="B31-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] Additionally, chestnut is a moderate thermophilic species well adapted to ecosystems with an annual mean temperature ranging between 8–15 °C, and monthly mean temperatures during its vegetative cycle over 6–8 °C [

 <xref rid="B37-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. It tolerates a wide range of climatic conditions, varying from cool and wet conditions in the Atlantic bioclimatic region, to warm and dry conditions in the Mediterranean bioclimatic region [
 <xref rid="B3-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Cooler regions associated with nut crops present values of 60,000 growing degree hours (GDH) [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The chestnut tree tolerates well maximum temperatures up to 27–31 °C and endures absolute minimum temperatures of as low as –16 °C and adapts to the environment with monthly mean temperatures over 10 °C, during at least 6 months [

 <xref rid="B31-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Nevertheless, pollen germination only occurs when temperatures reach 27–30 °C [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Being that the degree-days (° D) are the sum of the temperature with a base temperature of 6 °C, it is generally accepted that chestnut regions must have 1900–2400° D between May and October [
