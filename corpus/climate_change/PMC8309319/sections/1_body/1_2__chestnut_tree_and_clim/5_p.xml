<p>Precipitation also represents a key factor for chestnut growth. It is generally accepted that there is wide chestnut plasticity, illustrated by a wide range of precipitation levels between 600 and 1600 mm [

On the other hand, the length of the drought period is identified as one of the main climatic limitations for chestnut growth, as it might be severely constrained when more than two consecutive months of drought occur, which is indeed very common in Mediterranean-type climates [

The reduction in precipitation promotes soil water deficits and plant water stress, affecting plant growth and development, leading to the production of smaller organs hampering flower production and grain filling, and limiting the size and number of individual leaves [

 <xref rid="B42-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The reduction in grain filling occurs due to a decrease in the accumulation of sucrose and starch synthesis enzymes, thus potentially influencing fruit quality [
