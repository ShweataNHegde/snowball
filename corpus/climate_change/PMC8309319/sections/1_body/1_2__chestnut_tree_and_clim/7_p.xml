<p>The chestnut trees prosper on plains or very gentle hills and mountainsides, as soils with good drainage better support root structures [

 <xref rid="B12-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It reveals a poor adaptation to chalky or clay soil but appreciates sedimentary, siliceous, and acidic to neutral soils [

 <xref rid="B40-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Wind-sheltered locations, with adequate temperatures and precipitation, accompanied by good solar exposure, are the best option for the installation of chestnut crops [

 <xref rid="B8-plants-10-01463" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], which combines soil and temperature indicators, confirmed that low water soil availability and high temperatures are destabilizing factors for chestnut growth, inducing a loss of plant vigor and making the trees vulnerable to ink disease.
