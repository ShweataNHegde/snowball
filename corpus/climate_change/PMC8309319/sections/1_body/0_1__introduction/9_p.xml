<p>According to the previous lines, it is vital to recognize the impacts of climate change on chestnut trees, improving our current understanding of climate-tree interconnections. Assessing climate change projections under different anthropogenic radiative forcing scenarios, their potential impacts on chestnut tree growth and development, chestnut yield and quality attributes, as well as the identification of suitable and effective adaptation measures, are of foremost relevance for the future sustainability of chestnut cultivation. The present review aims to provide some clues on how climate change may impact chestnut tree cultivation in Europe, as well as to offer an overview of the possible adaptation measures (short- and long-term) that are currently available for chestnut growers. After this introductory section, in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2-plants-10-01463">Section 2</xref>, the Chestnut Tree and Climate Influences are discussed. 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-plants-10-01463">Section 3</xref> is devoted to the Climate Change Projections and Chestnut Growing Conditions. Lastly,
