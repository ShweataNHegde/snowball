It is cultivated due to the high value of its fruits and wood. The evolution between <i>Castanea</i> biodiversity and humans has resulted in the spread of chestnut genetic diversity. In 2019, the chestnut tree area worldwide was approximately 596 \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup> ha for fruit production (Southern Europe, Southwestern United States of America, and Asia).

Over the years, there have been some productivity changes, in part associated with climate change. Climate is considered one of the main drivers of biodiversity and ecosystem change. In the future, new challenges associated with climate change are expected, which could threaten this crop. It is essential to identify the impacts of climate change on chestnut trees, improving the current understanding of climate-tree interconnections.
