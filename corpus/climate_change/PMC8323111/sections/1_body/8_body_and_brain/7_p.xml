<p>This and other work suggest that climate change may have complicated impacts on animals’ sensing. “We don’t know how each species is going to react to these changes,” Velez says. Some fish, such as those that dwell near CO
 <sub>2</sub> vents, can tolerate high concentrations of CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Other animals may be less resilient. Velez and her colleagues are studying more species, including top predators such as sharks, to further explore the potential impacts of acidified waters.
