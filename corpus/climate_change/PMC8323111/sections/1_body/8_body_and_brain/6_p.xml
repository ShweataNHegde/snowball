<p>The team has also sought to separate the effects of increased CO
 <sub>2</sub> and changes in acidity. For instance, to create acidic conditions without using CO
 <sub>2</sub>, the researchers add hydrochloric acid to water that flows by the fishes’ nostrils. Or, to lower the acidity when CO
 <sub>2</sub> is added, they use sodium hydroxide. Both increased CO
 <sub>2</sub> and decreased pH

 <sub>2</sub> itself are higher than [the effects of] the pH,” Velez says. The mechanism behind these changes isn’t fully clear, but the scientists hypothesize that the increased CO
 <sub>2</sub> may decrease the intracellular pH of olfactory neurons by interfering with an enzyme involved in regulating pH.
