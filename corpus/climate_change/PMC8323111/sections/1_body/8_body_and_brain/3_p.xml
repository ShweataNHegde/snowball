<p>One theory to explain behavioral changes suggests modifications to the nervous system. A team—which includes members whose other papers have been disputed—put forth the idea that fish respond to high CO

Hubbard’s team is now working to probe this theory more directly by measuring concentrations of ions in the cerebrospinal fluid and, eventually, inside fishes’ neurons.
