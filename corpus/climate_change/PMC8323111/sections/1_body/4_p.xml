<p>A changing climate may make chemical communication for sea creatures more challenging. By the year 2100, the pH of the ocean—currently about 8.1—is expected to drop to 7.7 if atmospheric carbon dioxide continues to rise. Over the past decade, research has revealed how sensitive chemoreception systems are and how they may take a hit from human activities that cause pollution, warming waters, and ocean acidification. For instance, higher CO

In the wild, that could make it harder for the fish to find food and can render them more vulnerable to predators, says Peter C. Hubbard, an electrophysiologist at the Center of Marine Sciences in Portugal. And for migratory fish, such as salmon, lowered olfactory sensitivity may mean difficulty in navigating rivers for spawning.
