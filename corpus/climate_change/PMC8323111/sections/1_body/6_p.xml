That makes it important to investigate the underlying mechanisms and the magnitude of the effects. Understanding such mechanisms could help make sense of confusing, difficult-to-replicate behavioral findings. So scientists continue to work to untangle the basic workings of marine chemoreception, from identifying signaling molecules to finding the receptors that they bind.
