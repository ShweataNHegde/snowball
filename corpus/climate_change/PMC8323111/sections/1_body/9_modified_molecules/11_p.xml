Some effects may cascade through ecosystems if top predators are impacted. By studying effects at multiple levels of the food chain, researchers hope to inform policy makers about changes in conservation efforts that can protect ecosystems. Even though scientists don’t understand all the details of the processes they’re studying, Velez adds, if people don’t act to reduce emissions, species may disappear.
