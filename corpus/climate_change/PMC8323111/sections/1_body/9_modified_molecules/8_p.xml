<p>“I potentially am interested in every single molecule,” Roggatz says. “But the problem is we actually don’t know that many” molecules with defined ecological functions. Many studies use poorly characterized mixtures, sometimes extracts from marine critters or even squished-up organisms, as proxies for molecules that affect biology and behavior. The compounds could potentially be peptides, nucleic acids, or fatty acids, making identification even more difficult.</p>
