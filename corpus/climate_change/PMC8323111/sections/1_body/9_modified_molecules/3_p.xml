<p>Knowing that marine pH could drop from 8.1 to 7.7 by the turn of the century, Christina C. Roggatz, a marine chemical ecologist at the University of Hull, and her colleagues decided to investigate whether signaling molecules were sensitive to pH in this range. The team picked a few peptides that mimic molecules that female shore crabs use as cues to care for their eggs. The eggs release the molecules when they need oxygen, prompting their mother to swing them from side to side to increase ventilation. Later, the molecules trigger the female to send the eggs into the water so that all the larvae hatch at the same time, Roggatz says. The actual signaling molecules arenâ€™t known, but the synthetic stand-ins promote the same behaviors.</p>
