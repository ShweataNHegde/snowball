  <p>Shapes of peptides (GHK and GGR) that mimic chemical cues used by crabs shift when pH is lowered from current ocean levels (8.1) to those predicted at the turn of the century (7.7). As the ocean turns more acidic, such molecular changes could alter crab behavior. Credit: Christina C. Roggatz.</p>
