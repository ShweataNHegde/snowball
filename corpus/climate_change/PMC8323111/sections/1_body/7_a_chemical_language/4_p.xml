Genetics and bioinformatics are also helping to decipher the vast chemical vocabulary of sea creatures, including organisms that are difficult to cultivate. “We don’t have to grow massive culture flasks,” Kubanek says. “We can just get a small sample, sequence these partial genomes, and start to infer their chemistry.”
