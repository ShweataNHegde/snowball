<p>Improved analytical techniques are helping pin down those molecules. Kubanek and colleagues have observed that when tiny predatory crustaceans called copepods are around, single-celled organisms called dinoflagellates boost their production of toxic compounds for defense. Using chemical separation techniques paired with NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, the team traced the trigger for the toxicity uptick to a
