<p id="Par16">If one were to define the climate change investment and finance flows narrowly as financial resources coming from “multilateral climate funds”
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn3">3</xref> (including the Green Climate Fund, Adaptation Fund, etc.), 152 climate change investment and finance projects valued at over $2 billion were implemented across 70 countries in 2017, with half of the total ($1 billion) coming from the Green Climate Fund (Watson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2018</xref>). Seven multilateral climate funds were responsible for $11.7 billion for 967 projects between 2001 and 2016 and helped mobilize more than$70 billion in additional financing from the private sector and other sources (Amerasinghe et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2017</xref>). If one were to use a broader measure of climate change investment and finance flows to include a wide range of public, private, and public–private initiatives (e.g., electric utility investing in a green grid project), climate change investment and finance flows would reach $612 billion in 2017 (Buchner et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2019</xref>).
