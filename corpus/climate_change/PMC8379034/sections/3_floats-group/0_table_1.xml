   <tr>
    <td align="left">● Sustainable development is a societal rather than an environmental challenge</td>

   <tr>
    <td align="left">● Responsible consumption and production cut across several of the other transitions so adopting some sort of a circular economy approach and reducing demand is important</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td align="left">● It is possible to decarbonize the energy system around 2050 while providing clean and affordable energy for all, including through energy efficiency, more renewables, and electrification</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td align="left">● Achieving access to nutritional food and clean water for all, while protecting the biosphere and the oceans, requires more efficient and sustainable food systems</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td align="left">● Transforming our settlement patterns will benefit the majority of the world population—such as through “smart” infrastructure, decent housing, and high connectivity</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td align="left">● Science, technology, and innovations is a powerful driver, but the direction of change needs to support sustainable development. In particular, much depends on the way the world will put the information technology revolution to use</td>
